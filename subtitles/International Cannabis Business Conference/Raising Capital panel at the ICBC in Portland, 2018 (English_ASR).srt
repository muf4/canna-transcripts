the investment panel something that is a

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,820
very hot button sort of item right now

19
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:05,399
and we've got two great experts we've

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:10,859
got Tedrow and arthur quan i don't want

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:15,109
to bring up what we're gonna do is talk

22
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:19,019
about investment and the need for

23
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:21,809
investment is as we all know so if you

24
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,608
plan to scale in this space right now

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,909
things have sort of reached a different

26
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:32,429
level and as we're seeing with big

27
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,368
private equity starting to come in and

28
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:37,769
obviously big money North in Canada

29
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:40,170
where federally they had their standing

30
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,319
allows them to raise massive amounts of

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,049
capital we've seen Constellation Brands

32
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,978
come in and dump four million dollars

33
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:54,090
into canopy blowing that valuation up we

34
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:56,849
see tilray of popping it over evaluation

35
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,659
of basically making them a bigger

36
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:03,499
company than in American Airlines and

37
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,139
other very large concerns over there

38
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:09,689
which underscores the need for if you're

39
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:12,000
going to compete you need to be able to

40
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,219
be well capitalized and we've got a

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,439
couple great resources here that did

42
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,919
that bring very different perspectives

43
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,229
to investors the

44
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,530
because these are the folks that will

45
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,789
help you raise money and they're the

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,810
folks that will help you make sure that

47
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:32,459
you do it compliantly so I'll just have

48
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:36,000
Arthur first just say a few things about

49
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:41,640
what you do in your company the can of

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,360
Income Fund okay hi my name is Arthur

51
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,669
Kwon on I'm a Canadian I run a private

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,910
equity fund up in Canada called Kenna

53
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:54,419
Income Fund we got started earlier this

54
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:58,289
year by way of background I was a former

55
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:04,399
investment banker for 18 years in Canada

56
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:07,169
so can i Income Fund is a diversified

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,750
cannabis investment fund we we invest

58
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,250
across the entire value chain of the

59
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,068
cannabis sector so cultivation

60
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:18,000
extraction production ancillary services

61
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:20,699
and dispensaries today we have eight

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,810
investments in our portfolio and we're

63
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:26,669
actively looking into the US right now

64
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:30,090
awesome and then we've got Ted Rowe who

65
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:33,059
is a legal professional and someone very

66
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,689
well versed in in the industry here in

67
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:41,670
Oregon Ted a little bit some about

68
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,599
yourself your practice testing oh there

69
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,578
we go

70
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,379
my name is Ted Rowe I'm an American I am

71
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:53,579
a practicing attorney based here in

72
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:57,090
Portland I've been representing clients

73
00:03:53,579 --> 00:04:00,810
in a variety of industries for over 20

74
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,060
years I have been representing people in

75
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,479
the cannabis industry for well over 10

76
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,120
years now I also represent foreign

77
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,250
companies sometimes that are investors

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,039
sometimes that are involved in cases

79
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,279
already in the United States I

80
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:21,988
specialize in business and intellectual

81
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,250
property excellent thanks so Ted we'll

82
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,750
go right back to you

83
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:29,459
so I think something that really

84
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,540
interesting about your perspective is

85
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:37,229
that you work with different types of

86
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:40,280
entities clearly and in investment

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,960
circles there's a huge line between

88
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,689
being a company that touches a plant

89
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,750
versus a company that engages in an

90
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:54,689
ancillary business that does not so with

91
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:56,730
software platforms pipes Hardware do you

92
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:59,540
have do you are there different

93
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,710
strategies for approaching investors

94
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,620
based on the type of business that you

95
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:07,229
run that's an excellent question because

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,819
sometimes I represent businesses that

97
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,700
are seeking capital and sometimes I

98
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:15,719
represent the investors so I have a

99
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:18,300
perspective from both points of view I

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,290
would say with ancillary businesses

101
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,540
we're dealing with something that's

102
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,370
essentially unregulated and I mean

103
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,420
unregulated in a way that is no

104
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:30,269
different than a non cannabis business

105
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,560
so how you approach investors in there

106
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,649
are there are going to be some

107
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,120
similarities for example some one of the

108
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:38,579
things that you're going to want to

109
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,540
ensure when you're looking at investors

110
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:45,560
I'm sure Arthur can speak to this as

111
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:50,819
well is that you want to have a proper

112
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:53,930
valuation of your company and and I can

113
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,430
speak about this later if we like about

114
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,040
some of the brief regulations that

115
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:03,000
you're going to need to comply with SEC

116
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,730
regulations even to sell securities sell

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,519
stock in your company essentially but

118
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,439
one of the big things I see a problem

119
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,689
with frequently and it's across the

120
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,689
board whether it's ancillary or direct

121
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,790
cannabis businesses is an improper

122
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,129
valuation done with of your company and

123
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,020
this creates a couple of problems one is

124
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,180
it's hard to have an investor take you

125
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,789
seriously because they know what the

126
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,100
businesses are worth and so if you're

127
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,290
coming in substantially overvalued it's

128
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,070
hard to attract investors to begin with

129
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,939
number two is it creates actual legal

130
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:40,019
problems

131
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:43,019
are you well if you over value your

132
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,060
company and then people invest in it you

133
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,729
have a potential pretty high likelihood

134
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,949
actually that you could buy into what's

135
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,200
called the minority shareholder lawsuit

136
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,509
where if you can't deliver on the

137
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,370
numbers that you're talking about which

138
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,550
is very hard when you over value a

139
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,930
company that minority shareholder is

140
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:07,410
going to sue you and as a corporate

141
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:10,769
officer you have a duty a fiduciary duty

142
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:13,020
legal duty to minority shareholders so

143
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:15,719
that's one thing to keep in mind another

144
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:19,769
thing that is different in how you

145
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:24,870
approach investors from whether it's

146
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:28,199
ancillary or cannabis related is are

147
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:32,579
they permitted to invest in your company

148
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,319
to begin with and we had a we had an

149
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,469
interesting discussion in the green room

150
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,310
before we came out about this and that

151
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,960
is if it's an ancillary service anyone

152
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,939
can invest in it it can be a foreign

153
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,599
national it can be someone from another

154
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:51,029
state however if it's a direct cannabis

155
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,570
business if you're if it requires a

156
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:58,859
state license as a producer retailer or

157
00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:02,430
wholesaler or processor for example in

158
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,770
Washington not only can foreign

159
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,050
nationals not you can't even can't even

160
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:10,319
be from another state you have to be an

161
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:14,370
Oregon resident I'm sorry Washington

162
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:18,029
resident Oregon has a much less strict

163
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,910
scheme however that being said there's

164
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:24,119
nothing in the regulations that permits

165
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,620
it it just doesn't not allow it if that

166
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,980
makes sense and but there are problems

167
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,668
for example we have to get background

168
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:39,120
checks to be a licensed in the in a

169
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:41,728
direct cannabis business in Oregon how

170
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,279
can organ do that if it's a foreign

171
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,920
national what makes it tough is if

172
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,419
you're for instance a a company that's

173
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,269
regulated you've got

174
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,189
you got to do background checks if you

175
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:57,328
have a public company for instance

176
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,370
that's on your that owns more than 20%

177
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:02,729
of your company then technically

178
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,019
everybody from that public company all

179
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,120
the directors would need to get

180
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,850
background checks for the application

181
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,100
for a grow or a dispensary so that's a

182
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,190
little prohibitive but those are great

183
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,769
points to let's maybe shift a little bit

184
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,660
to one of the interesting things having

185
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,110
a Canadian you guys are the guys with

186
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:26,610
all the money right now and access to

187
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:30,600
capital being what it is there are a lot

188
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,120
less companies actually making money in

189
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,269
cannabis in Canada relative to the US

190
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,578
and so right now we we spoke you've got

191
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,659
several investments in Canadian concerns

192
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,809
and right now you're evaluating

193
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:46,049
opportunities in the US no that's that's

194
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,819
right you know the the interesting thing

195
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:52,169
about the US market that we're finding

196
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:54,440
is that a lot of companies that were you

197
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:58,229
know we're evaluating either in

198
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,630
California or Nevada or Florida they all

199
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,579
have revenue and and most of them

200
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,549
actually not only do they have revenue

201
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:07,759
but that's they have positive cash flow

202
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:12,569
and that's a bit of a refreshing change

203
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,980
from in Canada so for example there's

204
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,079
about a hundred and twenty ticker

205
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,659
symbols on my screen right now of

206
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,479
cannabis and cannabis related companies

207
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:24,659
on either the Canadian Securities

208
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:30,089
Exchange or the Toronto Venture Exchange

209
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:33,299
or the big board TSX but I you know most

210
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:36,750
of them are at the preview stage and you

211
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:39,479
know in our portfolio of companies only

212
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:43,110
two of them are in revenue so so that's

213
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,940
why we like the US market so much and

214
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,269
we're actively seeking investments I

215
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,649
mean you know there's certain foreign

216
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:53,970
investment requirements that we need to

217
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:55,100
follow but there's a lot of capital in

218
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,410
Canada

219
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,540
Arthur are there specific verticals or

220
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:04,649
segments of the business that you guys

221
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:06,929
find more attractive yeah so the almost

222
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:10,529
all the companies that were evaluating

223
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:14,309
evaluating right now are vertically

224
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:19,079
integrated or they have multi licenses

225
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:20,969
across multi states that seems to be you

226
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,530
know the area that's attracting the most

227
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,090
amount of capital so it's no surprise

228
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:27,000
that you know there's been a

229
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,790
proliferation of US companies doing our

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,340
TOS or reverse takeovers onto the

231
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:35,490
Canadian Securities Exchange so you know

232
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,040
we all know about Mad Men green thumb

233
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:41,940
industries I'm aware of at least eight

234
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,949
other US companies that are filing

235
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,830
they're listing statements or prospectus

236
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:51,020
is to become listed on the CSC right now

237
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:54,270
so it's it's a it's a very hot market

238
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:58,110
very much so so we we actually discussed

239
00:11:54,269 --> 00:12:01,710
and I think in in both sort of comments

240
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,779
there I think valuation is a big thing

241
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:08,639
so I think maybe to come back to that

242
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:11,339
and we can sort of both yours as far as

243
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,799
opinions or their multiples right now

244
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,259
that we're seeing that are sort of

245
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:19,199
prevailing how you value your business X

246
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:24,860
amount of income equals this value or

247
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:27,960
revenue okay yeah so when we look at

248
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,759
evaluating a potential investments we

249
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,710
look at three things so the first one is

250
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,509
the management team and the board of

251
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,160
directors you know what have they done

252
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:38,399
before their track record their

253
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,529
backgrounds then the second criteria is

254
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,169
in generally speaking we look at the

255
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,209
business plan you know what segments of

256
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:47,370
the value chain they're in whether we

257
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,920
see it as and what's their niche or

258
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,889
their competitive advantage in that

259
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:56,009
segment and lastly we look at valuation

260
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:58,740
and it's no surprise that the the

261
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:01,500
valuations are just insane in the public

262
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,200
markets and we you know we see quite a

263
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,169
lot so so when we're evaluating

264
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,049
companies

265
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:12,178
in Remy you what we typically do is we

266
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:16,358
apply a some sort of financial metric so

267
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:18,578
maybe ev2 EBIT or price to cash flow or

268
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:21,040
price to revenue and we take a discount

269
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:24,458
of that to the publicly traded

270
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:27,129
comparables if a company is pre-revenue

271
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:29,528
then that's a that's a general rule of

272
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:31,089
thumb where we we need to be comfortable

273
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:33,068
with the management team and their

274
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:36,369
ability to execute on a business plan

275
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:40,118
and if they're coming to us at say a

276
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:42,579
pretty money valuation of X million we

277
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:45,040
have to justify that and with a company

278
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:47,558
that's you know that doesn't have Remy

279
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,278
you the the financial metrics go out the

280
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:53,230
door then it's it's more of a

281
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,879
qualitative judgment on management as

282
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,659
opposed to a quantitative peer

283
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,850
quantitative measure and probably you're

284
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:02,980
leaning on you know scarcity or sort of

285
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:06,609
other variables there that make that

286
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,739
offering unique yeah did you have some

287
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:12,730
insight absolutely I agree in large part

288
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:14,110
with what Arthur said I've seen one of

289
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,438
the largest things that you discussed

290
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,350
that's important to my clients when

291
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:24,548
their investors are the management team

292
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:27,639
and definitely my clients have had me do

293
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:29,678
checks on background checks on board of

294
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,220
directors of companies before they put a

295
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:35,828
penny in but that being said and I agree

296
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,720
also that with existing companies that

297
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:40,328
have an existing revenue stream it's

298
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:44,949
somewhat easier to to approximate

299
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:49,568
valuation you know you have hard assets

300
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:52,808
you have your P&amp;L you can look at to

301
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:55,798
start giving you an idea of the value of

302
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:59,558
a company beyond the the more esoteric

303
00:14:55,798 --> 00:15:03,608
valuations of how how much do you trust

304
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:07,480
the directors of the company to affect

305
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:10,350
their their business plan I think the

306
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,928
real problem exists when it is a

307
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,329
pre-revenue company when you're even

308
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:16,850
more difficult when it's a pre-license

309
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:18,739
company

310
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,509
in this industry where you have a

311
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,698
start-up you don't even have a license

312
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:27,350
yet how do you value this company and I

313
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:30,139
think that's a real question I think

314
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:33,139
what it ultimately comes down to when if

315
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:35,269
you set aside the value of the

316
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,639
particular individuals involved in the

317
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,379
business and look at just dollar

318
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,399
valuation how do we do this

319
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:45,139
I often advise my clients when I'm

320
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,028
representing that not the investors but

321
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:51,829
the other side the business raising the

322
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:54,470
capital to look at just like when you're

323
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:58,250
selling or by owning buying real estate

324
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,170
you look at comps so often we will say

325
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,399
okay we don't want overvalued the

326
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:04,879
company but we don't want to cut our

327
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,940
legs out from us we want to be right in

328
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,399
there something realistic so we can look

329
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,709
to comparable businesses and what kind

330
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,409
of revenue they're doing to kind of fill

331
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:17,899
in that X in the equation although there

332
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:21,318
is no magic equation that gets you to

333
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:24,289
the answer what ultimately you're gonna

334
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:28,879
have to do is do an appropriate

335
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:30,679
valuation based on comparable businesses

336
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,879
what they're doing in the comparable

337
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:37,278
market because what a cannabis retailer

338
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,740
does in Seattle is not what they do in

339
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,470
Portland is not what they do in Miami is

340
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,649
not what they do in LA it just isn't

341
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,778
so it has to be you you have to use

342
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:50,539
comparable numbers and you can't kind of

343
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:52,730
over blow this but a start-up might be

344
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:55,639
much more valuable if they already owned

345
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,379
existing real estate because there are

346
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,480
all kinds especially from foreign

347
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:01,759
investment because if the foreign

348
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,319
investor doesn't have to invest in real

349
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,699
estate there's a whole federal law they

350
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:10,869
don't need to comply with them to all

351
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:16,240
say this actually as from being an

352
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:21,168
investor in an operator one thing is

353
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:23,779
looking at investors and trying to

354
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:25,280
derive a valuation as a company I think

355
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:27,619
it's also really really important to

356
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,808
look at the kind of investor and how

357
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,869
strategic that money

358
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:35,000
went coming up with the value can that

359
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:37,149
investor do anything else for you can he

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,990
open more doors is he going to be there

361
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:45,050
after you execute and commit to round

362
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,990
two rounds the following rounds and so I

363
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:52,159
think there's there's a lot of sort of

364
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:55,279
sort of beyond how you measure that the

365
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,630
proper investor and a sort of a

366
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,079
strategic part and going forward I think

367
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,460
there's a lot of things that you look at

368
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:05,000
from the other side as well as a company

369
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,850
that that's looking for funding and what

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,890
number I'd be comfortable with given

371
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:12,619
what that investor is and the other sort

372
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,960
of resources that they bring right no

373
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:17,269
absolutely I agree with that you know

374
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,410
it's it is a competitive space up in

375
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:24,379
Canada for for both capital and good

376
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,850
what I would call good deal flow so for

377
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,940
example one of the companies that we

378
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:31,399
invested in is a consumables company

379
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,200
they're positioning themselves for the

380
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,620
when that segment of the market becomes

381
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,440
legal up in Canada and they you know

382
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:41,569
they were being courted by several other

383
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,390
private equity firms including us and

384
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:46,579
one of the reasons why they chose to go

385
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,850
with us is because of the strategic

386
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:52,970
value that that we bring to the table

387
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:55,250
you know we were pretty well networked

388
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,620
in Canada we can open up a lot of doors

389
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,910
in terms of their distribution and

390
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:03,979
dispensaries strategies and their

391
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:07,610
manufacturing strategies so I think it

392
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,009
you know from from the company's point

393
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:11,899
of view you know you should always look

394
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:13,849
at what type of investment dollars and

395
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,280
that's why you know for a public company

396
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:21,439
that are that's raising capital in

397
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:23,509
Canada there's a tendency to to bring on

398
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,630
you know the fast money the the guys

399
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:28,819
that are in it for a short term trade

400
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,950
whereas on the private equity side you

401
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:33,289
know the the companies that we're

402
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,769
talking to are more interested in you

403
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:39,609
know the the type of money the strategic

404
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:43,240
value that the investors bring to the

405
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:44,589
evil not just dollars that's that's an

406
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,920
excellent issue that you raised and

407
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:51,369
since I'm I'm assuming I could be wrong

408
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,289
but most of you are businesses wanting

409
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:55,839
to raise capital and not investors

410
00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:00,339
looking to invest in cannabis businesses

411
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:03,009
so I want to say this as well and that

412
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:05,500
is don't think that you're the only one

413
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:08,259
who has to have the background checks

414
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,210
done you should check out your investors

415
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,829
you should know who they are you should

416
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,529
talk to other people who they've done

417
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:17,470
deals with you should know their

418
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:19,359
motivation and one actually in Ted you

419
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,039
know what a good point is if if if

420
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,399
anyone is worth their weight they'll be

421
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,710
happy to give you resources on folks

422
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,669
that they've done deals with and well

423
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:33,700
those folks should obviously you know

424
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:35,410
obviously be proponents of these guys so

425
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,340
they should that's something to ask

426
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,919
absolutely and if there is a

427
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,329
circumstance where you're asking for

428
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,270
essentially deal references and they're

429
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:49,178
unwilling to give them that is a large

430
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:51,639
red flag and I don't care what they're

431
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:54,070
promising you that is a that is a

432
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,520
serious red flag in and I'm not saying

433
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:59,769
just drop the deal but I would be very

434
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:03,759
wary about moving forward without

435
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:05,829
additional information that being said I

436
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,808
also want to let you know that there you

437
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:11,409
there's more than one way to raise money

438
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:13,298
for your businesses the two we've talked

439
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,669
about one of them which is essentially

440
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:17,829
equity investment but that's not the

441
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:21,160
only way of doing this you can structure

442
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:24,069
these deals essentially any way you want

443
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,330
and one of the large ways of doing that

444
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:30,399
is debt financing or essentially

445
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:32,558
obtaining loans and actually when I'm

446
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,669
representing companies like yours rather

447
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:40,839
than the investors I tell them to I tell

448
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:43,870
them to kind of steer away try to steer

449
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:47,918
away from equity investment as much as

450
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:49,928
you can rather than maybe do a one-year

451
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,080
loan that it's called a convertible note

452
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,250
it converts to a

453
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:57,839
to equity at the end of that year

454
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:02,730
because if you're doing the loan in the

455
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:05,699
name of the business for example and the

456
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,769
you say you're a producer and the in the

457
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,600
crop fails or and the business ends up

458
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:12,778
going under you also don't want to have

459
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:17,629
personal liability for you know a two

460
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:19,528
million dollar loan but at the same time

461
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,620
you need to know who you're doing

462
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:25,710
business with because does this investor

463
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:29,939
have eyes on taking the business over

464
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:32,970
you know business is business they say

465
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,298
that for a reason and and you need to be

466
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,600
sophisticated businesspeople and your

467
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:43,109
strengths may lie in other areas

468
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:44,849
processing retail production but this is

469
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:46,259
what I start I started one night when I

470
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:48,629
first started lecturing at these things

471
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:51,419
years ago and I talked about tax

472
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,278
consequences I said I understand that a

473
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,970
lot of people who started in this

474
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:59,609
industry were operating to a certain

475
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,409
level of illegality for a long time but

476
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:02,729
now that it's in the light everything

477
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:04,940
has to be on the up-and-up

478
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,950
you got a pair taxes you got to pay your

479
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,470
property taxes employment taxes you got

480
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:13,919
to comply with your regulations these

481
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,538
licenses are extremely valuable and you

482
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,960
don't want to do anything that's going

483
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:20,908
to jeopardize them but that being said

484
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,548
look at all the options available to you

485
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:26,130
and not just one when it comes to the

486
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:28,349
issue of raising capital because debt

487
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,470
financing is a perfectly legitimate way

488
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:33,298
of raising capital for your companies or

489
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:37,110
you go up and you win the pitch at the

490
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:38,429
ICBC like my folks over there so here's

491
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:40,019
what we want to do i I think that

492
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,028
there's they're business owners here in

493
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:45,750
the room and and we're sitting here

494
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:47,099
because investment is some interesting

495
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,138
stuff and I think there may be some

496
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:50,579
questions out there so I think we're

497
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:53,009
getting kind of down to it and I want to

498
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,138
make sure that if there are questions

499
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:58,788
out there that that we can address them

500
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:58,788
so take it out

501
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:04,920
wait wait let me bring the microphone to

502
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,539
you everybody well no it's easier it's

503
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,789
part of these gettin paid he's we're

504
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:12,649
taping it right also it's part of my job

505
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:15,599
description yeah yeah the Union rule sir

506
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:17,759
in this Oregon marketplace which in the

507
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,709
last year is turned into people really

508
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,079
needing to cut back and get smaller and

509
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,789
get tight and get you know much more

510
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,619
control over their costs and get control

511
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:28,200
over the actual amount that can be sold

512
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,939
in this Mart in the market how then can

513
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,259
you think about evaluation when you're

514
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,450
looking at a traditional thing I can

515
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:36,169
multiply our Viva de I mean if you're

516
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:38,730
being because of an artificially

517
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:41,100
restricted marketplace the amount that's

518
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:43,500
actually able to be sold is restricted

519
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:45,058
how do you think about if you're a small

520
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,500
time you know we're a small farm and

521
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:48,509
we're looking to get outside investment

522
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,089
and we have to put a valuation on

523
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:52,829
ourselves how do we ourselves think

524
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,178
about it in terms of our brain trust in

525
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:56,849
terms of our equipment in terms of our

526
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,950
proprietary ways of going knowing that

527
00:24:56,849 --> 00:25:00,089
multipliers sometimes you know show

528
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,620
things the wrong way I mean that's

529
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:05,220
that's one big number one of our

530
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:09,029
problems well starting on that because I

531
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,558
think it's a great question but I don't

532
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:14,460
think it does anything to actually

533
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,889
really turn any of the the numbers

534
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,569
upside down at all I think you're still

535
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,759
market share and I think it's par for

536
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:22,529
the course because your competitors are

537
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,650
dealing with the same issues right so

538
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,660
there was a race to the bottom your guys

539
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,640
that the the price is here that you know

540
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,470
the bottom fell out and but you guys are

541
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,120
all dealing with it right and at the end

542
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,360
of the day you still have numbers you're

543
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,189
still you've got product going to stores

544
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,808
everyone's margins are down everyone's

545
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,269
numbers are down but at the end of the

546
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:45,269
day if you have market share here when

547
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:48,089
then when the market goes back up your

548
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:51,168
margins will rise I think obviously a

549
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:53,879
big part in something that folks do know

550
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:56,400
serious investors do know about the push

551
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,130
for Oregon to be an export state and

552
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,870
that's clearly something that you all in

553
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:11,700
this state really need to fight for

554
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:15,839
really need to fight for and in all your

555
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,610
competitors those are comps I would

556
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,879
argue that you have more comps than

557
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:22,678
other markets do I understand your

558
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,309
problem isn't that the comps are all

559
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,140
down but that's not the he's just trying

560
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:30,990
to find the data the information how do

561
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,460
you find like doing what you talk to

562
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,710
people like you you need to talk to

563
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,440
people but that's not the only asset

564
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,110
that you have you talked about one

565
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,549
potential revenue stream that can

566
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:44,699
potentially I'm not saying it can but it

567
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,710
potentially can cross state boundaries

568
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:51,480
and that is intellectual property you

569
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:56,429
can license processes and that can be a

570
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,759
revenue stream for you and and IP is one

571
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,040
of those things that can be more easily

572
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,679
valued than the entire business but I

573
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,480
understand I'm talking about I got my

574
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,759
weed it's worth less now and how do I

575
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,289
value that but yeah so as a business

576
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,419
owner if you're looking for outside

577
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:16,168
investment but you're worried about

578
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:19,160
valuation and multiples of EBIT you know

579
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:22,440
said there are other

580
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,808
non-dilutive investment vehicles so you

581
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,990
know loans are just one of them but you

582
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:32,579
know I know of three Canadian companies

583
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:35,460
that are offering royalties to US

584
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:38,759
businesses so gross overriding royalties

585
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,460
of gores is one secure convertible notes

586
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,640
or convertible debentures so there's

587
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,990
other avenues outside of equity where

588
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
you need to place a value on your

589
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,429
business to access capital that's a

590
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,529
great point and also you don't want it

591
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,048
that's the one thing is right now if you

592
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:58,740
do have to raise and valuations or being

593
00:27:55,048 --> 00:28:01,619
depressed then actually debt financing

594
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,890
it's a pretty good way to sort of hedge

595
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:08,399
against that yeah more questions and

596
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:10,309
Gayo the past administration had a

597
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,990
hands-off kind of

598
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:13,579
with the current administration is there

599
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:17,798
any concern of the feds coming in and

600
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:23,048
making some sort of headways or waves I

601
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:25,879
guess I can speak to that there has been

602
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:27,558
well Jeff Sessions did say that he

603
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,919
wanted to take a more active role in

604
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:33,470
curbing marijuana industry cannabis

605
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:36,350
industry in the United States that's

606
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,720
absolutely true the Cole memorandum

607
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:41,689
still exists though there's been nothing

608
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,569
else that's overridden that that being

609
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,298
said we had a discussion earlier where

610
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:49,849
we were talking about foreign investment

611
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:51,109
and what effects that could have what

612
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:53,658
could come into play in the United

613
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:56,869
States with regard to foreign investment

614
00:28:53,659 --> 00:29:01,880
into a direct cannabis industry and I

615
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:05,569
talked about it's called a 18 USC 1952

616
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:10,880
it's a federal law that prohibits and

617
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:14,269
criminalizes the promoting distribution

618
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,028
and there's all these adjectives of any

619
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:19,638
illegal activity and since cannabis is

620
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:20,778
still listed in the Controlled

621
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:23,058
Substances Act

622
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:27,048
technically foreign investment could be

623
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:29,960
viewed as a violation of that law not

624
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:33,440
being said as far as I know it's not

625
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,649
being prosecuted but that doesn't mean

626
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,740
it won't be and and given the current

627
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:42,349
administration I fell let's put it this

628
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:46,778
way I felt safer under wealth in general

629
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:50,500
under the Obama administration so sure

630
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:55,130
just in general you think

631
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:57,710
hello there so I'm currently actually an

632
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:00,110
Oregon laboratory of I'm I'm the oldest

633
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:04,429
laboratory in Oregon for a test cannabis

634
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:06,619
and I'm seeking expansion I've been

635
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,890
warned that if I get investment money

636
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:10,229
from Canada

637
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:13,590
already been some people that have done

638
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,200
this and something about not being able

639
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:20,429
to cross borders and come across or vice

640
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,460
versa because of the investment can you

641
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:26,160
do can you help clarify what alright

642
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,299
that's about yep so you're absolutely

643
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,860
right I mean I'm aware of several

644
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:34,139
Canadians that have been banned for life

645
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:36,959
from entering into the u.s. because they

646
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,570
have either invested in a cannabis

647
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,100
company or smoked cannabis or try

648
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:45,839
cannabis and even you know myself I was

649
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:49,230
just seeing this too dead in the green

650
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:52,799
room when I came from Canada I I

651
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,990
actually brought two phones you know my

652
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,809
real phone that I put in my luggage and

653
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,670
then a burner phone in case I get

654
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,250
stopped at the border but that's the

655
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,200
risk that you you know as a Canadian

656
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:07,740
looking to invest in US companies you

657
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,519
you have to you have to take and but you

658
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:15,509
know what I can say is that you know

659
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:19,170
there's there's that has not in my mind

660
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:22,619
deterred any Canadians from looking into

661
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:24,450
the US you know there's there several

662
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,849
financial companies and investment

663
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,340
companies that are all actively looking

664
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:31,619
into the u.s. because you the one thing

665
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:34,679
about Canada is that while there's no

666
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:36,419
shortage of cannabis companies like I

667
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,110
said before most of them are at the

668
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,220
pre-revenue stage and if you look at the

669
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:44,579
multiples that these companies are being

670
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:47,240
traded at it's you know it's it's very

671
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:47,240
lofty

672
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:57,379
I've never heard of that before though

673
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,829
so I think that if you go so at the

674
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:04,450
border if they ask you for what you do

675
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:04,449
you don't tell them cannabis yeah

676
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,819
well I don't think he said you should

677
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,069
lie and he just said but not don't if

678
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:25,019
you're if you're in production you can

679
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:28,349
tell them you're a farmer and they still

680
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,129
have that be a true statement go ahead

681
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:31,799
and do your thing

682
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,679
see what happens it it's it's a funny

683
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,329
story I just told them I just told them

684
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,830
I was attending a conference and they

685
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,599
were like which conference oh yeah the

686
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:41,639
International Canopus business

687
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,349
conference and then they're like did you

688
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,270
bring any cannabis no you guys got

689
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:46,889
pretty good weed here at Vancouver and

690
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:49,889
they're like enjoy your you enjoy your

691
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:52,320
vacation sir so that happened when I

692
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,330
left Berlin too so I mean I don't think

693
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,069
you need to let on that you're a million

694
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:57,808
dollar investor and a bunch of cannabis

695
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:59,519
industries or whatever but you know if

696
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,690
you're just coming to town to throw a

697
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,129
conference that they're throwing they

698
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,420
can't sweat you too much I don't know

699
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,950
who knows what this American

700
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,140
government's gonna do that's all you

701
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:10,500
know what's ironic about this is that

702
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,040
the US has been promoting programs for

703
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,509
many years that that solicit investment

704
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,490
from foreign nationals so they're called

705
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:23,429
a eb-5 programs where this is a really

706
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,289
large thing in China it's a way that and

707
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:27,540
it's a way to fast-track somebody's

708
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:29,759
immigration status in the United States

709
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:32,909
they can become an US citizen within a

710
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,009
couple of years if they I think it's

711
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,779
five million dollars for certain under

712
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:41,420
certain projects or ten million dollars

713
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:45,599
under others but I think that we are

714
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,250
doing our own country to service by not

715
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,719
allowing this kind of foreign investment

716
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:51,450
into u.s. we could be bringing in

717
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,650
substantial what it does is it brings

718
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:58,110
forth the how fractured the the the laws

719
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:01,470
are between state and federal because

720
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:04,079
when you've got a Canadian coming from a

721
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,779
place where federally what he does is

722
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,869
legal and he's coming to California

723
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:12,389
where you know we pay our taxes or

724
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:15,000
Oregon where we pay our taxes and we pay

725
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:18,119
for our permits and you know we're

726
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,128
vested in in this industry yet it's

727
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,100
still a crime because of the federal

728
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:25,289
level the federal layer so it's just

729
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:26,909
part of the goofy nature of where we're

730
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:29,829
at and that's also why banking is what

731
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:33,869
it is as well so these are just hurdles

732
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:40,719
and they'll make it stronger I guess

733
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:43,210
more questions I own a building and I'm

734
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,398
having great difficult I'm having great

735
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,190
difficulty in refinancing the building

736
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:50,230
because originally the building didn't

737
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:54,940
have anything that had to do with

738
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:57,579
cannabis now it does and so what's your

739
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,710
suggestion on how to finance the

740
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:02,170
building without going too hard money

741
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:08,710
lenders who charge you an arm and a leg

742
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:10,780
and watch your leg as well I can I can

743
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:15,190
speak a bit to that I I had a client in

744
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:16,980
an identical circumstance what she's

745
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,179
talking about is essentially theirs

746
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,010
because the banking industry is

747
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:23,588
regulated federally they have

748
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:26,950
essentially told banks that if they

749
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:32,759
financed directly finance operations

750
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:36,579
that house cannabis industry companies

751
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:41,140
they can lose their licensure under the

752
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:42,369
federal banking regulations so you know

753
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,368
you're not you're not gonna get

754
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:48,390
financing from US bank or Chase or just

755
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:51,490
so completely put that out of your head

756
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:54,569
there you're in a tie I won't lie to you

757
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:58,598
you're in a tough situation outside of

758
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:01,599
self financing hard money lenders or

759
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,760
putting up sufficient allowed but even

760
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,809
then even if you had sufficient

761
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:12,310
collateral you simply can't get

762
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:15,309
financing from a mainstream bank there

763
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:18,130
are well there there was for a while

764
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:20,170
what Merchants Bank and Bank was doing

765
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,180
it but they weren't and for many years

766
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:25,300
now they did it for a little while but

767
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:29,079
there's no banks as far as I know in

768
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:32,200
Oregon that will do what you need to

769
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:36,279
have done what do you do you yeah so

770
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:37,169
private financing I can jump yes so up

771
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,619
in Canada

772
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:43,139
we have a couple reads so real estate

773
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:47,130
investment trusts that focus on cannabis

774
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:49,108
real estate vehicles like that there

775
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,510
ones here but obviously you can't do

776
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:55,230
that because they are they state

777
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:58,079
operated their state operated or they

778
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:02,190
private no other private okay but they

779
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,019
they lend against real estate but that's

780
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,579
essentially what he's describing what

781
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:07,768
you're describing is hard money lending

782
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:09,869
right you know and really that is your

783
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:11,699
option and that's one of the reasons why

784
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:14,760
those rates are so high because they

785
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:18,768
know they're the only option yeah so

786
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:22,890
I've met with Canadian companies as well

787
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:25,649
according me but from what I understand

788
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:29,219
from what you said that that's something

789
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:30,750
that I shouldn't even touch I didn't say

790
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,189
that and especially under these

791
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,219
circumstances I think you would be

792
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:38,970
that's one potential Avenue for you

793
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:47,268
because you don't own a well let me take

794
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:47,268
the fact are you okay shopping center

795
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:55,379
yes but you need refinancing of a

796
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:58,859
company that is not a license holders is

797
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,690
real estate just real estate so ya know

798
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:02,818
if she's taking if she's taking money

799
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,048
from the Canadians for real estate you

800
00:38:02,818 --> 00:38:06,538
can absolutely do that

801
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:08,909
that's that's what I need to do that you

802
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:10,799
can absolutely jack in fact that yes

803
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:14,129
that's one of the great things that I do

804
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:16,500
want to tell everyone is you can get

805
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,440
break up you can break up your company's

806
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,630
a bit and get foreign investment by

807
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,139
saying allowing them to buy the real

808
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:27,568
estate and then you pay them uh your

809
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:29,670
lease it's just a sale lease pal right

810
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:33,329
exactly exactly yeah you have a hard

811
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:35,099
asset that it US lending institutions

812
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:37,619
have a tough time with but not Canadian

813
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,630
ones but that's that is permitted you

814
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,960
you absolutely can do that I think in

815
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,910
the end besides finding investors who

816
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,869
are interested in your businesses please

817
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:52,048
please please consult with lawyers

818
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:53,999
I'm not saying me I mean I'd be happy to

819
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:57,599
speak with you but talk to a lawyer

820
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:59,399
retain a lawyer because these are very

821
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,190
technical rules that you could easily

822
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,329
violate without ever realizing it and

823
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:09,420
the penalties are relatively severe I

824
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:11,068
think one more in the event that someone

825
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,298
did get an investor let's say we have

826
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:14,009
the company and you're getting invested

827
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:15,239
into where's the money going to go into

828
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:17,608
if we're having these banking issues

829
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:18,960
already where we're gonna be able to get

830
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:23,608
your money in to be able to work it with

831
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,858
the company that we are built so so why

832
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:27,650
one of the opportunities that we're

833
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:32,369
looking at is a vertically integrated

834
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:35,608
operation in California and so I asked

835
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:37,440
them the exact same question and you

836
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:39,808
know like Ted said you can't go to Bank

837
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,179
of America or Chase or Wells Fargo but

838
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:44,819
what they said that they they do they've

839
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:47,759
been doing business for the last eight

840
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:50,400
months with a credit union in California

841
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:53,150
and they they said that the this credit

842
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,789
union has a don't-ask-don't-tell policy

843
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:59,729
and that's and that's what it seems to

844
00:39:56,789 --> 00:40:01,440
be working for them so so generally it's

845
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:04,228
a lot tougher to get financing from a

846
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,150
bank but you can play around and you

847
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:07,798
need some redundancy like have multiple

848
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,999
bank accounts I think that's how most

849
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:10,798
most of us do it

850
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:17,218
you get shut down you got to have

851
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:20,309
another one yeah yeah and I think credit

852
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:23,849
unions are a good option if you if you

853
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:28,769
can if you can get it but I think this

854
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:30,479
also suggests that it's everyone's

855
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:32,699
responsibility here to tell their

856
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:35,548
friends and everyone else to contact

857
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,618
there's us congressmen senators about

858
00:40:35,548 --> 00:40:39,599
changing the federal banking laws that

859
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:42,509
allow this to be operated like any other

860
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,740
regulated business because that's we're

861
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:48,429
paying the same taxes

862
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:50,049
even more of them yeah guys I think

863
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:52,079
that's it that's it that's our time

864
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:56,700
thank you guys so much hear it again

865
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,699
