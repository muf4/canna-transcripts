last seven years

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,359
one of the things i guess i was i should

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
have started with is saying

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,359
our whole panel is going to talk about

33
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:15,039
business development and expanding your

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,239
business in a multinational framework um

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
you know from either the us into europe

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,239
or if you're coming from colombia into

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,960
europe and the panelists that we have

38
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,359
here are all coming out of a different

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,359
unique perspective on an international

40
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,959
expansion one of the things i'd like to

41
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,879
mention about george here that just

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,679
introduced himself

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,679
he's been extracting

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,479

one of the leaders in the lavender

48
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,719
world so this is a man that has

49
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,959
extraction experience that far exceeds

50
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,519
cannabis experience so he's coming in

51
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,000
and has also gone from europe to america

52
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,759
so he's got a very uh unique perspective

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,680
on that the next person i want to

54

00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,759
about your questions if there's time at

107
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,798
audience questions

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,759
you've got a wealth of information up

109
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,438
here

110
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,318
we're all looking to jump into this

111
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,639
european market and excited about it and

112
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,839
you've got experts up here who've done

113
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,559
this work

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
so

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
uh

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
george

117
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,878
how do you see the europe european

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,878
market evolving over the next five years

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,238
that's very interesting question uh

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
european market is very dynamic

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,758
there are so many countries involved in

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,280
trading and this topic over here is

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,879
about strategies global strategies and

124
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,879
environment which is very very uh

125
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,439
interesting overview on

126
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,639
what really gonna happen in five years

127
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,360
so diversity in um

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,240
in europe we first need to know our

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
class

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,439
so

131
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,439
knowing what people want we can put

132
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,600
together uh every every product they

133
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,680
need but how i see that market um i see

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
big pharma getting into it there is no

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,759
limitation for big pharma in europe like

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,439
united states we have some restrictions

137
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
but in europe big pharma is going to

138
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,519
come big way as well

139
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,198
uh how big pharma thinks about this

140
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,680
industry is

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,680
pure ingredients isolated

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,079
ingredients that they could put some

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,240
drugs around it and

144
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,319
and provide that to the medical market

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,038
very straightforward

146
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,120
and

147
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,800
how everybody else can survive around

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
that so there is going to be another

149
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,319
market which people are going to be

150
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
after that's pretty much the boutique

151
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,000
market uh what we're doing right now

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,360
growing uh nice trains getting uh pure

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
extracts and

154
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
the world pure is going to be very

155
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
important here in the next

156
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,399
market development

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,639
we

158
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,279
really going to be focused on real

159
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,000
[Music]

160
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,599
ecologically grown

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
ingredients and extracted in the least

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
hazardous way with at least harmful

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,319
solvents and delivered in the most

164
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,478
natural important form to the customer

165
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,960
and it's going to be a boutique real

166
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,879
boutique market that's going to overcome

167
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,399
everything that the big farmer is going

168
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,399
to be pushing also to the market and

169
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,519
keeping the

170
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,679
um

171
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,959
also we have to know very well

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
the

173
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,359
laws in each country and be able to make

174
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,160
it here global to make it real global

175
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
now example with german market so we're

176
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
hoping extraction is going to be

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
legal next year unfortunately it's going

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,400
to be pushed back so we have to do that

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
way to the extraction uh when we know

180
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,399
that our markets in germany we have to

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,680
do the extraction somewhere that um

182
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,279
that's possible for example czech

183
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,160
republic or

184
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,599
somewhere else then while we grow

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
of course

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,919
we should grow good strains with that do

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,120
not cost prohibitive so we can pick up

188
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,079
pretty much

189
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,840
a global international uh european

190
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,680
business that

191
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,279
by knowing our customer deliver the best

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,360
products and we have to have this

193
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,478
customer returning back so in five years

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,560
we really have to

195
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,918
be able to deliver the best

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,879
organic natural products for the

197
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,038
customer in a most natural way

198
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,279
i think you're right about that the

199
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,360
um sort of prevailing opinion that i've

200
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,758
heard since you know coming here for the

201
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
last couple of days has been

202
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,960
that

203
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,199
europeans are already connoisseurs of

204
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,079
cannabis and so that i mean think about

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,240
the wine connoisseur um they they have

206
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,598
they want the pinot or they want the

207
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,280
sauvignon blanc or whatever it is

208
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,879
everyone has their different flavor that

209
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,038
they like and so then your boutique

210
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,639
market comment is that

211
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,240
people are going to want what they want

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
and the market needs to provide it for

213
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
them in a in a quality way

214
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,800
with flavor um

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,639
and the effects that they want so it

216
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,199
isn't just a medical experience it's

217
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,960
going to become uh you know this taste

218
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
maker thing but the european market's

219
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,719
different than america in the sense that

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
you know i heard everyone talking today

221
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,599
about the um

222
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,439
the love of hash in this market right

223
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,598
and so you're talking about concentrates

224
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,038
and the fact that you gotta go where you

225
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,279
can operate

226
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,038
actually i'm looking at uh the cannabis

227
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,598
particularly this market as gourmet

228
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,439
market you can like your extraction

229
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,759
vessel is like a pressure cooker you can

230
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,800
cook your own recipes you can take over

231
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,439
like you can offer people uh flavors

232
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,439
experience and that's how you get that

233
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,120
market followed right

234
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,959
ali i don't know if any of you guys know

235
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
we're here when ali was on the

236
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,758
moderating panel and he said

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,720
grapes are a commodity but wine is a

238
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,200
product but cannabis is unique because

239
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,158
it's both it's a commodity and

240
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,680
a cpg product so it's an interesting

241
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,200
concept

242
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,799
george terry

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
talk to us about what some of the

244
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,759
lessons are that you've learned you've

245
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,159
said you've been in hundreds of

246
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,360
facilities big ones small ones across

247
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,879
the globe

248
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,159
what are some of the lessons that you've

249
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,320
learned

250
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,519
about startup strategies

251
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,839
and if you can dovetail on what george

252
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,320
here said um in terms of knowing that in

253
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,480
five years we expect the cannabis market

254
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,160
to be one of uh sort of gourmet

255
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,600
connoisseur so what are some of the

256
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,439
things that you could give people that

257
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
are wanting to start up here well i

258
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
agree about the regulations you've got

259
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,559
to know your regulations and and not

260
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,639
just what you guessed or what you think

261
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,479
but but have them run

262
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,199
if you need to get a consultant

263
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,440
uh regulations change at the whim of the

264
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,120
local regulators sometimes they'll go in

265
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
one direction and they'll switch to

266
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
another direction even testing

267
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,159
regulations as far as the product goes

268
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,719
and um

269
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,838
and a mandate that might be local

270
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,320
federal

271
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,440
or even country wide

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,278
so

273
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
that you know is something that's big

274
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,759
also too you know

275
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,720
what i find is

276
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,159
you know i told the guys prior to this

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,360
there's two types of people i find in

278
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,879
the cannabis industry those that

279
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,879
that that have been fooled and those

280
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,039
that are about to be fooled okay

281
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,480
and the reason i say that is because

282
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,639
when people come into the cannabis

283
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,399
industry they automatically assume

284
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,278
that it's not as a professional and it

285
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,039
is

286
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,600
as an industry as it is

287
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,838
um and they think that they can

288
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,360
sell snake oil you know hey you know i'm

289
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
going to try to bring this product in it

290
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,039
might it might work

291
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,239
in a in another area like food or it

292
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,599
might work

293
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,360
and um

294
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,519
and then the medical world but it's not

295
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,480
really working in the cannabis world so

296
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,759
even in my experience of my product um

297
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,759
we do a radiator that's on site

298
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,519
it's a direct replacement for gamma you

299
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,480
know there's other technologies that are

300
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,959
out there and 50 of my

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,360
of my customer base is is people that

302
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,119
have tried other failed technologies and

303
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,839
we give them a card and we say we'll

304
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,278
hear from you in a couple months

305
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,440
you know we always hear back from them

306
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,000
so check out your vendors check out your

307
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,120
uh your technologies talk to people get

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,120
references

309
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,039
um you know because once you go in and

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,000
you invest in the technology

311
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,439
um and whether that's a you know a

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,839
technology that's going to get you

313
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
through cultivation or growth or veg or

314
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,200
anything like that

315
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,360
you got to make sure that uh or lighting

316
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,079
solution you don't talk to people that

317
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,320
are in your same boat you know they're

318
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,799
either in a startup or when they started

319
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,519
what lessons did they find out you know

320
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,399
did they learn um

321
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,639
early on about that product what did it

322
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,919
impact on their crop i've had customers

323
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,078
that they've gone out with other

324
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,078
technologies on the cultivation side on

325
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,559
you know decontamination it's turned all

326
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,838
their product yellow or dried it up or

327
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,639
turned uh

328
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,160
it turned it all soft and squishy

329
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,519
they ruined their whole crop five

330
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,199
hundred thousand dollars with the

331
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,639
product gone

332
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
or they have to turn it to extract and

333
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,360
get twenty cents on the dollar

334
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,600
had they talked to other people

335
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,720
you know other other people or you know

336
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
did a little bit of research they're

337
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
going to save themselves a lot of time

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,320
and money

339
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,399
so

340
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
you know that's that's my big thing is

341
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,919
just know your

342
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,599
you know know your competitors be

343
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,838
friendly with your competitors friendly

344
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
competition is fine

345
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,480
but be careful

346
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,479
and check it out

347
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
we're all competitors we consider

348
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
ourselves colleagues

349
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,480
and we help each other we

350
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,879
call each other and i think

351
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
developing a network where you can be

352
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,679
friendly with the people who are doing

353
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,039
exactly what you're doing i think that's

354
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,319
really smart um in a perfect world i

355
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,240
hate to hear that people have to

356
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
irradiate their flower like in a perfect

357
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,959
world they should be able to grow clean

358
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,799
cannabis and not need to irradiate it um

359
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,479
but the regulations are so stringent

360
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,399
that sometimes i guess that's required

361
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,000
huh yeah it's required because people

362
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,639
die

363
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,480
so you know there's there's the the

364
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
market that says oh it should be organic

365
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,039
and but you know what guys i've got

366
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,879
people and and i can name

367
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,639
multiple people where they come in and

368
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,799
we go and we talk to them they say i

369
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,399
don't need your machine i don't have any

370
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,958
problem older mildew i don't have any

371
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,879
aspergillus and we say here's a card and

372
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,199
six months later they call us

373
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,399
i need it now i've got stuff on the i

374
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,480
don't know where it came because what

375
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,360
happens is the season changes moisture

376
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,120
comes in and it's everywhere so you know

377
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
people you know i'm dealing with a

378
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,399
situation now in one of the states they

379
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,759
say oh you know

380
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
you know everything should be clean it

381
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,679
should be organic

382
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680
it's it's not the real world it's i mean

383
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,559
even stuff that you buy that's food

384
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,879
based

385
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,799
people get sick from organic food too

386
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,278
you know there's pathogens that might be

387
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,919
there or whatever no matter what in this

388
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,078
world we're full of germs

389
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,559
and and it's it's at the end it's do you

390
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,078
want to be able to address those germs

391
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,838
and it's nice when you're not when you

392
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,198
don't have to but you always need a

393
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
backup plan that's going to be able to

394
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,679
address that because some people

395
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,919
cannot accept those type of pathogens in

396
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,000
their bodies it will kill them

397
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,879
yeah people i always say bad news does

398
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,799
not get better with time and some people

399
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,519
don't want to hear the bad news that

400
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,278
their weed isn't great

401
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,759
so just assume that maybe you'll have

402
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,879
one bad crop and be prepared we're going

403
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,720
to switch to darren we're going to

404
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,399
switch gears a little bit here

405
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
um because one of the things that we're

406
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,639
talking about is an emerging market so

407
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,160
george talked about the fact that you

408
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,919
know what's going to happen in the next

409
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,919
five years is it's going to evolve into

410
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,759
this boutique market right but we're at

411
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,599
right now everybody's chomping at the

412
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,198
bit to get started because we're with

413
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,360
medical in europe um we're all patient

414
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,559
patiently waiting for germany to go

415
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
wreck

416
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,119
um

417
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,360
i want to know darren do you think

418
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,440
there's and what are your thoughts on

419
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,639
having a first mover advantage is it an

420
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,480
advantage

421
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,320
getting to market first that's a great

422
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,560
question jamie and i think

423
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
i think on paper uh being early to

424
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,039
market shows a lot of advantages to any

425
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,320
business i mean it's immediate market

426
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,919
share uh it's quick brand recognition

427
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,399
but as as we've seen in the canadian

428
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,159
market over the last four plus years a

429
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,159
lot of the first to market actually

430
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,679
faltered in many ways and it proved to

431
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,679
be very costly

432
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,599
both from brand recognition if they

433
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,838
didn't have deep pockets

434
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,600
or other capital

435
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,519
they went out of business

436
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,360
so quite frankly i think i think the

437
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,799
best approach is become an expert in

438
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,720
your backyard first

439
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,039
before you start exploring playing

440
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,040
playing with your neighbors okay do a

441
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,120
lot of research if you're ready to go to

442
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,078
the next market on an international

443
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
level

444
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,479
i think it's extremely important to do

445
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,079
your research

446
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
whether that's through focus groups

447
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,599
consultants uh utilizing your network to

448
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,000
to learn and what george said with learn

449
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,680
learn the policies learn the regulations

450
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,480
uh before you jump into that market

451
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,399
because as as we've seen just this week

452
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,000
every country is very very different on

453
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
their expectation and what the rules and

454
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,399
regulations are

455
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,879
so i think to answer your question jamie

456
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,198
as long as you're using your brains and

457
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,120
your experience before speed and you're

458
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,359
ready to you have the proper game plan

459
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
before you actually go to that next

460
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,639
market

461
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,958
i don't see it being advantageous unless

462
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,079
you're you're truly prepared to tackle

463
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,239
that market

464
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,120
well let's piggyback on that a little

465
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,639
bit

466
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,879
let's say that you're

467
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,639
you've got like as an example with

468
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,639
george here having 25 years of

469
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,720
extraction experience not necessarily

470
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,198
cannabis but now he has cannabis

471
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,399
experience you say rely on your ex your

472
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,758
business expertise because i think

473
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,519
there's people in this room and i've met

474
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,600
people at this conference

475
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,278
that are intrigued about the industry

476
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
they have no experience in their

477
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,559
backyard because this is their backyard

478
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,720
and it doesn't exist yet so how do they

479
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,879
go use their brains

480
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,278
and go get themselves prepared so are

481
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,439
you suggesting perhaps that they wait to

482
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,120
enter or are you suggesting that there's

483
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,120
a way for them to do that due diligence

484
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,839
to get prepared i think going back to

485
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,679
the comment on on utilizing uh whether

486
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,120
it's a consulting firm or focus groups

487
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,519
as i mentioned

488
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,278
educate yourself and get yourself ready

489
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,720
i'm not saying don't necessarily enter

490
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,639
that market

491
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,560
just just be prepared to become an

492
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,278
expert in that market as you dive into

493
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,599
it

494
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,599
from experience but with cookie jar we

495
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,439
actually utilized consultants before we

496
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,759
would enter our own backyard

497
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,240
to understand that the market and if if

498
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,838
we entered the market in 2018 when it

499
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,000
became federally legal

500
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,359
uh i think we would have fallen flat on

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,078
our face to be quite honest because the

502
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,958
timing wasn't right for us um

503
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,038
as we as we expanded in the canadian

504
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
market became an expert then we focused

505
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,558
on the u.s market

506
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,640
and where we are today is now we're

507
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,798
trying to to explore the european market

508
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,520
so just doing your due diligence

509
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,679
learning being educating yourself

510
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,679
educating your team and then educating

511
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
the market as you're ready to uh

512
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,720
enter that that space

513
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,240
and what's like what george terry said

514
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,038
know your regs be prepared be careful

515
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,319
um

516
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:51,440
jessica

517
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,000
um

518
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,080
you have i think what 12 years of

519
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,279
experience in the cannabis industry uh

520
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,279
pioneer

521
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,279
uh one of the if not the first company

522
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,599
to go public on the nasdaq like we're

523
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,759
we're all sitting with greatness here

524
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,558
you should all be really proud of icbc

525
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,240
for

526
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,279
getting her to get on an airplane i'm

527
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,440
excited to be on this panel with you

528
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,440
um

529
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,320
what are some of the foundational

530
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,080
strategies with all of that experience

531
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,000
talking to this room what are some of

532
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,798
the foundational strategies that you

533
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,839
could

534
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,798
um give us little nuggets of information

535
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,959
um to help people be prepared as they

536
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,759
decide if they do want to jump into this

537
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,759
emerging market

538
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
thank you for that and i i do have to

539
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,240
say icbc

540
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,839
whoever is listening having jamie as the

541
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,839
moderator was a nice big draw

542
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,679
so so with that let's say you are going

543
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,359
to

544
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,000
jump in to a new emerging market so

545
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,000
back to the basics right focus on

546
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,759
foundational items i like to think of

547
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
them as the three ps

548
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,640
people products process

549
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,720
hire the right people put them in the

550
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,120
right seats on the bus

551
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,880
products this is an interesting one and

552
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,839
maybe a little bit of a

553
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,840
hey

554
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,678
a tip from the future

555
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,839
for all of us who come from the future

556
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,480
who've been in this for over a decade

557
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,399
one of the biggest mistakes that we see

558
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,440
early businesses do is they try to

559
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,440
either grow too many strains or carry

560
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,640
too many products in their retail

561
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,759
location and so when you're starting out

562
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
in business

563
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,798
really focusing focusing on which

564
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,759
products am i going to carry and or

565
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,000
produce

566
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,240
and which ones can i do well and at a

567
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
price point that makes sense

568
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
and then third and i would say arguably

569
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,120
the most important is process setting up

570
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,160
your processes ahead of time

571
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,759
focusing on compliance and selecting

572
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,279
software technology that's going to

573
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,919
support that compliance because

574
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,158
compliance is table stakes

575
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,840
you can't literally you cannot remain in

576
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,520
business without it because you won't

577
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:10,639
keep your license and selecting a vendor

578
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:13,359
software technology that can scale with

579
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,679
you and grow as you grow so that you are

580
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,158
not taking on something that's too big

581
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,679
when you start but that you're also not

582
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,120
starting with something that's so

583
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,440
lightweight

584
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,279
that you have to abandon it and pay to

585
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,159
reinstall over and over through the

586
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,079
years so those are my tips

587
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,039
that's good advice i think

588
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,079
you know i came out of real estate and

589
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,158
i experienced that we bought a cheap

590
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,000
property management software and thought

591
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
oh this will get us through and then we

592
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,798
grew

593
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,599
and then we had to actually integrate

594
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,319
all that data into a new software and it

595
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,399
was way more expensive had we just

596
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,519
bought the expensive one the first

597
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
first time

598
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,879
like if you don't have time to do it

599
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,679
right the first time you're gonna find

600
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,000
time to do it again and clean it up so i

601
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,759
think that was really good advice um and

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,519
then i have a girlfriend who's a ceo

603
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,400
coach and she always says

604
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,319
write butts in the right seats uh you

605
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,640
gotta hire the right people

606
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,439
um so we had a couple of questions from

607
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,280
the audience um prior on the hoover app

608
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,600
and we're gonna jump into those

609
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,599
and then we're going to open the

610
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,119
panel up for questions from the audience

611
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,480
so the first question we got was

612
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,959
somebody who

613
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,919
um said that they're curious about the

614
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,440
multi-state operators that are operating

615
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,559
the big companies that are in the us

616
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,759
right now

617
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,000
what was our opinion about them trying

618
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,759
to come into the european market

619
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,679
and so george would you take that first

620
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,119
well that's real danger to the smoke

621
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,679
companies of course i can give an

622
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,519
example with arizona on the market so

623
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,120
arizona is very unique where you want to

624
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,279
market it's it has

625
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,239
licenses which are drawn by lottery so

626
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,759
you you have like 160 licenses and no

627
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,359
more than that is the case in the next

628
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:01,200
couple years

629
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:03,839
and you have let's say 35 big companies

630
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,960
in there 35 brands which are local but

631
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,639
they are about 5 000 california vape

632
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,120
brands and

633
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,679
at least 10 of them are huge

634
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,000
so them getting into the arizona space

635
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,000
that's gonna wipe out everybody else and

636
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,759
that's the situation here too we have to

637
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,519
be conscious about what exactly uh comes

638
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,519
to this market and be prepared to it

639
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,720
are really two ways to

640
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,960
uh the successful strategy in this way

641
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,120
like one way is like the books my

642
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,840
business book says first

643
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,119
learn who's doing it and copy him but

644
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,678
doing it better

645
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,639
or the second is see what your customers

646
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,759
want

647
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,360
and

648
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,359
evaluate your market

649
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,639
medical metrics but not how much you

650
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,678
want to spend

651
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
how much

652
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,880
your market is

653
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,440
and then build your strategy from the

654
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,159
back up and then divided the numbers by

655
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,600
two for sales and

656
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,280
multiply your numbers that you're gonna

657
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,558
spend then you're gonna get probably the

658
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,879
right numbers

659
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,000
and that's how you you prepare yourself

660
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
for a fight

661
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and uh

662
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,798
the most successful fight is how many

663
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,038
customers gonna buy from you every day

664
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,200
yeah i always say the commodity in

665
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,839
cannabis is the shelf that's what we're

666
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,679
fighting for is shelf space ultimately

667
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,119
that end product ends up on a shelf in a

668
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,120
store somewhere

669
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,759
and what i always tell people that ask

670
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,158
me to consult with them is

671
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,919
you have to start with the shelf

672
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,360
um because lots of people are like oh

673
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,799
i'm gonna go grow eat it's gonna be so

674
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,558
much fun or i'm gonna make a product

675
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,079
it's going to be so great and then they

676
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,519
have a great weed or they have a great

677
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,278
product and then they're like now what

678
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,278
they got to go sell it

679
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,720
you really want to have those orders

680
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,640
that goes to jessica's point you don't

681
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,319
want to grow 15 strains what's the

682
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
strains that people want or what's the

683
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,399
niche that's missing in the market and

684
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,000
so you've got to go fill that niche you

685
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,360
got to start with your shelf in mind

686
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,519
exactly but jessica can you elaborate on

687
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,599
george's point because you've got the 12

688
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,879
years of experience in the united states

689
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,399
market so

690
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,799
if people like george believe that it's

691
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,880
a danger to the small operator

692
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,558
and there's probably truth to that uh

693
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,480
we're watching it in different states or

694
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,839
managing it differently what are some of

695
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,679
the things that we could do in europe

696
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,839
here to protect that small operator

697
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,919
i think the only

698
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,798
long-term viable answer to that is

699
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,759
really regulatory or legislative in some

700
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,639
way and and we certainly see this in

701
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,240
some u.s states where the states have

702
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
looked at other states and they've said

703
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,720
you know we're going to make sure that

704
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,240
our licenses are awarded to residents of

705
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,798
the state and so there's a residency

706
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,960
requirement to gain the license

707
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,558
often those residents and resident

708
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,278
businesses will still partner with a

709
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:54,000
multi-state operator larger entity from

710
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,240
another state but you're still ensuring

711
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,919
some local business and some local

712
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,079
ownership and certainly for our

713
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
multi-country clients

714
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,119
of course

715
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,079
canada having quite a nice advantage

716
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,558
being the first g7 country to fully

717
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,639
federally legalize we do see a lot of

718
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,960
multi-country operators operating out of

719
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,200
canada that are beginning to get these

720
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,759
toehold licenses in different markets

721
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,759
and in colombia latin america with the

722
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,319
intention to hopefully export to europe

723
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,359
and then european licenses to anchor

724
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,038
that

725
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,119
i do think

726
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,640
in addition to the countries wanting to

727
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,239
enable the

728
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,600
economic benefits of putting those

729
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,720
licenses requiring them to be held by

730
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,879
local residents i also think there's a

731
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,720
benefit that's not talked about for the

732
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,760
multi-country operators so even when

733
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,480
it's not required there is a benefit to

734
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,558
partner with local businesses local

735
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
residents who know the market who know

736
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,440
the end consumer and who know the

737
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,960
nuances there

738
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,880
yeah for sure you need boots on the

739
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,919
ground that intimate knowledge of the

740
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,159
market which actually ties really nicely

741
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,080
into the second question that came from

742
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,200
the audience on hoova it was a person

743
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,960
that said

744
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,278
uh they provide climatization materials

745
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,880
to both indoor and outdoor growers and

746
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,759
they wanted to know

747
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,760
um

748
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,679
well i'm just going to summarize the

749
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,879
question by saying they're feeling very

750
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,080
impatient

751
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,960
because they have to wait because

752
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,918
there's

753
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,480
we're not ready yet so what can people

754
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,400
who are anxious to get here what can

755
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,319
they do while they're waiting some of

756
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,278
the estimates have been

757
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,119
um most of them and let me take a poll

758
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,359
here how many of you think that it's

759
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:40,798
going to be mid 2024 before we're going

760
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,798
to see actual adult use sales in germany

761
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,679
okay

762
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,559
quite a number of you how many of you

763
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,559
think it'll be sooner

764
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,240
a few people how many of you think it'll

765
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:55,038
be 20 25 because they're just going to

766
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,759
mess it all up and okay so a few of you

767
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,119
well there's a great example of we don't

768
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,798
know

769
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,639
it could be next year could be the year

770
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,400
after could be there after that

771
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,400
and in the meantime we've got all these

772
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,759
people excited to get in the market

773
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,600
what can people do in the meantime

774
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,720
they're waiting go for it darren yeah i

775
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,480
think uh

776
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,038
i don't know too many governments that

777
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,798
are uh make decisions very quickly and

778
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,879
if they do it's not always the right the

779
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,319
right decision to go down the right path

780
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,240
i think it's i think it's extremely

781
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,398
important to make sure you you stay as

782
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,919
close as you can with the government uh

783
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,918
to understand what those rules and

784
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,600
regulations are to make sure that you're

785
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,679
you're set up for success when they when

786
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,839
they do make that decision

787
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,278
i think a lot of people talk about

788
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,519
educating the industry in a lot of

789
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,558
different facets i think it's just as

790
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,639
important to educate the government on

791
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,000
what we feel is the proper way of doing

792
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,759
things

793
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,278
i think it's extremely important to look

794
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,879
at some of the countries that have

795
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,599
legalized federally

796
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,080
um on what's gone well what hasn't gone

797
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,158
well how can we learn from this and when

798
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,960
when that particular market's ready to

799
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,200
go

800
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,679
they won't make the same mistakes

801
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,600
i think the first key step is on

802
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
actually legalizing it but if we can

803
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,038
educate

804
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,000
our governments on on the best way to do

805
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:14,240
it um i think that'll help expedite the

806
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,880
process

807
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,278
yeah and um just piggybacking on

808
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,919
what darren said uh

809
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,759
regulators are there for public safety

810
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,080
and if they're there to make sure the

811
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,119
public is is protected whether it's for

812
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,199
a safety

813
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,079
reason or just so that they don't get

814
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,200
scammed or they're not poisoned right so

815
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,158
um

816
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,919
but regulators are relying on you

817
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,278
like what he was saying in order to give

818
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,960
them the right information remember

819
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,038
these are people that come in they might

820
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,558
not necessarily be from the industry

821
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,519
themselves and they are looking for hard

822
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,278
facts

823
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,798
they're not looking for a conjecture or

824
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,119
they're not looking for what you you

825
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,720
know what your your opinion is but if

826
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,199
you're able to provide these regulators

827
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,519
with hard facts you're able to help

828
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,519
shape the regulations in your area and

829
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,119
i've seen that a lot where people go

830
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,200
into these regulators i sit with a lot

831
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,158
of state regulators a lot

832
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,880
and

833
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,360
and the information that they gather

834
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,760
from different sources helps them shape

835
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,599
the regulations for either that state

836
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,519
uh whether it's a federal thing or a

837
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,278
country or whatever so you know be as

838
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,798
open and honest with your regulators

839
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,480
don't try to know

840
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,798
give them the hard fact and don't give

841
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,399
me your opinion give them facts so that

842
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,359
they can draw their own opinions on what

843
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,239
they think

844
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,959
will help them with public safety

845
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,798
i agree raise your hand if you are in

846
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,079
contact with

847
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,960
a local

848
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:42,639
state federal or

849
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,720
lund regulator

850
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,640
i just want to say thank you

851
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,600
because george is right it is going to

852
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,759
require us educating the lawmakers

853
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,839
because they don't know

854
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,640
you know what again another real estate

855
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,639
example is you know you buy a house you

856
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,080
get an inspector well if the inspector

857
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,679
was a former electrician they're going

858
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,199
to come in and find all the electrical

859
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,720
problems and they don't know about

860
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,038
plumbing right well all these

861
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,480
legislators came out of somewhere

862
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,798
and they know you know they're one-trick

863
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,960
ponies well none of them have come out

864
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,639
of cannabis because it's brand new so

865
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,278
it's on us

866
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,159
to go to them and help them understand

867
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,398
uh what what needs to happen one of the

868
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,278
things i can tell you is from you know

869
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,678
the standpoint of international cannabis

870
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,640
business development strategies

871
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,200
um

872
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,399
education of regulators is a

873
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,640
huge

874
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,639
component of a strategy because uh you

875
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,440
can take their order what do they want

876
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,440
they want to keep the consumer safe

877
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,240
they want to keep the constituents happy

878
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,759
with them they want to raise tax revenue

879
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,079
they have all of these different

880
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,640
competing agendas what we need to help

881
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,839
them understand is how can they craft a

882
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,000
win-win

883
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,918
so one of the examples is

884
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,240
earlier we we talked about how there's

885
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,960
this big appetite for hash in europe

886
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,839
well is hash even in the agenda right

887
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,278
now legislators always approach things

888
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,959
with fear as their motivator oh we got

889
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,319
to keep people safe we have to make sure

890
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,919
we're going to limit this we're going to

891
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,119
limit that we're going to tax it we're

892
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,278
going to make sure there's not enough

893
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,359
licenses but whitney just gave a

894
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,200
presentation and talked about what the

895
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,839
demand is going to be

896
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,960
in germany when it goes wreck and i'm

897
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,319
going to tell you right now they're not

898
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,798
going to meet it they're going to sell

899
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,960
out immediately how do we

900
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,879
teach our legislators to learn from

901
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,759
what's happened

902
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,320
in

903
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:42,319
the last what is it 22 years of cannabis

904
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,319
in america anyone want to take that

905
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,319
first it starts by organizing

906
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,879
so i'm going to put on my chair of uscc

907
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,918
hat right now the us cannabis council

908
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,039
and

909
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,960
really forming a trade association the

910
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,440
folks just before us

911
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,240
speaking on behalf of a

912
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,159
european-based trade organization

913
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,640
pooling your voice so that your

914
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,799
regulators are hearing one voice

915
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,720
really hiring some folks who are really

916
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:14,639
great at policy helping to write that

917
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,360
policy and then at the end of the day

918
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,880
the

919
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,918
public regulators care about three

920
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,480
things they care about public safety

921
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,519
product safety and patient or consumer

922
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,240
safety

923
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,399
and ensuring that you're speaking to the

924
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,000
things that they care about

925
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,398
how are we going to protect the public

926
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
how are we going to protect from illicit

927
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,079
sources how are we going to ensure that

928
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,240
the products are safe how are we going

929
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,759
to ensure that the patients and the

930
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,399
consumers can purchase safely yeah from

931
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,200
a biz dev standpoint you're out here

932
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:50,479
trying to develop business strategies to

933
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,640
get your products or your grow or raise

934
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,839
money or whatever it is you're doing at

935
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,440
your

936
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,639
corporate level

937
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,080
but none of that happens if your

938
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,360
business isn't going to be viable

939
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,000
because we don't have the right

940
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,398
legislation in place you guys this is a

941
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,960
very ripe opportunity because they

942
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,038
haven't written the regs yet so what i

943
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,798
would also say is please put in your

944
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,558
budgets money

945
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,200
for the people that are out there

946
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,918
lobbying because if you can help fund

947
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,080
them and start speaking with one voice

948
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,000
as an industry if we can start speaking

949
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,439
with one voice we will become more

950
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
powerful

951
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,720
um george i have a question for you so

952
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,038
you

953
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,440
right now you're based out of

954
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,679
where you know you're doing business

955
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,360
in arizona in arizona we have also

956
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,120
california oregon

957
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,798
colorado pennsylvania okay and so when

958
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,119
you see all the different regulations

959
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,639
that are at a state level

960
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,199
because we don't have any federal

961
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,640
legalization in the u.s and we're

962
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,640
starting to see the same thing happen

963
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,559
here in europe there's medical in

964
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,720
germany there's medical in italy there's

965
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:59,278
medical and friends but

966
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,839
no eu legislation

967
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,079
what would the advice be if you if you

968
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,398
could rub the genies bottle

969
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,918
and a legislator could pop out what

970
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,719
would the advice be that you would give

971
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,878
them

972
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,759
well maybe uis is at least five years

973
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,960
ahead in that legislation and um

974
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,639
they are

975
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,720
trade associations in the united states

976
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,079
they've been through all of this uh

977
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,439
they've been turned into senators

978
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,000
they've been talking to mayors they've

979
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,119
been talking to local authorities to

980
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,838
experts

981
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,760
and that system has been already

982
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,279
implemented especially california it's

983
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,079
all

984
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,079
it's it's a big

985
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,719
movement and stuff so

986
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,519
we have to connect those organizations

987
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:46,480
and european uh trade association is to

988
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,719
learn from all the success that was done

989
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,119
and how eventually

990
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,078
that was done in the united states

991
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,280
thank you

992
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,280
do we have any questions in the audience

993
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,010
[Music]

994
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,599

995
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,880

thank you

999
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,358
this is a pretty open-ended question i'm

1000
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,440
curious what perspectives you have on

1001
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,679
the development of an international

1002
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,800
cannabis market what benefits it might

1003
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,799
provide what risks it might contain

1004
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,039
and how you know how it ought to be

1005
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,000
phased in in a way that maximizes the

1006
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,440
benefits for a diverse and broad uh

1007
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,119
cannabis community

1008
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,358
can you clarify what you mean by an

1009
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,440
international cannabis market yeah so

1010
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,960
one in which countries can trade with

1011
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,639
one another we were just talking about

1012
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,079
the patchwork of regulations in the

1013
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,559
states and the differences between the

1014
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,400
countries so one that resembles trade

1015
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,759
for other commodities

1016
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,119
and you know when that might take effect

1017
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,480
well we talked about cannabis

1018
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,800
connoisseurs

1019
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,639
and i can't wait

1020
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,640
to go and buy the equivalent of what i'm

1021
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,000
able to do with coffee i say that all

1022
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,598
the time i would love to buy some

1023
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,838
moroccan hash

1024
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,880
at my local place right talking in a

1025
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,960
spanish haze get some moroccan hash

1026
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,160
that's right you bring some actual thai

1027
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
stick

1028
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,879
oh

1029
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,039
i hope i'm still alive when that happens

1030
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,240
and then derby poison for the next week

1031
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,480
when you want something a little

1032
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,039
different let's talk about it

1033
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,039
go to my house

1034
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,239
we have to manifest it as an

1035
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,000
organization here so everyone in this

1036
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,358
room just put that picture in your mind

1037
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,880
and then think about all that power we

1038
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,880
would have done

1039
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,679
can i say though on the on the pro side

1040
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,440
from an environmental perspective purely

1041
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,759
environmental perspective

1042
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,240
it would be great to grow cannabis where

1043
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,119
there's a lower cost for production than

1044
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,358
where

1045
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,039
much of it is grown today

1046
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,598
and also

1047
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:02,400
a lot has been invested

1048
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,039
in growing it in places that are maybe

1049
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,599
not the most natural warehouses in

1050
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,960
canada for example just saying

1051
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,240
it's weird

1052
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,880
and that's gonna that's going to

1053
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:17,679
prohibit regulation for a while

1054
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,280
and what even from a medicinal side too

1055
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,838
you know i might have somebody who's

1056
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,680
sitting in europe that there might be a

1057
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,119
medicine that's grown in the u.s or

1058
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,199
maybe in colombia or something that

1059
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,440
might be better for their condition but

1060
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,480
they can't get it because of regulation

1061
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,240
so i think a bigger global market will

1062
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,599
eventually help the patient to get the

1063
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,358
right medicine that they need in order

1064
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,640
to address whatever condition that they

1065
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,239
might be using

1066
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,400
yeah from my perspective i would love to

1067
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,719
have one manufacturing facility for bank

1068
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,079
chocolate and then just ship it

1069
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,319
all over the world

1070
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,400
and not have to have 50 different ones

1071
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,760
or you know one in canada i want to you

1072
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,519
know you get it

1073
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,000
it's inefficient

1074
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,358
and it makes companies less profitable

1075
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,480
bo what's up

1076
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,759
uh in some of my analysis of

1077
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,800
the

1078
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,000
the biggest markets economically are

1079
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,839
north america and in eu

1080
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,639
but from a consumer perspective the

1081
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,519
larger markets are in asia and africa

1082
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,759
and so

1083
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,480
what advice do you have any observations

1084
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,680
on

1085
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,880
on how to engage the asian and african

1086
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,118
markets

1087
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,720
um in addition to the u.s and north

1088
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,519
american markets

1089
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,199
you're way out of my expertise

1090
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,280
anyone here want to talk about asia

1091
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,199
absolutely so it's regulatory

1092
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,119
most of these areas right i mean in some

1093
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,199
of these places if you even say cbd or

1094
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,119
you say thc you're going to

1095
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,439
lock you up so

1096
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,760
those markets first they have to

1097
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,240
they have to understand the benefits of

1098
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,160
the cbd it took a while in the us you

1099
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,719
know of understanding what the actual

1100
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,199
benefits are medicinally and for even

1101
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,039
the recreational market once the culture

1102
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,960
accepts it and there's enough so it

1103
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,679
comes for education through education

1104
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,920
legislatures through things like with um

1105
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:04,159
jessica's dealing with with cam with a

1106
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,280
chamber of commerces then eventually

1107
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,000
they're going to go i mean in the

1108
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,519
timeline they're actually you know

1109
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,358
we're actually talking with some people

1110
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,679
in thailand right now

1111
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,719
which you know three years ago without

1112
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:16,078
hurt

1113
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,838
but some countries you're just not going

1114
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,839
to walk in and say you know hey guess

1115
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,920
what cannabis is here

1116
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,838
yeah right to the point

1117
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,838
i could just think that it

1118
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,239
for everywhere it's a good source of new

1119
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,239
revenue normally we which is monopoly

1120
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,078
money right we go oh this year it's the

1121
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,598
republicans we're gonna give it to the

1122
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,480
you know the military oh this year it's

1123
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,838
a democrats we're gonna give it to

1124
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,159
education it's the same dollar we just

1125
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,799
move it back and forth on the board

1126
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,639
but cannabis is bringing new dollars to

1127
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,720
the table and into the budget so i could

1128
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,118
see these emerging markets being really

1129
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,879
excited about having new dollars

1130
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,039
but that also leads to it we're up here

1131
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,240
over here hi up to your left oh it's

1132
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,679
hongayo

1133
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,519
that also leads to i mean a lot of these

1134
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,039
cultures and the way capitalism works

1135
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,039
all the time is people see the

1136
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,159
opportunity for new dollars and they

1137
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,279
don't really want to spread it around

1138
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,279
they want to see a way to create a

1139
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,280
monopoly for themselves to hold on to

1140
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,079
those new dollars especially in a lot of

1141
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,760
countries where there's a culture of

1142
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,760
corruption's a strong word but

1143
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,200
selfishness

1144
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,960
right so how do you create how do you

1145
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,279
get past that because you have to talk

1146
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,318
to umpteen different legislators who are

1147
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,079
their own

1148
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,159
kings of their own little fiefdoms well

1149
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,119
that's part of it i think um tom suber

1150
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,799
said on a panel yesterday and i thought

1151
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,880
he was spot on one of the things that we

1152
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,160
didn't get right in the u.s is we don't

1153
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,880
talk a lot in the u.s about the actual

1154
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,279
medical benefits of cannabis that it's

1155
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,720
medicine it's killing cancer it's

1156
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,319
helping people with parkinson's and

1157
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,519
epilepsy and

1158
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,599
um

1159
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,599
we talk about tax dollars because

1160
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,838
america only cares about money but the

1161
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,079
reality is we can get people off opiates

1162
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,159
and i think that is something where when

1163
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,039
you start talking about medical benefits

1164
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,960
um

1165
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,800
you get people really excited and it

1166
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,440
isn't just a dollar conversation is

1167
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,160
there a question up there

1168
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,159
hi uh darren hickman from average global

1169
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,879
i'd like to springboard up something uh

1170
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,440
bo just mentioned talking about africa

1171
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,039
um and maybe jessica this might be for

1172
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,838
you in your capacity as the head of the

1173
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:16,159
u.s cannabis council one of their

1174
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:19,358
primary focuses is kind of social

1175
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,639
justice social equity

1176
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:22,400
do you see

1177
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,199
international cannabis strategy business

1178
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,400
development strategies um intermingled

1179
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,879
with the effort around social justice um

1180
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,200
and social equity for example possibly

1181
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,200
bridging because there's similar efforts

1182
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,159
in europe and germany was mentioned

1183
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,598
earlier

1184
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,719
in south america

1185
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,880
do you see

1186
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,639
possible strategies to bridge

1187
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,838
these initiatives to leverage the

1188
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,838
international opportunities

1189
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,000
well i certainly hope so

1190
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,559
i'm not sure that it's quite as

1191
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,239
sophisticated uh as your as your

1192
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,639
question and

1193
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,318
i really appreciate that push to think

1194
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,639
about things more globally and more

1195
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:04,480
holistically i'll say it

1196
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,799
one of the big initiatives as you know

1197
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,280
for the us cannabis council is social

1198
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,599
equity it's something that

1199
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,480
we have largely

1200
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,039
not gotten right to date in the u.s and

1201
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,280
so i think it starts with acknowledging

1202
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,318
hey we really haven't gotten this right

1203
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,119
yet

1204
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,599
and what can we

1205
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,318
do about it now how can we try to

1206
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,880
resolve that and i really appreciate the

1207
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,920
push to say hey is there a bridge to

1208
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,240
resolve it that's not only domestically

1209
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,800
within your country but are there some

1210
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,759
bridges to resolve it by by reaching

1211
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,318
across the lines and i had the the great

1212
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,280
pleasure to speak at parliament in the

1213
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,920
uk

1214
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,640
a few weeks ago as chair of uscc

1215
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,960
and was able to really highlight this

1216
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,838
major topic that hey

1217
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,760
as as you're thinking about your country

1218
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,119
your new legislation

1219
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,280
learn from the fact that this is

1220
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,280
something we really didn't get right

1221
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,800
and and how can we start to think about

1222
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,880
getting that right moving forward and

1223
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,200
i'm just going to maybe circle back to

1224
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,960
one point i made earlier too which is

1225
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,559
it doesn't have to be wholly owned

1226
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,400
licenses

1227
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,960
there can be really important

1228
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,559
partnerships that couple

1229
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,639
people that bring different strengths to

1230
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,719
the table as well yeah i think it's good

1231
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:27,078
nobody should be in prison for this plan

1232
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,078
ever we gotta get these people out

1233
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,110
and thank all of you for being involved

1234
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:41,739
and we'll see you later

1235
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:41,739
[Applause]

1236
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,759
you
