the panel that we have here today I'm

60
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,818
curious you guys are at the Forefront of

61
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,439
medical cannabis right now all around

62
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,419
the world we have so many different

63
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,818
countries here speaking with us today so

64
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,979
I'm curious to ask you guys what are

65
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:46,139
your what are the biggest breakthroughs

66
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,780
that you're seeing in medical cannabis

67
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,859
biotech advancements that are helping

68
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,860
shape Healthcare today

69
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,299
I can okay I I I'm really getting

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,360
excited about the fact that you know

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,980
I've most probably looked at over a

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,980
thousand clinical studies at the moment

73
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,780
and and just the range in which um

74
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,899
evidence is being generated at the

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,640
moment it it really for me is a new

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,700
chapter in this industry you know it was

77
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,339
always about sort of THC and CBD but

78
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,399
we're starting to to understand the

79
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,979
benefits of CBG of CBN of the asset

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,599
forms you know and and looking at

81
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,119
potentially mapping these different

82
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,939
cannabinoids out and seeing being really

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,680
quite targeted about where they could

84
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,419
have their main benefit and for me

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,219
that's that that is great because that's

86
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,759
in parallel with what farmer was doing

87
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:41,519
farmer was moving into a a phase called

88
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,219
personalized medicine recognizing that

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,780
not everybody responded the same way and

90
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,539
you needed to personalize the medicine

91
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,280
and I think in some ways this industry

92
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,739
could lead in that area about really

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,539
being able to personalize and what going

94
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,580
to have the best best impact on

95
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:58,979
different cohorts of consumers or

96
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,420
patients it's so true

97
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,560
um it's so fascinating the way how

98
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,780
cannabis helps with our homeostasis and

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,979
it helps with like body temperature so

100
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,719
there's so many different ways that it

101
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,579
can help and it's really exciting to see

102
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,500
like CBC that's the one I'm really

103
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,139
excited about as well would you guys

104
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,199
like to add to that yeah so I get

105
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:22,620
excited about the technological aspect

106
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,319
of growing cannabis I think like we've

107
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,180
seen let's say in the past decades we

108
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,279
went from you know growing it

109
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,780
agriculturally to really growing it

110
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:37,918
high-tech uh indoor growth what I am

111
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:41,039
very excited is about adding more uh

112
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:44,519
real-time sensorics real-time analytics

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,919
uh to the growth because uh you know

114
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,079
better than I do but it's not just the

115
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,000
cannabinoids but the ratios between them

116
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,120
so how to get things right how to get

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
things just the right for the the right

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,280
patient so uh yeah it's really really

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,399
cool to see also coming to this event to

120
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:06,918
see how high tech is entering like both

121
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:09,719
for how to input uh you know how to

122
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:13,500
modify the plant and also how to monitor

123
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,800
what's happening uh it's really exciting

124
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,800
and in one side when you look at it from

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,259
a manufacturer's standpoint in one way

126
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,960
we're trying to make products for today

127
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,879
products that can be sold

128
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:31,620
um you know products that are most in

129
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:34,439
most cases generic uh in sense so if you

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,840
have your magisterial prep 1010 as an

131
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,519
example you know this is not something

132
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,478
where you're going to be have some IP

133
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,879
protection and something interesting

134
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,978
when when you make products even if

135
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,439
you're making them for a a marketable

136
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,599
product you get a lot of calls from

137
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,879
people in the pharmaceutical industry

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,039
trying to make different products and

139
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,600
one interesting Trend that I've been

140
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,240
seeing lately again getting a lot of

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,139
calls on is actual drug manufacturers

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,460
looking how they can take the

143
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,460
cannabinoids or the distillers or CBD or

144
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:13,019
TC or CBG and add that to an already

145
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:15,239
existing medical API for example one

146
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,758
group without naming names they they

147
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,519
wanted to take lidocaine and add it to

148
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,740
CBG and I couldn't understand what that

149
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,959
effect was but I found it most

150
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,360
interesting that people want to take an

151
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,519
already approved drug and add

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,919
accountability to it and I'm not sure of

153
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,099
the efficacy or how they're going to use

154
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,120
it but it's an interesting trend

155
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,120
um

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,478
I mean to follow up on this combination

157
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,418
is already given by by cannabis itself

158
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,579
it's I would say complex enough

159
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,918
I understand the approach of adding it

160
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:52,318
to lidocaine or whatever active

161
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,318
substance but

162
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,479
um we are maybe already on on the one

163
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,120
Edge while while Physicians not even

164
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:03,899
understand how to start the therapy and

165
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,620
one of the feedbacks is start simple

166
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,538
like one milligram THC once in the

167
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,538
evening

168
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:15,060
once a day so a very simple concept

169
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:19,379
which is just one one active substance

170
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,000
still an extract makes more sense from

171
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,860
from a

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,319
another point of view because the

173
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,819
Terrapins add additional effect through

174
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,000
the Entourage

175
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,979
and certain fractions are even more

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,038
effective than others

177
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:38,579
and when it comes to plants what strain

178
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,879
will be the source to manufacture this I

179
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:44,639
think that the personalized medicine

180
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,519
will in the end be the difference as you

181
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,418
said Antoinette with the with the

182
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,939
prescription on on an individual basis

183
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:55,978
on the ratio at the moment we have THC

184
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:59,759
and CBD but yes there will be other

185
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:02,579
cannabinoids and most likely CBN will be

186
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,160
one of the next one while Regulators

187
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,978
lack behind and in in certain countries

188
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,199
like Switzerland they don't even know

189
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:10,978
how to handle it but it's already on the

190
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,680
market

191
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:17,159
so the potential is there and we want to

192
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,319
we want to make use of that yeah I love

193
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,979
CBN I use it for sleep it's incredible

194
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,979
exactly

195
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,120
I thought we talked a lot about terpenes

196
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,479
clinical trials the latest advancements

197
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,700
in biotech there's so much like

198
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,860
medicinal therapeutic effects from this

199
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,020
plant from the terpenes the cannabinoids

200
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,000
what else is there I think something

201
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,759
that I found which is really cool a new

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,820
startup called kenerta is doing

203
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,500
um Planet cannabis medical products with

204
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,959
the cannabis plant but everything but

205
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,000
the cannabinoids so I'm really excited

206
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,739
about the future of cannabinoids myself

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,740
we're doing a clinical trial for our

208
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,600
suppositories for endometriosis but I'm

209
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,700
really excited to see what they have for

210
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,820
colitis and other things as well

211
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,920
yeah shall I respond of course it's an

212
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,959
open conversation okay so I'm going to

213
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,659
be a little bit controversial and I'm

214
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,539
sure you've heard of a of a saying that

215
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,519
a strength overplayed becomes a weakness

216
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,099
and I've used it with my children all

217
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,980
the time don't overplay your strengths

218
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,980
um but you know for me I think the the

219
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,740
Wonder and the beauty about cannabis is

220
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,778
it's it's a complicated plant with all

221
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,000
of these potential benefits and you know

222
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,620
the terpenes and the flavonoids and and

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,440
the different cannabinoids and all of

224
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,899
that it it's it's like a treasure chest

225
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,480
but you know the the challenge with

226
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,039
cannabis is it's got all of these

227
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,839
different cannabinoids and all of these

228
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,458
different terpenes and I think you know

229
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,380
there was a question that was asked in

230
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,199
my talk earlier which is when is Big

231
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,778
Pharma getting to get involved

232
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,580
um in the Cannabis sector and and I

233
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:56,100
think one of the challenges is this is

234
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,480
we have to make sense of it you know and

235
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,339
and

236
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,778
now this is where I'm going to get a

237
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,120
little bit controversial which is which

238
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:05,220
is we've got to know what we prescribing

239
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,139
you know we've got to know what is in

240
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,899
the makeup of whatever it is you're

241
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,039
prescribing because they do behave so

242
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,980
differently

243
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,079
you know and and and what I've seen is

244
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,200
that there are drug interactions you

245
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,300
know we know that THC potentially has a

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,778
very narrow therapeutic window

247
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:28,319
and so if you have a a flower that is

248
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:30,600
that is very high in THC and somebody

249
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,379
has an underlying cardiac condition or

250
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,339
somebody has glaucoma you you could find

251
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,720
yourself

252
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,980
um prescribing something where you think

253
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,100
it's going to be beneficial but

254
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,959
potentially could have um a detrimental

255
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,540
side effect I mean I saw a study last

256
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,338
week which in a glaucoma study where

257
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,860
where high levels of THC actually

258
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,160
accelerated the route to blindness

259
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,220
rather than actually addressed it so I

260
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,278
once again I I I'm so grateful it please

261
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,320
don't don't see me as trying to have a

262
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,958
go at anybody that's in medical cannabis

263
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,240
or anybody that is is a huge supporter

264
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:08,759
of the plant the reason we're at brains

265
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,500
biosutical have gone down the isolate

266
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,778
route is it's the path of least

267
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,179
resistance to some degree you know

268
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:18,059
Pharma and and Regulators want to know

269
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,458
exactly what is in the capsule or what

270
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,338
is in the pool and so being able to

271
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,559
extract it and then reconstituted with

272
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,660
what we want to put into it to you know

273
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,859
what Clement said over here about you

274
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,778
know we know that there's different

275
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,419
ratios and these different percentages

276
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:35,578
and you know we can play around with

277
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,679
that and then do the studies so I just

278
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,719
you know or all I'm saying is and and

279
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,199
I'm trying to get the debate going as

280
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,240
well but but but you know I think we as

281
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,120
an industry need to make sure that that

282
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,879
a quality is at its utmost at the best

283
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,679
you know secondly we know what is what

284
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,659
is in whatever it is we're prescribing

285
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,000
or we're doing research in it and that

286
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:01,199
we educate whoever is the user or the

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,379
prescriber around where the benefit lies

288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,379
and just that now that you were talking

289
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,879
I thought of one uh challenge that we

290
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:13,139
were talking about at the National

291
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:15,600
Institute of biology is uh not only like

292
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,179
is it com the interaction between like

293
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,940
individuals and the individual strengths

294
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:23,159
and and the ultimate ratios of

295
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:27,180
cannabinoids and other compounds is

296
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,039
complex but uh uh there is also for

297
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,278
example in the in the case of treating

298
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:36,179
tumors and Cancers uh where you know

299
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:38,159
there is no hard evidence uh or FDA

300
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:39,419
great evidence that that it works but

301
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,379
there are

302
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:47,338
people that that got cured by by using

303
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:51,240
uh cannabis there is another element

304
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:53,760
which is uh how do these interactions uh

305
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,419
how did how does the interaction between

306
00:12:53,759 --> 00:13:00,539
the cannabinoids the person the patient

307
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:03,299
and the tumor which has also their own

308
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,338
genetics uh how does this work so I

309
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:07,740
think

310
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:11,279
I I see a I see a challenge for big

311
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,379
Pharma because uh for for our FDA for

312
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,639
that matter how the drugs get approved

313
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,740
is

314
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,379
this is a compound we know exactly what

315
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,139
it does it does this it blocks uh you

316
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,778
know a certain pathway and therefore

317
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,060
there is no disease I think this is far

318
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,578
far more complex and just traditional

319
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,919
way of of trying to understand it's not

320
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:33,899
going to work so uh yeah I'm curious

321
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,240
what others think about what's going to

322
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,500
change I mean um it's it's certainly

323
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,539
difficult to get the market

324
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,259
authorization for a herbal medicine

325
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:46,199
product but there are I mean we have

326
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,200
very complex extracts already that are

327
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,120
used since decades for example for the

328
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,940
treatment of depression we have Saint

329
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,360
John's word extract or for example

330
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,459
specific lavender extract that is used

331
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,339
for the treatment of anxiety and these

332
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:05,879
studies I mean there are like 14 15

333
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,800
clinical trials that were needed safety

334
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,700
studies and coming back to that evidence

335
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:14,819
you have the three pillars that are have

336
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,800
to be followed and these are safety

337
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,860
efficacy and quality

338
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,479
and as a manufacturer you have to take

339
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,419
into account all the quality and

340
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,120
document it while Physicians have to

341
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:30,179
bring the evidence on the efficacy on

342
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,299
the safety level and a cannabis extract

343
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:36,599
can go the same way this is what was

344
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:40,019
shown for a for saltivex for example

345
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,320
which is an extract combination but you

346
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,759
can use actually

347
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,420
extracts that are compliant to

348
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,819
monographs currently at the stage of the

349
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:54,360
dab for example in Germany that will go

350
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,220
to the pharmacopia europea and then you

351
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,680
have the basis for that and it can be

352
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,940
also manufactured directly

353
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:05,278
as a magistral

354
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,880
compounding preparation and that allows

355
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,039
forms like suppositories capsules oils

356
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,139
are the current state but when it comes

357
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,179
to an authorization this is a completely

358
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:18,000
different story there you need the ctd

359
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:22,500
is a common technical document which

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,899
fulfills all the modules of yeah quality

361
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,539
safety and efficacy

362
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,039
and a lot of times when you look at it

363
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:31,439
when you boil it down into your own

364
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,480
world what does it mean and I try to

365
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,320
always look at it from a manufacturer's

366
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,360
standpoint and you know you're trying to

367
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,579
make a product that can come to Market

368
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,180
and you also have to realize the timing

369
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:47,039
of the markets and when you take a look

370
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:50,458
and you say Okay I want to boil this

371
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:54,419
down to a single element I want CBD

372
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:57,000
isolate you know th pure THC isolate and

373
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:00,120
you're looking at making a medicine

374
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,820
because you can analyze that single

375
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,940
element much simpler than you could

376
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,820
analyze the effects on the body of a

377
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,459
full spectrum extract as an example

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,620
and in one side you're trying to reach

379
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,659
that market you know that's looking at

380
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,120
the single elements or in one side

381
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:19,919
you're trying to reach that market uh

382
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,560
that's looking at the herbal extracts

383
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,958
and the Therapeutics effects of terpenes

384
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,539
minor cannabinoids and and a mix and

385
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,179
then trying to you know match what one

386
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:32,278
side wants and another side wants and

387
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,739
manufacture them that product that is

388
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,899
the trick uh that we're always trying to

389
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,720
solve in manufacturing and to some

390
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,458
extent it's not just you know making the

391
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,800
product it becomes what do The

392
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:47,578
Regulators accept and I can go country

393
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,559
by country and and and each one is

394
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:51,778
completely different as far as they're

395
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,399
similar in some ways but they have

396
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,799
differences in other ways how they look

397
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,419
at different delivery methods and how

398
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,698
they want it presented and how they look

399
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,860
at the product and that's a complication

400
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:04,740
that us as manufacturers have to address

401
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,380
on a constant basis

402
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,699
oh yeah tons of hurdles

403
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,439
you know

404
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,539
um and we talked a lot about clinical

405
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,040
trials I love this because it's it's so

406
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:16,500
important and I think it's a huge diff

407
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,359
you know differentiator for adult use

408
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,980
versus medical cannabis and I think that

409
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,019
they should be held to a higher standard

410
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,120
and I just wanted to add because you did

411
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,400
mention Terry that

412
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,739
Pharma isn't in cannabis Pharma is very

413
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,980
much in cannabis I was so happy that

414
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,558
Bayer put together the first cannabis

415
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,480
and endometriosis event specifically for

416
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,918
Endo and I think that goes back to what

417
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,839
you were saying is that we need to

418
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,240
create drugs that are specific to

419
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,879
certain diseases that's the only way how

420
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,079
we can it's not cannabis is great for so

421
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,059
many things but it's not great for

422
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,038
everything but we can create cannabis

423
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,619
drugs specific for you know certain

424
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,919
ailments which is very exciting yeah I I

425
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:58,259
agree and I mean there is former is like

426
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,620
jazz pharmaceutical board GW I mean I

427
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:03,480
know that farmer has a presence here but

428
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:06,119
I think all I was trying to say and I

429
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,099
think to to Simon's point is we've got

430
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,579
to be very comfortable that if you sort

431
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:13,798
of in the in the sort of the the the you

432
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,980
know prescribing flour or broad spectrum

433
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:18,779
or whatever the the path to to giving

434
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,360
patients access to that is most probably

435
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,579
different if compared to if you're in a

436
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,399
clinical trial program and both will

437
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:28,019
serve as a very different cohort of

438
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,660
patients and both are absolutely

439
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:33,960
required you know so the one you know

440
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,419
does require robust clinical evidence

441
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,038
proof of concept studies you know you've

442
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,200
got to you've got to get you make sure

443
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,960
that that you're being approved by by

444
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,700
the local authorities all of that in a

445
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,579
clinical trial program unfortunately

446
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,519
there is only one way pre-clean phase

447
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,319
one phase two phase three and and all of

448
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,918
them um take time and they take money

449
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:59,879
but yeah and I think that's when the

450
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,460
nevadises and and and the gsks and the

451
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,679
the big Pharma I know fazer has dipped

452
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,720
their toe into here and I think they've

453
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,179
just canceled you know just just to stop

454
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,400
that program but I I long to see people

455
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,780
follow bear and and and get into this

456
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,298
Market

457
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,220
and I love that it's clear that we're

458
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,259
all here for patients at the end of the

459
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,720
day we've seen how it's helped people

460
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,279
from all different walks of life

461
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,079
um so I'm curious when it comes to

462
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,460
clinical trials what barriers are you

463
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:28,819
guys facing and how are you getting

464
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,558
around them

465
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:35,038
what I'm interested maybe Simon you know

466
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,720
more uh but what I really liked was the

467
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,200
they did in

468
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,779
UK I believe they did this uh uh the

469
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,880
world evidence-based clinical trials so

470
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:48,119
I think this makes a lot more sense for

471
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,039
for uh for cannabis and that's very true

472
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,519
real world evidence is

473
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:56,220
um maybe I can say it's a collection of

474
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:59,700
the anecdotal evidence that exists but

475
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:02,579
the acceptance by Authority is currently

476
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,919
uh railings in very early stage for

477
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:08,639
approval purposes maybe they allow

478
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,799
certain use extension for authorized

479
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,020
drugs but if you come along and say hey

480
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,179
we have a nice real world evidence study

481
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:18,440
with 30 000 patients

482
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:21,059
well done published in a good Journal

483
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,100
good protocol you follow all the rules

484
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:25,079
they will say oh we're very sorry it's

485
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:27,538
insufficient the gold standard is a

486
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,599
randomized controlled trial and this is

487
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:33,379
where the problem comes in you need the

488
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:35,459
placebo control you need a nice

489
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,400
competitor like

490
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:41,298
um like in in paying you you treat it

491
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,919
against morphine I would bet canap

492
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:46,440
dronabinol as a single substance would

493
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,980
lose against morphine if you choose and

494
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,660
this is now coming back to the hurdle of

495
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,400
um what what is what are the problems in

496
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,980
clinical trials if you choose the wrong

497
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,919
primary endpoint you will fail and never

498
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,259
go into pain you will fail if you say

499
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,480
it's the primary endpoint to reduce pain

500
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:06,900
you will fail this is one of the biggest

501
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,960
challenges anyways in um in clinical

502
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,059
trials to overcome the placebo effect we

503
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,000
know that the endocannabinoid system is

504
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:18,599
significantly producing the placebo

505
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,640
effect this is why on top I mean it's

506
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,038
it's part of the whole thing I'm not

507
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,259
saying that cannabis is a placebo don't

508
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,900
get me wrong

509
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,579
um but to overcome the effect with the

510
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,659
significance and with the clinical

511
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:36,480
relevance secondly is is important to

512
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,760
show The Regulators then that the data

513
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,019
is sufficient to to get the market

514
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:45,839
authorization and my Approach after

515
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:47,158
let's say seven years in in Pharma

516
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,740
industry

517
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:55,340
is now with the scoli Pharma to make

518
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:59,579
on the magistral compounding way

519
00:21:55,339 --> 00:22:03,298
apis that are manufactured like from

520
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:07,199
somai in a high quality available to the

521
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:10,079
patients by direct compounding and and

522
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,140
dispensing in a in a pharmacy and that's

523
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:16,079
a faster way and is accepted I mean

524
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,960
Authority most likely is won't like it

525
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,759
because they prefer the authorization

526
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,860
I don't know if someone is in the

527
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,558
audience from the Bay Farm current at

528
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:28,619
the moment oh not now

529
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:31,259
um but this is actually the way it it

530
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:34,918
goes and like this also evidence is

531
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:37,919
created on on the basis of simple oils

532
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,400
but when it comes to more interesting

533
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,580
formulations like a sublingual patch or

534
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,340
an encapsulated oil

535
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:49,439
um then it's a different story and there

536
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:52,259
we have the possibility to create

537
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,558
evidence provided to the regulators and

538
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:57,000
go the way of the of the prescribed

539
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,099
compounding

540
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,339
so this is maybe a little bit my

541
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:04,558
favorite at the moment I would um I

542
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:08,639
would be happy to join a clinical trial

543
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,859
program I am like a phase one study on

544
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,200
that point also yeah

545
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,779
yeah

546
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,240
I think for me you've got to know what

547
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:21,119
your goal is because the I would say

548
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,220
there's a clinical trial a lot and where

549
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,319
that that that what you want to do is

550
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,659
show a signal and so that you can give

551
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,899
Physicians confidence to prescribe the

552
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:33,480
product for certain conditions

553
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,900
um unfortunately those studies don't

554
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,179
always translate to studies that are

555
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,700
that can be approved by The Regulators

556
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,500
because with The Regulators you know

557
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,140
that you know the very first thing a

558
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,240
phase one study is all about is it safe

559
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,038
and so you've got to you you've got to

560
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,620
make sure you've done a proper pre-clean

561
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:55,379
program you've got to make sure that um

562
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:58,798
you you have done a dose response curve

563
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm amazed at how many times people sort

564
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,579
of almost guessed that let's try this

565
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,100
dose and see if it works rather than

566
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,779
we've done a dose response curve and a

567
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,579
lot of the studies that I've seen at the

568
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:11,038
moment there's an inverse response with

569
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,199
cannabinoids we know you know that that

570
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,579
there comes an optimal point and then at

571
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,279
that point it actually becomes

572
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:20,279
detrimental or the therapeutic effect

573
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,538
um is diminished so you know I think for

574
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,759
me

575
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:26,279
um know what why you're doing this study

576
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,220
and then make sure that that you you

577
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,339
know the criteria by which that study

578
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,839
will be approved by by whoever is the

579
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:35,839
authority that needs to approve it

580
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,099
and what you are saying about

581
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,259
compounding cannabis I think that's the

582
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,279
perfect place that cannabis should be in

583
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:49,259
is in pharmacies like I love hybrid Farm

584
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,579
Canada's first licensed Pharmacy that's

585
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,679
where we started with our cannabis

586
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:54,779
suppositories and we got to see all

587
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,360
these patients with their feedback and

588
00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:00,480
but as soon as we started manufacturing

589
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,000
them at a way higher level we noticed

590
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,220
that there was far more efficacy so I

591
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,380
love that there's opportunity and there

592
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,659
is space for pharmacy but we should be a

593
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,120
lot more open to that I wish Canada

594
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:14,220
would be a little bit more open people

595
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,178
need to learn from hybrid Farm not just

596
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,100
for Canada I know for yeah exactly and

597
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,780
um which brings me to my next question

598
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,719
I'm curious

599
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:27,119
um you know we are it's really exciting

600
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,159
to be at the front of a new drug of new

601
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,439
plant there's so much unknown so I'm

602
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,720
curious from you from you all

603
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,120
what are some ethical considerations

604
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,460
that we should be thinking about when it

605
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,599
comes to the clinical trials or

606
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,600
manufacturing of the plant

607
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,058
I guess you know I always keep staying

608
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,339
on I'll keep continuing on my

609
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:52,200
perspective you know as you look as a

610
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,658
manufacturer you get a lot of people and

611
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,120
a lot of scientists and a lot of doctors

612
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,940
that come through and and they want

613
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,658
things a certain way and that they want

614
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,159
it mixed a certain way and you listen to

615
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,900
them and of course in one way you want

616
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,299
to remain neutral and you're providing

617
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,080
them with a a product that they can do

618
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:14,519
testing on on another side uh you know

619
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:16,619
especially in the Cannabis industry

620
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,918
since you have markets like the US and

621
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:23,099
Canada they have a different perception

622
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,640
than in Europe and they're coming up

623
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:29,658
with let's say solutions that may or may

624
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,000
not possibly uh be healthy for people

625
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:35,460
one solution that I had saw not so long

626
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,220
ago is something common in the U.S which

627
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,400
carries an enzymatic inhibitor and I

628
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,960
thought to myself you know

629
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,240
how can this possibly be good for

630
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,819
somebody who may be taking medication

631
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,579
for something seriously and there is no

632
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,778
warning sign and they're selling this

633
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,178
commercially

634
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:56,579
and although it's not something we would

635
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,679
produce here in Europe

636
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:01,019
um it goes to the ethical question of

637
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,580
what you can and cannot provide and how

638
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,740
you need to label that and what kind of

639
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:07,579
testing needs to go through with that

640
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,558
and when you have a market

641
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:13,918
that's not regulated like the U.S market

642
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:16,079
uh and and it's regulated more on a

643
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,179
restaurant quality basis where there is

644
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,500
nobody saying you can or cannot put that

645
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,360
in there

646
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,460
um you do have ethical questions you

647
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,740
have to ask yourselves

648
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,819
um in that I think less so here in

649
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,919
Europe

650
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,200
um you know the the excipients you use

651
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,720
the ingredients you use how you use them

652
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,519
the quality standards that is attributed

653
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,038
to them it's less of an ethical matter

654
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,720
and it's more of a testing matter

655
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,658
um but you know this would come to mind

656
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,298
when you ask that kind of a question

657
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,820
most definitely people are really bold

658
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:50,038
to get out there but yeah got to take a

659
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:53,278
consideration your thoughts as well yeah

660
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:56,220
I mean I see like

661
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,079
let's say that uh well cannabis is going

662
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,079
to be accepted more and more as uh you

663
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:04,079
know by Pharma and uh approved

664
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:07,259
um I see a potential side effect of this

665
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,480
or negative effect like that it's then

666
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:12,839
perceived as cannabis being like a safe

667
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,220
plant to you know to use recreationally

668
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:16,019
as well which

669
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,339
to some extent that's true but

670
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:22,558
especially in you know in younger adults

671
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:26,519
it can have really bad effects on Mental

672
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:29,038
Health mental development so my concern

673
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,859
with you know this being taken over by

674
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:34,679
Pharma and heavily marketed what kind of

675
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:37,319
impact it will have on you know people

676
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,919
that will now consider it safer than it

677
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,918
actually is

678
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,900
Fair points

679
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,359
I I think one of the biggest challenges

680
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,159
for me is that because it is a natural

681
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,139
plant and because we've got so much

682
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,179
anecdotal evidence

683
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,278
we can sometimes only look at the

684
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,559
benefits of it but we've also got to

685
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:01,460
look at at some of the challenges or

686
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:04,019
some of the side effects with it and and

687
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,819
you guys are the most optimistic group

688
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,099
that I've ever worked with I mean in

689
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:09,899
Pharma we always the the you know the

690
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,899
glass is always half full it's never

691
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,380
half then um a half empty it's never

692
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,538
half full but um I think we do need to

693
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,440
be aware that that you know that

694
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:24,898
particularly if people have concomitant

695
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,759
therapies or or or underlying conditions

696
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:29,099
that we need to be aware of it we know

697
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,558
you know that that that some of the

698
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:33,599
cannabinoids actually suppress the

699
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,879
immune system we also know that the

700
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:39,058
cannabinoids are are broken down through

701
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,679
your p450 cytochrome pathway which is

702
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,019
where your oncology drugs are broken

703
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,240
down where your epileptic drugs are

704
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,798
broken down your antidepressants or

705
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,740
whatever so you could actually have drug

706
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:53,278
interactions or you could actually you

707
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:55,500
know diminish the therapy effect of your

708
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,960
chemotherapy and we've seen that and

709
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,179
certain indications you know we we know

710
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,120
that they come with with side effects

711
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,759
you know THC in particular and stimulate

712
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,139
your cv1 receptors which which from a

713
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,898
cardiac point of view if you've got an

714
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,880
underlying cardiac condition

715
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,678
um that could be really serious so I

716
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,640
think you know I think we've just got to

717
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,860
be really aware of of of of not only the

718
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,980
positives but also where the limitations

719
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:24,839
are and be upfront and honest about that

720
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,778
most definitely

721
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:30,599
I mean also from from a safety point of

722
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:33,558
view the concerns are of novel

723
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:37,918
cannabinoids coming into human already

724
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:41,639
now as a food supplement or um also in

725
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,559
in in waves they can be very high dose

726
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,380
and they do have an effect we are lucky

727
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,720
that cannabinoids are from a

728
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:53,820
toxicological point of view

729
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,860
um not leading to death in that way when

730
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:58,200
dosing High you have your intoxication

731
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:01,319
but they are in a way safe but

732
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,340
therapeutic window is still have to be

733
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:08,000
taken into account and there um you're

734
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:10,259
you're perfectly right I mean the

735
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,798
pharmacokinetic interactions for example

736
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:16,440
of CBD to inhibit the p450 side to

737
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:19,918
chromes that absolutely important to

738
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,500
mention to patients especially when you

739
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,360
are not labeling it and at the moment

740
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,220
there is only

741
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:30,119
um to the best of my knowledge one

742
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:34,259
authorized CBD drug that contains the

743
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,359
proper labeling in the in the smpc and

744
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:39,658
in in the patient information leaflet

745
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:42,479
not to take it in combination with or

746
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:45,600
always under doctor's prescription so

747
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,339
you don't want to actually have a bad

748
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:51,298
impact on

749
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:53,278
let's say a pro drug that would make

750
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:55,619
your blood thin and it doesn't work

751
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,740
anymore and then it leads to some more

752
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:02,418
severe effect so this is about let's say

753
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:05,159
ethics responsibility that we have to

754
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:07,440
see and and where we have to provide

755
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,640
also evidence from a safety point of

756
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,538
view

757
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,159
yes safety and access right

758
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:16,798
um

759
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:18,480
so what I love about ICBC is that we

760
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,639
have a lot of people here from all

761
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,819
around the world we have policy makers

762
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,960
we have manufacturers we have you know a

763
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,278
lot of people from so many different

764
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,919
walks of life in cannabis it's

765
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,460
incredibly powerful so I'm curious from

766
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,559
you guys what your thoughts are on how

767
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,558
policy government

768
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,960
um Academia universities

769
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:42,898
work together at the Cannabis industry

770
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,000
to accelerate research I feel like it's

771
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:47,579
a no-brainer that this research needs to

772
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,720
be done I've done before you know even

773
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:52,859
adult use legalization I think so what

774
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,960
are your thoughts and how can we

775
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:57,418
accelerate This research and have you

776
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,720
seen other companies do that partner

777
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:03,778
together in terms of government Academia

778
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,419
and Manufacturing

779
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:09,659
one thing it's nice that I can point to

780
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:11,220
in the EU is I mean at least I can speak

781
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,980
for Portugal and I'm sure it's for other

782
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,019
countries I'm just not aware of them

783
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,339
um the the government seem extremely

784
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:19,679
supportive through research and

785
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:23,038
development grants where you can get up

786
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,679
to 70 percent of your money back that

787
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,259
you invest in what they would call Gray

788
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,559
matter you know in your brain power to

789
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:33,778
create IP and create development this is

790
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:36,240
something pretty unique uh that the the

791
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:38,700
governments actually support you uh in

792
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,519
that way and cannabis has uh has access

793
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,500
to that and so for people I always try

794
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,079
to encourage people that come through to

795
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,240
try to get on those applications or to

796
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:51,298
at least think about them they're

797
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,220
released every so often and and to be

798
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:56,519
you know up on that and I think that's

799
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,460
an easy way for let's say uh an industry

800
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,500
that's not as capitalized uh as the

801
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,778
larger groups the pfizers and the mercs

802
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,538
where they have a lot more money to to

803
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:09,960
to research things and have interest in

804
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:11,759
many areas but for ours at least there

805
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,500
is access and there are places where

806
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,500
people can get access currently

807
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:23,280
uh maybe from a Swiss perspective and

808
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,739
yeah Switzerland is one of the most

809
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,820
Innovative countries in the world we

810
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,459
have

811
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,820
um the possibility to

812
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,559
um in in a small and very Dynamic and

813
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,559
very Progressive

814
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:41,579
um project which is interprofessionally

815
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:44,699
built to push forward certain medical

816
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:49,079
cannabis applications and then there is

817
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:53,338
a direct link to to The Regulators that

818
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:56,639
will see the data also so um it's uh in

819
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:59,460
a way evidence has to be created that's

820
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,980
that's That's the basis and acceleration

821
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,159
of that process

822
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,099
in my opinion always needs like a doctor

823
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,899
it needs maybe a pharmacist but it also

824
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:13,800
needs the nurses and it also needs the

825
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,980
patients so there must be working groups

826
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:20,460
that are diverse and that cover all

827
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:23,400
ranges from let's say the plant to the

828
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,159
patient and then on top of that you need

829
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,720
an education program to communicate that

830
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,000
good data that you have generated

831
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:32,819
because if you don't talk about it no

832
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,880
one will know and Authority they don't

833
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,740
know they you you must teach them so you

834
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,800
must show them the data they don't just

835
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:43,819
trust like a lot of people do because

836
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,160
they have an effect these cannabinoids

837
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:51,660
we know that but if you show that on

838
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:54,299
paper to non-users to non-patients and

839
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:55,980
that of authority sites and then they

840
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,519
will accept it

841
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,338
but it must be an interplay a teamwork I

842
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,780
agree I think one a great example is um

843
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:07,259
I work really closely with the

844
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,720
endometriosis Society of Canada and so

845
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,119
we sponsor their events we share all of

846
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:14,459
the you know medical education that we

847
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,579
have with them we share a doctor if they

848
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,320
ever need one but they've also brought

849
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:21,060
work to me they brought um the

850
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,980
University of Sydney Australia they're

851
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:24,539
doing the clinical trial on

852
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,240
endometriosis and they were looking for

853
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,980
a product and they recommended us so I

854
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,419
think that if you are working in a

855
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,159
medical cannabis I think that's a great

856
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,079
way to accelerate is really building

857
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,519
your community in that specific disease

858
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,500
and I think that goes back to what

859
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,199
Michael is saying is that these products

860
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,599
should be by you know for specific

861
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:46,559
ailments because it's going to help

862
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,200
yeah and we're almost wrapping up soon

863
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,059
I wanted to also ask you guys

864
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,739
um you know what do you want people to

865
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,259
leave here with about knowing about

866
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:57,179
medical cannabis and biotech and what

867
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,859
you think the future will be you know I

868
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:01,319
think that a lot can happen in the next

869
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:04,078
decade a lot has happened in this decade

870
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,579
in medical cannabis so I would love for

871
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,960
that to be the last question

872
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:09,180
all right Arkansas

873
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,760
um I just think I would what I would ask

874
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:14,219
of all of you is whatever field you in

875
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,040
whether it is in medical cannabis

876
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:19,078
whether it's in drug development whether

877
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,358
it is a nutraceutical and and

878
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,400
over-the-counter products you know just

879
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,338
just set yourself the highest bar

880
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,019
possible you know it just it's just so

881
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:31,078
concerning that every time the Swiss

882
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:33,000
Canton of pharmacies do an audit and 95

883
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,460
of products have to be removed from the

884
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,139
Shelf because they don't meet the spec

885
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,059
you know they've either haven't got

886
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:40,920
enough active ingredient or the impurity

887
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:43,019
levels are too high or whatever it might

888
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,420
be and so for me it's just you know

889
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:47,219
ultimately we need each other you know

890
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,720
there's not there's not one Silver

891
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,118
Bullet chair that's going to solve it

892
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,919
all we all need to work together and

893
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,960
collectively we need all of the

894
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,838
different areas that you're in but let's

895
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,119
let's not tarnish the industry and

896
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,279
confirm what Pharma and some of the

897
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,680
politicians think you know with their

898
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,960
skeptic Minds let's show them that we

899
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,759
can set the highest and Pioneer and

900
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,338
personalized medicine evidence

901
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:15,740
generation Etc

902
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:15,739
yeah and kind of actually to your point

903
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,060
also from the starting question right

904
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:22,460
well it gets me excited is uh the

905
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:25,078
technology technological Advance

906
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,460
advancements with with growing the plant

907
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,980
so

908
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,679
um here I see like also as a take-home

909
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,300
message you know

910
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,858
if we are going towards for

911
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,680
pharmaceutical industry basically

912
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:40,559
creating a biological drug right so in

913
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,419
that sense uh as a standard way of doing

914
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,820
biological drugs you have this huge

915
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,400
bioreactors with you know exact control

916
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:50,059
what goes in what comes out real-time

917
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,680
sensorics and I think like you know if

918
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:56,219
cannabis it's a plant it doesn't have

919
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:58,379
that built in but we are going towards

920
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:00,838
there and there is a lot of Technology

921
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,559
that's out there that can be implemented

922
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:07,980
you know Machine Vision our company does

923
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:10,320
uh infusion for the plants so so you can

924
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,820
control exactly what goes in there are

925
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,800
companies here that we met that do

926
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,200
real-time measurements of various

927
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,339
compounds that can indicate the health

928
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:24,179
of the plant obviously cannabinoids a

929
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:26,639
cannabinoid composition so to your point

930
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:28,379
yeah I agree we need to it's exciting

931
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,139
but also the whole industry needs to

932
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,559
professionalize uh it's happening the

933
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:37,500
growth uh the the production facilities

934
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,719
need to get to that to that point where

935
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,579
it's very clear what's happening we

936
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:43,199
understand we understand the genetics we

937
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,480
understand what goes in what comes out

938
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:49,199
and uh and yeah that's that's I think

939
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,199
the one of the crucial paths forward

940
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:54,299
just a is a closing idea

941
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:56,578
they're in cannabis there's something

942
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,579
for everybody uh depending on how you're

943
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:02,099
looking at it of course you have the

944
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,420
well-known uh Apple dialects and sativax

945
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,720
and the people

946
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,480
um and and maybe 1 000 plus different uh

947
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,279
trials that are going on now at that

948
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,039
kind of a level

949
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,019
um but there's also the herbal medicine

950
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,579
medicinal level

951
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:20,039
um you know another level that people

952
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:23,099
can participate on

953
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,500
um and there's you don't have to just go

954
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,119
out and try if you're thinking biotech

955
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,159
you're thinking IP protection you're

956
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,140
thinking these drugs um but there's

957
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:33,000
little things that you can do and

958
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:34,858
sometimes you got to look at that for

959
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,019
where is your the reality and what

960
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,578
you're trying to accomplish and I

961
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:41,099
believe there's there's a place for

962
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:44,300
everybody inside of this this space and

963
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,300
you just have to unlock it

964
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,619
I think the to maximize the medical use

965
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:55,920
of this um

966
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:56,900
cannabis plant and to to have the the

967
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,119
the

968
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:03,119
potential really used in in different

969
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,000
diseases and indication we have to

970
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,940
partner up and to create scientific

971
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,420
evidence together so that also

972
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:15,420
Regulators are further convinced to me

973
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,000
this is actually at a high

974
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,700
pharmaceutical standards necessary I

975
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,739
think and in the end will help the whole

976
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:24,838
industry

977
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:27,479
most definitely I love that tip on

978
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,759
entrepreneurship or even if you're you

979
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,039
know growing in your career in cannabis

980
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,800
this is a very long game and I think

981
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,838
it's just about keeping keep going and

982
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,180
you know partnering partnering together

983
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,980
I believe that there is a place for

984
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:43,559
everyone here as well there's so much

985
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,900
space and so much potential it's really

986
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,170
up to us

987
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:54,780
oh thank you so much guys

988
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:54,780
[Applause]
