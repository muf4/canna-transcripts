of you don't know me i'm tom zuber i'm

74
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,639
the managing partner of super waller we

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,560
have many candidates uh in america since

76
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,559
2006 which makes us a dinosaur that was

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,158
uh i think we were probably the first

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,080
bonafide corporate law firm to be in

79
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,359
space or certainly one of them so we

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
represent a large percentage of the

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
biggest brands

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
um in

83
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,719
north american candidates and it's

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
pleasure to be here so let's go ahead

85
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,959
and get started uh with sonya uh sonya

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,800
uh this is a question for the whole

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
group let's uh start with you uh where

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
is the european cannabis market heading

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,959
over the next six twelve months

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,840
thank you tom um

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,158
obviously we all want to see

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,799
the recreational market opening

93
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,798
and following the the

94
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,400
public consultation hearing

95
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
which has been concluded

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,080
in the past month

97
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,719
i think the regulation is now heading

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,400
towards the final stages

99
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,759
and we will hopefully see a draft law

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,879
reaching the parliament by the end of

101
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,479
the year

102
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,439
the agenda is clearly very ambitious

103
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,439
and

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,239
but however there are a lot of political

105
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,840
and legislative hurdles such as the u.n

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
single convention

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,640
as well as

108
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,039
the shame treaty for example um and

109
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,479
yeah and i think that

110
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,840
i think the most important thing is

111
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,359
really

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,400
to see

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,439
government um

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,280
let's say establishing those social and

115
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:21,839
and health as well as commercial um and

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,359
taxation policies um

117
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,719
to be able to

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
um

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,520
let's say provide or secure

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
a functioning market

121
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,758
when

122
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,839
looking at the

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
the cbd industry

124
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,638
this is

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
let's say

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,319
it's going through quite a rough time at

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,080
the moment

128
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,279
especially in germany and simply because

129
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,039
of the very

130
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:52,319
complicated regulatory environment

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,639
non-foods is still an issue and

132
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,680
especially in germany we are still

133
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,680
seeing authorities going against cbd

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
products

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,478
and

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,479
which makes it really difficult for

137
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,199
companies to

138
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:10,319
to really deliver a sustainable business

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,400
model um

140
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,399
i think that um

141
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,758
looking at some other markets in europe

142
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,120
like like uk for example or um or the

143
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,038
netherlands where

144
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,120
cbd is tolerated but it's still sold as

145
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,120
a food supplement

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
they are performing much better

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
and even

148
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,279
the conversation that we're having now

149
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,839
with the uk companies they're all saying

150
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,000
that the market has recovered quite well

151
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,758
possible or post lockdowns especially in

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,079
the brick and mortar market

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,240
um but the the trend in germany has been

154
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,159
mostly negative and we're seeing

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
declining revenues

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,039
but also um

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,960
there's very little willingness um so in

158
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,360
terms of scale we're seeing very little

159
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,799
willingness um from the the bigger

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,600
retail chains to list cbd products

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,280
in absence of um legal clarity so um so

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,160
i think that

163
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,079
this is we're still far away um and the

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,080
normal foods um

165
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,599
process and then and everything that

166
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,839
is doing also on the toxicological

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,840
studies and so on i think this is this

168
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,239
is gonna take a while so it's not going

169
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,918
to be an easy fix we'll see how this

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
will this will evolve

171
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,519
um but

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,000
yeah but in general it's uh it's the cbd

173
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,478
industry at the moment it's not not

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,399
not an easy place to be i have to say

175
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,079
it's not impossible we have managed with

176
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,839
our own brand our risk together quite a

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,560
bit market share and even last year we

178
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,560
expanded to 30 countries and and we are

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,759
a place that's our say our products are

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,759
placed with the

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,520
major retailers because we have been

182
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,840
building a brand since the beginning and

183
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,839
i think this is something that is

184
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,159
very important and something that has

185
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,198
been neglected in the past in the cbd

186
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
space

187
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,919
and the the

188
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
we are seeing much more quality brands i

189
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,719
have to say on the market but i think

190
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,638
that as we move on and um as the

191
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
industry expands this will be even much

192
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,720
more important and i think those brands

193
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,439
who are those companies who are building

194
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,280
brands and who are building a compelling

195
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,560
story behind the brand will ultimately

196
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,519
be the winners

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,800
um in general i think when we look at

198
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,519
the the

199
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,079
market from medical perspective and

200
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,439
there is or in general just the catalyst

201
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,598
market there is still a lot of

202
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,560
stigma there is still

203
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,759
a lack of understanding of cannabis

204
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
um

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,800
the medical market in germany

206
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,199
is by far the biggest in europe

207
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
um but

208
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,478
there is only

209
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
still only two percent of the doctors

210
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,079
willing to prescribe

211
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,839
a medical cannabis there are different

212
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,359
reasons for that but i think it really

213
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,719
comes down to the to the legal framework

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,400
to the education and um and also to to

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,879
to people at the evidence that there is

216
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,439
just not enough although there is real

217
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
life out of evidence which is has a lot

218
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,240
of validation and it shouldn't be

219
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,399
ignored

220
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
but that educational process needs to

221
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,279
happen um

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,680
uh education needs to happen and also um

223
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,598
let's see a more simplified little

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
framework in europe

225
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,878
um

226
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,720
just to

227
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
be able to to allow the industry to

228
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
expand

229
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,918
um so

230
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,240
so yeah i think

231
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:38,399
for me that legal

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,200
clarity both on the thc and cbd side

233
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,000
will have to happen um and we will see

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,839
the industry expand and um which will

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,879
then hopefully bring the

236
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,760
the very much stability um

237
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,080
especially on the on the capital markets

238
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,399
thank you that was very helpful overview

239
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
and martin or benedict um would you mind

240
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,159
telling us doing a bit more of a dive

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
into germany what's going on here as

242
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,120
long as we're here uh particularly on

243
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,080
the recreational front what are we going

244
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
to see

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,000
over the next couple years in regards to

246
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
recreational candidates here in in

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,080
germany

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
shall i kick it off

249
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,278
so so first of all what was already

250
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
mentioned is we're like in the middle of

251
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,000
the legalization process which is

252
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:23,919
amazing um germany is like really the

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,639
driving force i would consider that

254
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,679
and

255
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,600
it might be that germany will be the

256
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,319
starting point for a whole domino effect

257
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
across europe so what we do here is like

258
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
really

259
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
a thing that didn't happen in history

260
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,599
it's huge we should be all aware of that

261
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,958
and when it comes to the german market

262
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,440
we already know that there is a existing

263
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,359
illicit market they are already

264
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,560
in on an annual base

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,959
400 maybe 800 metric tons

266
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,199
sold on an annual base

267
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,518
um trying to translating this into a

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,278
addressable market we're talking about

269
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,000
maybe four or even eight billion euros

270
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,720
as a addressable market when we use the

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,639
10 euros per gram as a

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,240
figure for

273
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,879
a ballot price

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,879
so the economic perspective is massive

275
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,519
and in addition to that

276
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,958
it is also clear that

277
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
the state

278
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,119
the federal republic they can benefit

279
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,879
from such a program

280
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,120
and i think which is good and what we

281
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,600
heard already today among

282
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,560
those great panels

283
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
is that everyone is aware of that

284
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,119
and i think

285
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,559
everyone here in this room feels this

286
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,000
intense

287
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,078
process already is excited about it but

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,120
me as someone who's like in the middle

289
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,439
of the industry

290
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,759
obviously talking to

291
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,079
politicians talking to other suppliers

292
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,720
talking to distributors talking to

293
00:10:54,078 --> 00:11:00,078
pharmacies or potential point of sales

294
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,040
there is still just this aspect that we

295
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,919
need to to wait for some further clarity

296
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,639
so

297
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,479
a lot of things can still go wrong but

298
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,278
if we

299
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,079
have this debates these discussions um i

300
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,720
believe that also timeline wise what mr

301
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,199
lienert mentioned earlier this morning

302
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,920
if we have a draft law beginning of next

303
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,160
year there is a real

304
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,838
opportunity that

305
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,439
quite shortly after that we have the

306
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,399
first start of sales and that's

307
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,519
something i'm super excited about

308
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,039
and then what we also saw last week is

309
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,600
that malta luxembourg and germany

310
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:43,919
published a joint statement on certain

311
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,600
regulatory aspects of the

312
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,719
cannabis frame work which is also a nice

313
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,399
indicator that things are also

314
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,959
discussed on the european level that's

315
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,360
what also you saw you mentioned

316
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,199
during single convention european

317
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
law and all that and that's a good sign

318
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,360
and i'm very optimistic

319
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
very good and what's a short timeframe

320
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
assuming

321
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,720
that legislation passes early next year

322
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,360
it's a short time frame six months 12

323
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,600
months 24 months before we see the first

324
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,639
sales recreation

325
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,159
so it's really hard to assess because a

326
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,759
lot of

327
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,240
bits and pieces

328
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,200
are irresponsibility of the regulator

329
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,639
and of

330
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,320
yeah governmental authorities but we

331
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,278
have a clear commitment from our

332
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,240
government that within their legislative

333
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,838
period there will be cannabis legally

334
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,600
sold in germany that's what they

335
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,000
mentioned in their coalition agreement

336
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,600
so it definitely will be before

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
september 2025 that's a clear commitment

338
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,720
and if i were them i would try to make

339
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,759
this happen earlier to also have this

340
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,639
like

341
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,600
yeah

342
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,519
support for a future election maybe from

343
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,680
all the people not only in this room but

344
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,039
out there because i believe the society

345
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,039
is ready for it

346
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,519
indeed uh gyarados would you mind

347
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,199
telling us what's going on in spain on

348
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,278
the thc front

349
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
medicinal and if you if you care too

350
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,240
recreational as well

351
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,639
sure sort of thing

352
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,680
in spain medical regulation just just

353
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
happened

354
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,919
it will be implemented like

355
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,360
like in a year we are

356
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,919
one step behind from german for example

357
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,320
but that's a good news for spain the

358
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,639
medical agency has now like six months

359
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
to to study the health subcommission

360
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,560
resolution

361
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:36,000
and this medical revolution

362
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,838
revolution will allow people access to

363
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,639
cannabis and

364
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,240
with medical conditions like multiple

365
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,278
sclerosis sounds seizure disorders

366
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,639
endometriosis natural and vomiting or

367
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,039
chemotherapy

368
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
pain related to cancer chronic pain

369
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,799
including

370
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,799
neuropathic pain so it's believable to

371
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,799
grow in spain for

372
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,559
a lot of years but when this medical

373
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,198
regulation

374
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,319
is implemented pharmacy will be able to

375
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,639
dispense

376
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
to qualify patients the situation is not

377
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,320
as commercial

378
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,159
in other countries but

379
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,278
it's a significant progress and

380
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,000
for growth

381
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,198
and this is the situation now but keep

382
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,039
an eye on

383
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,519
spain because

384
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:28,000
the political party in power they asked

385
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,679
to my field to draft an adult

386
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
jewish regulation last year the

387
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,759
regulations would be imported as soon as

388
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,240
this year

389
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,120
it doesn't make it within that is an

390
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,278
important first step to lead more change

391
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,240
in the near future so let's see what

392
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,519
happened

393
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,839
wonderful and

394
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,519
uh why don't we stay with you uh uh

395
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,519
guillermo and can you tell us a bit

396
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,039
about the spanish cbd market and what's

397
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,879
going on

398
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,838
yeah of course

399
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,559
and

400
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,720
like the minority countries in europe

401
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,198
spain has not its own cv regulation but

402
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
there is a huge market above security

403
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,559
products in

404
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,879
in spain and

405
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,039
i think spanish consumers that's why

406
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,838
actually use cbd at much higher rates

407
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,639
than

408
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,560
other countries in europe so as i said

409
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,560
there is a really really big market in

410
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,559
there right now we are seeing a lot of

411
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,198
companies making moves to

412
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,119
establish their position in the in the

413
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,679
market ahead of

414
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,000
legal change in the future

415
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,879
i don't think changed after the european

416
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,919
court resolution on cv a lot of things

417
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,439
change something in a in a good way and

418
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,319
i'm going to spend

419
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,639
weekly like these three segments of the

420
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,199
mic we have you know we have like silly

421
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,720
flowers uh cosmetic products and

422
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,240
food supplements

423
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,160
talking about silly flowers and as i put

424
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,560
that there i have to tell you that you

425
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:58,000
still can get in trouble and you will be

426
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:01,119
cd flowers but there is a lot a lot of

427
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,720
demand for this product and

428
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,679
risk comes

429
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,519
with a good business opportunities also

430
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,799
i want you to know that we are being

431
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,039
successful in every single case we are

432
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,879
in every single location

433
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,000
on course because obviously yeah we are

434
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:21,120
selling a serious area

435
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,679
but acid flower is not

436
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,919
this psychoactive

437
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,799
is not psychoactive the public health is

438
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,919
not increased and this is what what our

439
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,278
judges and brazilians are starting to to

440
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,719
understand now

441
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,278
you can also if you want to see the

442
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,560
flowers import these flowers from any

443
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,720
european legal market and for you to

444
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,758
know if you have been explained

445
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,320
in a short video for in the last one two

446
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,959
years there is so many stores and city

447
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,278
flowers and thankfully this is not gonna

448
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,278
appear to be a priority for for the

449
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,919
police

450
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,559
cosmetic products and

451
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,319
cosmetic valve containing cannons were

452
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,439
never focused for

453
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,640
the police and even less now

454
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,919
after the

455
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,880
after european added cbd cbd and syria

456
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,759
to

457
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
all level ingredients in cosmetics i'm

458
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,838
talking about possibilities and as

459
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,119
everybody knows the european use for

460
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,519
cosmetic ingredients and about food

461
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,239
supplements i think that everybody knows

462
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,359
that i said already we'll have to wait

463
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,038
what happened with the european food

464
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,038
administration let's see that's what

465
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,960
happened but especially

466
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,960
really good place now to set up a

467
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,600
company you can do it quickly and

468
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,519
expensively there is a huge market there

469
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,279
is a present

470
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,440
a significant sort of

471
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,918
mid-term opportunity for growth

472
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,120
and for interpreters who are not afraid

473
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,120
of a piece of risk there is

474
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,719
another opportunity to get an

475
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:57,038
early foothold in the market with many

476
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,440
kind of users prior to further

477
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,839
realization and just regulates a really

478
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
good moment to think about franchise as

479
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,038
well

480
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,200
thank you guillermo uh it's very helpful

481
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,200
with you uh benedict uh do you want to

482
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,679
tell us the medical campus market is so

483
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,720
exciting uh to watch uh from the u.s

484
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,840
perspective here in europe um i'd like

485
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,679
to hear your thoughts on the whole

486
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,558
panel's thoughts but starting with you

487
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,080
uh

488
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,480
is the medical market here still

489
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,480
attractive from your perspective and

490
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,120
what um what is the right timing to

491
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,960
engage uh the european cannabis market

492
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,558
from both domestic

493
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,558
practitioners from domestic companies

494
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,839
and inspiring companies and also from

495
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,359
the international perspective looking

496
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,678
into europe

497
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,079
yeah so first first of all exciting that

498
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,960
you also talk about medical cannabis

499
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,439
today i think of many are very much

500
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,720
focusing on recreational but let's face

501
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,600
it the only

502
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,120
legal market for germany and many other

503
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,918
countries in germany is the medical and

504
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,599
cannabis market and the development

505
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,840
first

506
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,079
it's super exciting

507
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,279
how it started here in 2017. we were

508
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:06,720
talking about 1.7 metric tons

509
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:10,399
sales in 2017. last year we were up at

510
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,279
15 trans so it's quite a significant

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,720
increase and we expect for the next few

512
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,599
years a

513
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,400
further very positive development

514
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,240
however if we when we then

515
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
deep dive into

516
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,640
different parts of this german market

517
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,120
and i talk about the european market in

518
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
a bit we need to look at

519
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,839
patient

520
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,759
numbers of patients we need to look at

521
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:37,119
pharmacies and we

522
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,759
need to look at doctors first there are

523
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,399
around 300 000 patients in the general

524
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:45,720
market if we compare that for example to

525
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,320
canada in a world

526
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,558
pre-legalization of adult use in this

527
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,399
country there were figures like one

528
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,279
percent of the population

529
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,919
that seem to be pretty reasonable so we

530
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,038
have some uh potential here in germany

531
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,640
300 000 versus a potential of maybe 800

532
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,480
000 that's

533
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,080
0.1 and those patients are divided into

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,159
self-payers so very cost sensitive

535
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,839
payers and

536
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,120
people and patients that are under

537
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,599
statutory health insurance coverage

538
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,359
and this is important to understand that

539
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,678
the part of

540
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,399
those self-payers that are

541
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,640
rather constant price sensitive they

542
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,519
might transfer in a

543
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,240
legalized analyzed market maybe into

544
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,519
cell therapy if the offer in a adult use

545
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,679
market

546
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,679
is maybe cheaper and you have comparable

547
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,559
products so that's that's important the

548
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,759
second group i wanted to to look at is

549
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:49,038
the numbers of doctors and that was also

550
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,038
already mentioned

551
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,079
there are not many doctors actually

552
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,960
prescribing medical cannabis in germany

553
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,319
it's a limited number there can be still

554
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
a significant

555
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,359
growth

556
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,759
and this comes back to a

557
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,000
more professional application

558
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,839
which needs to be implemented and we as

559
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,240
an industry need to work

560
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,240
on and last but not least

561
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,679
i think it's quite interesting that out

562
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,599
of 18 000 pharmacies only around maybe

563
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,519
two or three thousand pharmacies in

564
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,079
germany are regularly dealing and

565
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:25,599
handling cannabis and

566
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:29,279
just maybe 100 are responsible for

567
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,399
significant portions of the market and

568
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,399
and

569
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,880
revenue and it's also

570
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,759
exciting to see that we have on each of

571
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,120
those

572
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,519
groups still a huge uh potential but if

573
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,000
legal legalization

574
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,599
of error use happens there might be a

575
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,159
effect however i still believe it's a

576
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,240
attractive medical cannabis market in

577
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,559
germany so there's still plenty of

578
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,279
opportunities to enter the market

579
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,839
however it's not like two three or five

580
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,399
years ago um where you just needed to

581
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,839
had a product and then

582
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
somehow you get

583
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,000
can can sell it you need to be smart you

584
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,599
need to really think through what's your

585
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
business about what's your part of the

586
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,439
value chain what's your value

587
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,319
preposition and then there's still a lot

588
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,640
of opportunity to make a good business

589
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,678
and for the european opportunity

590
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,600
obviously

591
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,080
germany is a bit unique because we have

592
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:27,038
statue health insurance coverage which

593
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:30,240
helps to like really accelerate

594
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:33,919
potential sales accelerate

595
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,720
revenues but we see in other markets

596
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,679
let's look at malta let's look at poland

597
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,600
um we see that exports are already for

598
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,000
example happening into those countries

599
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,599
so there is something happening and on

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
the other hand

601
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,439
there are suppliers cultivation sites in

602
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,679
denmark in spain and portugal so there's

603
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,440
a whole ecosystem that um developed over

604
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,640
the last few years and those companies

605
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,480
are also

606
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
making good businesses

607
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,839
it's wonderful any any other thoughts on

608
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,079
the panel here particularly as to the

609
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,000
timing when is the right timing to enter

610
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,199
the european market from the perspective

611
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,119
because others put inside uh inside it

612
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,600
um yeah

613
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,279
i just wanted to say i'm also thankful

614
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,359
to be here and i think the recreational

615
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,038
thing they will do it it may take longer

616
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,798
but they they want to have the tax

617
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:27,359
anyway so um but again this doesn't help

618
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,200
us over the next to 12 months

619
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,959
so this is the original question what

620
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,200
what is not going to look like in 6 or

621
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,000
12 months so

622
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,159
you know

623
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,640
middle year we have crisis going on in

624
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,679
europe we have a very

625
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,278
tense

626
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,720
macroeconomic climate we have

627
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,558
we're struggling with european finances

628
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,278
european central bank is not really

629
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,720
daring to put up the interest rates

630
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,480
to a certain level

631
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,440
because they say that the economy will

632
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,599
go down again so these are all framework

633
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,000
conditions that are not ideal for the

634
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,678
market not even in the healthcare market

635
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,440
it's not a b2c if we're talking about

636
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,919
medical cannabis it's not about it's not

637
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,400
a b2c business right here um but

638
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,200
nevertheless investor climate

639
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,720
is is decreasing it's getting worse and

640
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,640
yeah and we as m a lawyers we see that

641
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,798
we've been are told by the by the pe

642
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,720
investors what the climate is look we're

643
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,400
like like pre-indicators

644
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,000
um we're not driving with this but i see

645
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,400
what's going on in deal activity and

646
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,038
this is already reproduced

647
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,200
and and this is um i think it has to be

648
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,278
regarded closely but look that closely

649
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
we cannot say because recreation of this

650
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,278
is a good new thing

651
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,599
hey this is two years ago at two years

652
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,839
in the future sorry two years to go and

653
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,038
this will not help us immediately and so

654
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,119
the industry

655
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,720
has to face and also

656
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,879
companies willing to do business here

657
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,200
have to face that this is still a pharma

658
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,360
business it's a real pharma business and

659
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,000
pharma is complicated it's highly

660
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,759
regulated it takes long it requires huge

661
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,519
investment it

662
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,839
takes years

663
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,679
i mean investors have really bought up

664
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,558
the order into the infrastructure

665
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,679
already

666
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,918
yeah

667
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,120
so they they have this

668
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:17,840
um i would invite investors to go on and

669
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:20,719
and you know develop new um new um

670
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:23,038
medicines on cannabis spaces and we've

671
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,200
just had little products and the market

672
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,440
is not unlimited but it's still there

673
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,679
but the recreational will not help us

674
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,679
out of this out of this situation

675
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,200
um and nevertheless i'm confident that

676
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,278
this this industry will grow and

677
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,440
i mean in terms of the political

678
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,798
plan here in germany

679
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,600
it's good that we have this kind of

680
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,480
leadership in this area of cannabis i

681
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,918
would

682
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,360
hope that

683
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,679
government would show this leadership

684
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:52,319
maybe in other areas as well i mean they

685
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,240
need to drive this because the economy

686
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,158
in the world is not great at the moment

687
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,798
you know we have divided worlds they

688
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,039
need to help the industry move forward

689
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,519
that's that's my that's my that's my

690
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,519
view and uh yeah i hope you all can

691
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,879
contribute to that

692
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,119
thank you martin and mark let's stay

693
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,640
with you uh but this is really open for

694
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,158
the whole panel i'd love to hear

695
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,679
everyone's perspective

696
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,039
on this do you have any advice for

697
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,720
companies that are looking to enter the

698
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,079
european market and that's a general

699
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,319
question

700
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,399
yeah you get a general answer so i

701
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,558
cannot comment on the on the european

702
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,278
individual you know we have no harmless

703
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,879
market in this area apparently

704
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:33,679
so um i would just say um if we talk to

705
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,840
people willing to enter the market

706
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,000
well go to germany

707
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,720
it's the largest market it's well

708
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,640
equipped we have the infrastructure

709
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,558
and the infrastructure

710
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,720
also the players in this area we've

711
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,359
spoken about this before we have this

712
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,880
panel and it's already set you know

713
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,678
there were a couple of deals they have

714
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,080
bought in every now everyone knows what

715
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,440
to do the cannabis agency is working so

716
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,359
the volumes are not high but the

717
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
infrastructure is working so you can

718
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,719
settle here and you can use germany as a

719
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,440
starting point for a european expansion

720
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,600
i mean if you you have to be sure when

721
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,480
you come to germany of course apart from

722
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,639
the regulatory stuff and the the tax um

723
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,558
and set up you have to be sure what

724
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,480
product are you accepting are you gonna

725
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,480
be an investment company like a buy and

726
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,399
build company

727
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,278
so you know we know that in germany also

728
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,519
these concepts are pursued or are you

729
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,720
a developer are you are you trading a

730
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:33,119
mixture of everything in early stage

731
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,759
in early phases of a market this can

732
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,079
attract attention from investors but it

733
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,679
also dilutes your business case and in

734
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,359
the end investors want to earn money and

735
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,600
they want to have also key investors

736
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:47,359
they want to have a clear view

737
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,158
on the on the cash line yeah and if you

738
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,398
guess

739
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,480
i think there can only be one platform

740
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,879
or two platforms but not a third and not

741
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,519
a fourth fourth one you really need to

742
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,200
specialize you need to be aware that

743
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:03,319
this is a farmer

744
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,319
and this is this is really complicated

745
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,919
maybe i'd like to add some some further

746
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,319
aspects to

747
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,240
these points

748
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,359
you have the opportunity if you enter

749
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,640
the

750
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:20,000
medical cannabis market to learn a lot

751
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,038
about cannabis about regulatory about

752
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,839
quality systems about distribution about

753
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,798
sales channels about so many aspects

754
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,359
that are super important for not only

755
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,000
the medical cannabis business

756
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:37,038
but also for the recreational

757
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,519
um uh yeah cannabis system

758
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,960
that will happen at some point so i

759
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,918
believe that some companies maybe this

760
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,319
is a bit cash intense but it might make

761
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,640
sense to

762
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,319
enter the market to

763
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,278
learn to get

764
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,720
exposed to the mechanisms because let's

765
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,558
face it the adult use market it will be

766
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,720
a regulated market

767
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,720
we need to accept that it will be highly

768
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,159
regulated and we discussed some of those

769
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,399
aspects in this morning what if the

770
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,200
point of sales is

771
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,319
license dispensaries but also pharmacies

772
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,679
what if

773
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:20,079
uh marketing for products is not allowed

774
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,278
those are all things that

775
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,918
uh in

776
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:23,919
a certain

777
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,519
form we already have

778
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,240
existent existence in the

779
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,679
medical market so i believe exposure

780
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,159
here

781
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,320
can be worth and for us as a company

782
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,880
we're in the industry

783
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:43,439
you said dinosaur for the yes

784
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,240
we are maybe dinosaurs from germany uh

785
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,880
when it comes to medical cannabis this

786
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,880
is a real value proposition that you

787
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,200
have because you have a team you have

788
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,880
processes you have the knowledge and all

789
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,159
this is probably

790
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,039
one of those

791
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,880
things

792
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,119
that are super important

793
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,200
for the recreational world as well

794
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:07,199
that's great and anyway do you have any

795
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,240
thoughts on um yeah i think that

796
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,000
the cannabis market is um

797
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,159
no country there's absolutely nothing

798
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,319
transparent transferable

799
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,480
from territory to territory and i think

800
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,278
this is the challenge in europe that you

801
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,798
know

802
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,640
every single market is handling

803
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,398
differently but i think that you also

804
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,360
really need to be operational on the

805
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:30,319
market to understand how to work within

806
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:33,278
the confines of the existing legislation

807
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,519
and um and quite a complicated and

808
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:38,319
restrictive supply chain

809
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,599
so um and i think that you know

810
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,038
ultimately also in the recreational

811
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,959
business um

812
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,720
supply chain and for those companies who

813
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,079
are already in the supply chain have

814
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,319
built

815
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,798
a distribution network this is going to

816
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,798
be really really important it might be

817
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,679
different distribution channels but at

818
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,839
least

819
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,000
they understand the supply chain

820
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,240
and when you say nothing is transferable

821
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,319
market to market what do you mean

822
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,798
by nothing is transferrable market to

823
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,398
market because the the the

824
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,839
the legislative frameworks are

825
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,119
completely different in every european

826
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,359
country

827
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,558
um and

828
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,479
how

829
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,000
the license the imports and the gmp jsp

830
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,240
the products all goes into the

831
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,798
formulation and so so it's it's it's

832
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,038
very different to to to each market

833
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,720
um so that's what i what happened with

834
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,759
underscore that's that's a fascinating

835
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,558
topic to me because uh the united states

836
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,119
obviously is split up by by sovereign

837
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,240
jurisdiction over 50 states uh and each

838
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,798
state does it differently and

839
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,399
furthermore unlike europe you can't

840
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,319
put cannabis in the trunk of your car

841
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,719
and drive across the state line without

842
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,558
risking getting arrested right um so

843
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,000
europe is in some sense going to develop

844
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,240
a little bit like the united states i

845
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,599
think if it's okay to say that um but in

846
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
some ways it's going to develop i think

847
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,678
in a more exciting way with greater

848
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,360
interaction between jurisdictions so i

849
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,600
think sony at that point

850
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,119
it's worth exploring i think um that

851
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,599
where we're at exactly things are gonna

852
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,959
fall because of course you're right uh

853
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,798
markets market is going to be very

854
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,480
different but unlike the united states

855
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,480
you're going to be able to have

856
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,720
operations that distribute cannabis to

857
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,558
different territories within europe

858
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,240
way sooner than that's going to happen

859
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,678
in the united states which will require

860
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,159
federal legalization in the united

861
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,360
states so on that note maybe martin will

862
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,640
come to you weighing this one at you

863
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,839
first but this really is again for the

864
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,000
whole panel

865
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,678
if i'm a company outside the united

866
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,679
states outside of europe and i'm looking

867
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,440
to enter leverage from africa from from

868
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,960
anywhere else uh

869
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,360
where do i want to set up my holding

870
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,399
company what country do i want to be in

871
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,278
uh

872
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,038
and launch operations from which to to

873
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,240
send cannabis out to the other european

874
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:45,440
territories

875
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,038
in germany

876
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,600
yeah no

877
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,119
there's not one answer apparently um but

878
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,558
definitely i mean

879
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,359
there are a couple players with the

880
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,960
holding structure also in germany

881
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,678
and i think the couple of

882
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,079
aspects are important substance and

883
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,320
where is your focus this is not only

884
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:07,038
relevant for tax purposes so even if you

885
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,759
have a holding structure under the

886
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,839
european regulations the european

887
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,240
guidelines you have text of preferential

888
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,319
text treatment in a group but also then

889
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,480
you need to have substance

890
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,200
in the individual group entities you

891
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,360
cannot say it's just a shell or it's an

892
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,679
it's a post box this doesn't work

893
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,798
anymore you know it's like 20 years ago

894
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,600
and

895
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,038
and

896
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,038
therefore i'm

897
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,960
i think

898
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,839
germany would be would be a good start

899
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,440
and

900
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,839
if you have your substance in your focus

901
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,759
there if you want to control the group

902
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,558
from germany then germany is your place

903
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,679
to be also for for the for the holding

904
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:48,158
but if you are based in the uk or if you

905
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,080
are based in if you are original from

906
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,278
originally from north macedonia north

907
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,639
macedonia and you have a plan there

908
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,960
not a problem to have the holding

909
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,038
company there we've spoken to sanya

910
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,558
there are also groups that have their

911
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,079
holding companies

912
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,200
offshore

913
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:09,199
not really but in tax um

914
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,000
preferred countries like cyprus um malta

915
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,398
and

916
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,199
also the netherlands we know have a very

917
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,679
a rather low tax and corporate tax rate

918
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,158
also the uk and ireland have a low tax

919
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,480
rate so tax can be a driver but it

920
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,720
doesn't help you if your substance is

921
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,599
somewhere else because then it will just

922
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,279
um

923
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,919
put you really it will put you into

924
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,519
trouble and because then you may risk if

925
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,279
you have a permanent establishment

926
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,079
abroad and

927
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,200
if these are the two so where substance

928
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,240
and do you have a permanent

929
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,439
establishment um a fictitious permanent

930
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,878
establishment

931
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,039
a problem or

932
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,358
the wrong one in another country that

933
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,159
will put you into tax trouble so and

934
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,598
therefore um in in this regard i can

935
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,878
only advise

936
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,960
substance

937
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,279
um look at your organization where are

938
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,240
the people you want to you want to hire

939
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,960
what is an attractive market um

940
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,919
what is maybe the first place for your

941
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,720
product roll out and and then put this

942
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,519
all in a reasonable compliance regime

943
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:14,000
don't stop with the regulatory filings

944
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,639
also include a corporate compliance

945
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,880
system because otherwise you know um in

946
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,199
the journey it's particularly strict if

947
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,119
you don't have a compliance system you

948
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,639
are committing an offense if you are a

949
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,000
manager and you're not looking after the

950
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:30,799
system you can say this by my

951
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,960
minus two manager did that mistake i'm

952
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,839
responsible for what's going on in the

953
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,119
business and and that's that's basically

954
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,960
so we have a lot of flexibility um

955
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,599
but but these are the aspects i would i

956
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,480
would put in the center

957
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,599
um maybe i add some some color or

958
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,039
comments on

959
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,800
what we also discussed just before that

960
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:56,880
particular question with regards to

961
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,280
harmonization of eu regulatory

962
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,240
frameworks and also what you mentioned

963
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,320
cross-border and trade because what we

964
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,319
see already in the medical market is

965
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,480
that there is a product flow from

966
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,880
denmark to germany from germany to

967
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,400
poland from spain to germany from

968
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,119
portugal nevertheless whatever to

969
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,519
germany so we have a existing cross

970
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,000
border trade already and that's when

971
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,880
talking to u.s folks that's pretty

972
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,960
exciting i think and this is also a huge

973
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,358
opportunity and chance when we're

974
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,480
talking about the recreational system

975
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,119
because

976
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,639
harmonizing it across europe is probably

977
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,559
crucial

978
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,719
to to make it right

979
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,639
otherwise we may

980
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,039
end in a situation where we have

981
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,159
individual solutions in individual

982
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,400
countries and this will definitely not

983
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,759
not work out and at the same time it

984
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,559
gives us already in a existing medical

985
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,280
world quite a taste of how

986
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,159
a

987
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,160
inner european ecosystem and supply

988
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,799
chains could look like and that's pretty

989
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,920
exciting and here i actually disagree a

990
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,079
bit

991
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,119
with your statement that

992
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,920
things are not transferable

993
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,800
between territories i believe we already

994
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,519
have in the pharmaceutical world quite a

995
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,400
harmonized system as i said trade is

996
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:21,759
possible and a joint goal of the

997
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,119
european union should be to

998
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,400
adapt to that and adjust it and also

999
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,680
make a harmonized recreational system in

1000
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,440
the future

1001
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,039
possible

1002
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,200
very good thank you and i'm going to

1003
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,800
have a final question i want to leave a

1004
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,919
few minutes for questions from the

1005
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,000
audience here this is going to be an

1006
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,320
open question for the panel we talked

1007
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,079
about entering european market by way of

1008
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,760
setting up company

1009
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,839
what about through investment do you

1010
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,160
have any advice from folks looking into

1011
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,519
your from other parts of the world that

1012
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,358
want that are considering entering the

1013
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,920
market through a substantial investment

1014
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,759
into an existing uh or soon to be

1015
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,519
launched uh cannabis company in the

1016
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,520
european market that's open for the for

1017
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,519
the group here sonya or anyone else

1018
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,440
and we have already several companies

1019
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,920
producing medical canada in spain i

1020
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,000
think the first company started growing

1021
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,519
i started producing canvas

1022
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,960
in spanish like

1023
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,639
seven years ago and you have absolutely

1024
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,599
security to

1025
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,598
run your

1026
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,359
your business and now as things have

1027
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,960
become more like

1028
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,519
friendly in

1029
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,280
europe the spanish medical agency is

1030
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,559
making it easier to

1031
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,359
to get a lesson to produce cannabis and

1032
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,838
why would be a good idea to come to

1033
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,519
spain to produce

1034
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:48,639
cannabis there is a low cost of

1035
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,920
production

1036
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:54,400
we have and as everybody knows excellent

1037
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,200
climate to out to

1038
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,680
outdoor cultivation and i wanna remember

1039
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:03,118
everyone has the brightest price

1040
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:06,000
electricity going so that's a disappoint

1041
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,519
rapid approval process and opportunity

1042
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,960
for first

1043
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,000
mover

1044
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,800
advantage at the market is poised to

1045
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,880
open up after investigations very soon

1046
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,000
and the market is not crowded

1047
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,760
at all yet

1048
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,159
so there's just like four main

1049
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,880
requirements to realizing to grow

1050
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,719
in spain you need a loi you have to sign

1051
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,720
a loi with a medical

1052
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,719
company

1053
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,680
in spain also you have to obviously to

1054
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,838
provide that and the seats or the clones

1055
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,719
you want to work with are

1056
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:43,759
certified clones or seats and just a

1057
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:46,078
security plan and an engineer engineer

1058
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,359
project that's all we can expect to

1059
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,680
become a

1060
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,440
cannabis medical producer

1061
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,759
so anything we

1062
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,760
could have

1063
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,160
maybe try to add some

1064
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,199
ideas on how i would look

1065
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:06,399
into a potential in investment so i

1066
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,399
would really look at what is the vision

1067
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,599
what is the team

1068
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,960
what is the operational track record

1069
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,838
um and if those three items somehow

1070
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,880
match together and i would believe that

1071
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:23,838
this team is capable to really drive the

1072
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,559
cannabis industry then i would believe

1073
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,480
those are good indicators

1074
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,920
for for a

1075
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,000
potential

1076
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,000
investment

1077
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,400
couldn't make a bit more

1078
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,920
just just maybe to act if you have if

1079
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,200
you have an international structure if

1080
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,440
you have a large player on the banker um

1081
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:47,199
easier to invest because you know you

1082
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,358
can make use of cost advantages to the

1083
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,118
the the expensive dollar at the moment

1084
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,039
so and you have

1085
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,480
a longer value chain so you have more

1086
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,079
flexibility

1087
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,639
um but

1088
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,560
another tip is only invest in what you

1089
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,480
understand and the german market

1090
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,039
generally the market that is a complex

1091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,719
picture so if you invest

1092
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,039
speak to other investors co-invest

1093
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,358
with with other smaller funds that have

1094
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,358
already been invested in that company

1095
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,279
ask them look at the due diligence they

1096
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,598
have done you don't have to do your own

1097
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,440
due diligence you know

1098
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,039
very good and uh with that uh we'll

1099
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,280
leave a few questions from the audience

1100
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,279
here

1101
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,480
all right

1102
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,920
you got your hand up right away

1103
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,000
please keep your questions to the first

1104
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,318
four rows so i don't have to walk too

1105
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,079
far i'm kidding

1106
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:44,960
hi uh recording from macmillan's

1107
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,960
listeners in london just a question

1108
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,639
regarding

1109
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,079
allegiance between all european

1110
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,639
countries when it comes to

1111
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,880
recreation which benefit you were

1112
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,639
mentioning i can see that happening for

1113
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,760
germany because germany has gotten

1114
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,400
advanced

1115
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,079
medicinal space but don't you see there

1116
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,599
being a problem this is open to all the

1117
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,599
panels

1118
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,760
by having a recreational market in the

1119
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,318
rest of europe where their medicinal

1120
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,720
market has yet to develop don't we run

1121
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:16,159
the risk of cannibalizing the medicinal

1122
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,000
market with a recreational market that's

1123
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,920
my question

1124
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,358
you know i'll actually uh take a shot at

1125
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,680
that just because i think there are

1126
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,279
lessons to be learned from how we screw

1127
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,078
things up in the united states in some

1128
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,200
respects so so i'll take it from that

1129
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,960
perspective

1130
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,519
i was just having a conversation with a

1131
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,199
new friend just maybe two hours ago when

1132
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,039
we were talking about how in the united

1133
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,960
states there was a shift in focus from

1134
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,559
the medicinal market to the recreational

1135
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,720
market and that's sensational in many

1136
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,239
respects and it's very exciting

1137
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:45,519
i've been very excited about that and

1138
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,199
still am but there was something that

1139
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,358
was lost too which was the medicinal

1140
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:52,559
conversation it got lost in the united

1141
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,639
states and that indicates that obviously

1142
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,078
uh legalizing the recreational level and

1143
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,078
that is a significant loss because

1144
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,318
there's so much technology that god put

1145
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,640
into this plant and we really don't

1146
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,800
understand and and through all the work

1147
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,920
on juvenile science nerds so we actually

1148
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,160
love that stuff uh and love hearing how

1149
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,079
this stuff not only alleviates the pain

1150
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,318
of cancer patients for instance but

1151
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,720
actually may help fight cancer i mean

1152
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:19,920
that is just an amazing statement that

1153
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,239
we have exploited and it is a wtf sort

1154
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,039
of moment where you realize we just

1155
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,799
forgot to really focus on that as a

1156
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,000
nation and so i would love to see things

1157
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,440
developed differently here in europe

1158
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,639
where as you go to the recreational

1159
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,280
market it's great to be able to buy a

1160
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,199
drink to relax but it it is there is a

1161
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,040
danger so and i agree with you there's a

1162
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,480
danger that the medical conversation

1163
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,838
will be lost here as it was in the

1164
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,199
states and i think that would be very

1165
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,039
sad for the whole world because this

1166
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,598
this plan can do much more than helping

1167
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,279
to relax it is medicinal it's medicine

1168
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,039
and so thank you for the opportunity

1169
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,880
just to talk about something we screwed

1170
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:54,070
up in the us and i i hope our friends in

1171
00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:00,429
europe get it more right than we did

1172
00:43:54,070 --> 00:44:00,429
[Applause]

1173
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,559
my question is what is your advice for

1174
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,119
learning american markets to access

1175
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,199
european markets and

1176
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,079
what is your vision on the atlantic

1177
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,078
american markets

1178
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:20,399
maybe i take that one so

1179
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,639
first of all the question

1180
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,680
would be what is your business model you

1181
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,920
want to bring

1182
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,679
isu cannabis into the german and

1183
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,519
european market

1184
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,960
then my question would be

1185
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:32,880
do you want to

1186
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,559
do everything on your own meaning

1187
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,519
building your own assets building your

1188
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,239
own license sets and be a operational

1189
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,079
company in the

1190
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,919
target market or not

1191
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,200
if the question is yes

1192
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,000
build it

1193
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,039
get

1194
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,920
the funds get the team and go for it

1195
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:54,318
if you want to go for a partnership

1196
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,960
approach having someone that can

1197
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,599
actually enable your market access can

1198
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,880
take care of the nitty-gritty stuff like

1199
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,920
distribution storage packaging

1200
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,720
yeah addressing the point of sales there

1201
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,318
are

1202
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,879
some very good

1203
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,639
companies that could help you um and

1204
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,838
assist you and give you this room to

1205
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,159
market

1206
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,400
and obviously this is

1207
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,559
one key activity of one of our business

1208
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,160
units so we're very much

1209
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,159
doing this as a daily business

1210
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,160
hi guys i'm steve mckenzie

1211
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,000
germany taught me about the role in

1212
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,799
general and how it's going to develop in

1213
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,800
the medical also

1214
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,480
it's obviously a very big pharmaceutical

1215
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,118
producer and what are the pharmaceutical

1216
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,838
companies doing to support our

1217
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,599
roadblocks and and when it does become

1218
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,440
you know from medical and recreational

1219
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,920
whatever what do you think the role of

1220
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,559
pharmaceutical companies will be

1221
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,559
moving forward

1222
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,960
the rule

1223
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,800
the role

1224
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,599
what will they what can they do after it

1225
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,440
becomes recreational there's no need for

1226
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,800
the doctor to grow it

1227
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,519
so

1228
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,800
the

1229
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,199
like exciting part of it is that

1230
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,400
most of the companies in the

1231
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:19,919
pharmaceutical medical cannabis space

1232
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:24,318
are not big pharma traditional companies

1233
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,559
so like probably the leading companies

1234
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:27,599
they are not pharma companies from the

1235
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,838
background

1236
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,838
there is actually just maybe one or

1237
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:35,599
let's say two players in the german

1238
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:37,838
market that at least got some traction

1239
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,440
and have a pure traditional farmer

1240
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,559
background

1241
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,079
so i

1242
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,318
if i would look um to our competitors in

1243
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,440
the market i would assume as long as

1244
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:53,679
this is a valuable maybe profitable

1245
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:56,079
business why exiting it so my first

1246
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,318
statement would be that those that are

1247
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,240
engaged in the medical market already

1248
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,400
without a farmer background or a

1249
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,318
traditional farmer background they will

1250
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,318
stay and this is also something if you

1251
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,800
look into other

1252
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,039
countries like canada many companies had

1253
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,960
a medical background but not a

1254
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,119
traditional pharma background they

1255
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,358
stayed they added recreational

1256
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,800
activities and that's what i believe

1257
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,199
will also happen in germany and the

1258
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,000
second part is maybe

1259
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:23,039
the

1260
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,599
further

1261
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,838
traditional pharma companies are getting

1262
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:31,039
engaged in the market seeing this

1263
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:33,599
opportunity but maybe not in terms of

1264
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,558
manchester formulations but rather with

1265
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,960
very traditional finished products

1266
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,440
running through clinical trials having a

1267
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,280
real market authorization but that's

1268
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
like really the long-term game we're

1269
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,040
talking about years we're talking about

1270
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,480
ik protection we're talking about

1271
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,719
significant and

1272
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,559
heavy funds and this is probably the

1273
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,919
space where those traditional pharma

1274
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,559
companies have significant

1275
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,039
advantages compared to other companies

1276
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,920
that are engaged in space if i can i

1277
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,719
think consolidation will tell

1278
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,519
so

1279
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:10,239
they will buy as soon as this industry

1280
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:12,079
has developed they will not

1281
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,118
try to copy paste business models but

1282
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,119
they will

1283
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,079
do them they will unfold every day

1284
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,550
activity sooner or later

1285
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:26,409
great thank you all very much

1286
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:26,409
[Applause]
