this I didn't know it was going to be

13
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,119
this good what they mean by good is

14
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,520
information and networking and just the

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,718

25
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,200
information you can see the people kind

26
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:27,158
of go oh I hadn't thought about that

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
before it's raising a lot of

28
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,479
Consciousness about the social

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,040
percussions of prohibition and I'm not

30
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,519
sure that everybody here came in the

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,280
door worrying about that but more like

32
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,679
oh how can I make money or how can I fit

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,719
into the industry and I hear that

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,479
they're being inculcated with more and

35
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,319
more Progressive thought about why we're

36
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,640
doing this why we're fighting to end

37
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,599
prohibition so what's happening in in in

38
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,560
this situation right here is people are

39
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,239
a bit overwhelmed by the breadth of the

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,600
understanding that people have for one

41
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,118
another and empathy and and you know

42
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,640
this might sound like some hyy toyy uh

43
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,478
stuff to if you're if you're just a

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,280
businessman well I'm a businessman I do

45
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,759
well in the industry and I believe in

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,000
karma I believe in community I believe

47
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,239
in love and understanding and I actually

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,519
believe if you hold true to some of

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,878
those tenants and precepts that you're

50
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,280
only going to benefit yourself for so

51
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,039
many reasons and and in my case it's

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,878
actually helped me make money also so

53
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,560
it's this new win-win situation that's

54
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:30,280
happening uh with the Cannabis industry

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
uh in particular and I think that's what

56
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,080
people are very surprised about that

57
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,919
that they can make money they can be

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,680
successful and no one else has to to

59
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,399
lose all it's the fastest growing

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
business in America and I just want to

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,878
what we need to do I mean as all the

81
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,000
suits jump into the business we got to

82
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,318
remember to keep the hippie ideals right

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,438
uh I've always proceeded from the idea

84
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,839
that the hippies were right and I try to

85
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,120
let that guide my actions uh but this

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,640
was a great conference what's

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,319
question we've had an amazing weekend

88
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,079
here at the international cannabis

89
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,518
business conference you know when we

90
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,799
when we started doing this or when we

91
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,319
had the concept to come up with the

92
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,959
international cannabis business

93
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:58,479
conference uh of course businesses is in

94
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,878
the title however we wanted to do a

95
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,798
whole ton of ad eacy politics and

96
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,199
culture that's our that's uh our passion

97
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:06,799
that's what we were pushing and we were

98
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,679
curious of how people would react to it

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,920
there's so many other business

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,959
conferences out there that uh talk about

101
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,438
Investment Banking or penny stocks or

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,560
whatever and we thought if we did a

103
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,719
business conference that was not just

104
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,319
focusing on on business business

105
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,960
business and money money money we

106
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,279
thought we were actually taking a chance

107
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,799
and people might not groove on that or

108
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,159
not get what they expect for their

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,560
highend uh ticket price well uh what's

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,000
happened in fact is people are actually

111
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,360
overly excited and happy that we have

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,160
decided to dedicate so much of this to

113
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,759
culture politics and advocacy and I'm

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,880
tremendously happy with the

115
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,960
feedback never doubt a small group of

116
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,319
concerned citizens can change the world

117
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,038
