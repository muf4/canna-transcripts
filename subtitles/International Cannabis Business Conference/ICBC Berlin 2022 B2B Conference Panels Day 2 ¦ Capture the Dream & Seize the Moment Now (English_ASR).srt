1
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,840
i was right there to help companies

2
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,479
start getting licenses

3
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,159
we were also the first state to allow

4
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,959
adult use

5
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,680
prop 64 regulate marijuana-like alcohol

6
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,280
we passed that in 2012. first store is

7
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,959
open january 1st 2014.

8
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
it's almost a decade ago that we've

9
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
owned recreational cannabis stores in

10
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,559
colorado

11
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,639
did everything go to uh colorado's

12
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,039
still awesome we have more jobs less

13
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,359
minorities in prison less problems less

14
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,878
alcohol consumption

15
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
so we've definitely learned some lessons

16
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,679
of what not to do by 2014 then seeing

17
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
that the feds didn't rate us we started

18
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,159
working in many many other states and

19
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
then by 2014 with canada

20
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,000
started working there then germany then

21
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,679
denmark and now over 40 states 40

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,280
countries we've worked in

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,480
so i've been around seeing lots of

24
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
companies from cultivation to

25
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,679
manufacturing retail the internationals

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,680
that have eu gmp compliance and gacp

27
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,120
compared to state regulations in

28
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,239
oklahoma which

29
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,039
let's just say some of those aren't the

30
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,000
best laws state by state

31
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,079
so

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,878
blades of glory

33
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
two rivals that were skating and they

34
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,239
got in a fight that got kicked out of

35
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,000
the olympics in their class of skating

36
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
male single skating couldn't do it

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,199
anymore

38
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,199
one went out to be a burnout the other

39
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,399
was tying some shoes

40
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,158
and all of a sudden they realized there

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,599
was a little change in the regulations

42
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,199
that would allow them to compete in

43
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,518
another category

44
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,438
like paired finger stating so they they

45
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
launched to be the first male paired

46
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,199
figure skaters in the history of the

47
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,840
world and got to get to the olympics but

48
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,238
one was like you know pretty boy

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,319
uh jimmy the little blond guy

50
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,078
he was like raised to do this i see him

51
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,478
as like the canadian public companies

52
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,639
like i went to work and i know about m

53
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,319
a's and ipos and all these evaluations

54
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
and it could be for a chicken farm or

55
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,599
cannabis it doesn't matter but they came

56
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,478
from the pedigree they were raised to do

57
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,879
this

58
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,240
and then you got these outlaws like chas

59
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,000
michael michaels

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
who is pretty much ridiculous in doing

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,839
whatever those are like the legacy

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,280
operators like gangster power by any

63
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,279
means necessary didn't have the

64
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,559
resources in training but they they both

65
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,478
do beautiful things however

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720
they bonded together to capture the

67
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,319
dream which was a very beautiful kind of

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
sentiment to go on and like actually win

69
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,120
the world olympics as the first

70
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,918
not even ambiguously gay duo but like

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,840
blatantly awesome duo of skating so when

72
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,680
you look at some of these parallels at

73
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,839
least in my mind three months ago when

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,840
they wanted this presentation topic

75
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,279
um it was like right now everyone's just

76
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,359
freaking dreaming

77
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,359
dreams don't happen unless you

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
do something about it if you have a

79
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,479
great dream to do something you better

80
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,839
read the rules about what you're gonna

81
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,199
do put a team together have a plan just

82
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,319
because this is cannabis doesn't mean

83
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,319
you're going to be a millionaire or a

84
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,918
billionaire i mean i see companies that

85
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,560
do hundreds of millions of revenue that

86
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,639
are like losing money every month

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,199
canadian public companies msos all of

88
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,478
those and even private companies

89
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,160
there's all these different tax

90
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,519
regulations that you have to follow not

91
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,439
only in the united states where it's

92
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,599
federally illegal we can't deduct our

93
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,839
business costs our ebitda should be like

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,759
5 million it's like 1 million

95
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,359
so understanding all of these parameters

96
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,600
if you've got a dream how to take a

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,240
dream and a vision and make it something

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
is what i love to help companies do but

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,519
i see that most companies fail because

100
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,079
they're always like dreaming i could do

101
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,599
this or that and they don't have a focus

102
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,639
the focus for the companies is most

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,639
important

104
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
so when we look at the global

105
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,319
cannabis market it's constantly evolving

106
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,159
a couple more new colors there it's

107
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
happening time by time when we're

108
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
talking about like the entire us and

109
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,719
global industry of legal cannabis last

110
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,038
year about 35 billion us dollars in

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,639
revenue when you think that 88 of that

112
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,120
was in the united states

113
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,240
which is federally illegal and state by

114
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,759
state it's like we're almost different

115
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,400
countries

116
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,038
you got canada doing 90 is a legal

117
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,318
medical and adult use industry

118
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,000
interpol

119
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
nobody mess with them no one's messed

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,399
with uruguay yet

121
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,758
and then the rest of the world this is

122
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,959
of you

123
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,879
medical adult use

124
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,879
less than one percent i mean even

125
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,959
germany last year almost 350 million in

126
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,120
medical cannabis that's freaking awesome

127
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,758
helping patients have less suffering

128
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
healthcare's covering it's incredible

129
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,720
it's like testing the waters on a market

130
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,240
but colorado 6 million people close to 3

131
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,120
billion in revenue

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,319
germany 90 billion 90 million

133
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,519
like 350 million in revenue we're all

134
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
people and things are going to start to

135
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,359
change especially as the rules start to

136
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,519
allow to change but when you're in the

137
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
united states every little state is a

138
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,639
country and i can't grow things in one

139
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,960
place and move it to another so it's

140
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
super inefficient i have a different god

141
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,560
or government i have to serve in each

142
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,198
place some states will allow hundreds of

143
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
licenses some will give five but getting

144
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,598
market share in these new markets just

145
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,240
like international it's a real estate

146
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:36,399
land grab because commonly for your site

147
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,000
master files or for your qa qc programs

148
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,239
you have to have real estate that's

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,160
compliant that the owner will allow in a

150
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,478
city that said yes that's not too close

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,319
to a daycare or a church that's going to

152
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,918
have to have power and water and all of

153
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,680
these different services

154
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,680
but real estate is one of the secrets to

155
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
like finding these little places to go

156
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,038
because you could grow cannabis anywhere

157
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
it's a weed we've grown cannabis and

158
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,719
greenhouses all the way up in alaska all

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,478
the way down to south africa

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
middle of the world

161
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,240
you can do this anywhere but how much is

162
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,519
it going to cost you to do it somewhere

163
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
how much environmental and social

164
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,719
benefit is going to happen there and

165
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,038
what are the tax treaties and

166
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,039
regulations between countries from where

167
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,038
the money comes from where the money

168
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,560
goes how you bank it

169
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,639
these are things that are not as easy as

170
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
most people think

171
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,000
now the united states you know from

172
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,479
wisconsin

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,079
sorry just in advance

174
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,159
not everyone in america is like you see

175
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,680
on tv nowadays you know um there's still

176
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,280
some good ones left

177
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,038
we can still have women vote they can

178
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,399
have credit cards still you know there's

179
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,278
still some things

180
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,958
these can still get married uh

181
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,559
you know we'll check in on that in four

182
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,359
years fingers crossed but with weed

183
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,599
um

184
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,879
no current federal bills axe attempts to

185
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
do anything in the united states are

186
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,559
going to pass now it's really good for

187
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
stock prices when it's like oh the

188
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,479
moraps move forward great not gonna

189
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,039
happen

190
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,879
so more acts care mace

191
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,039
safe banking like they're all needed i'm

192
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,039
not against any of that but right now we

193
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,240
have such a divided house

194
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,079
and when you think about the economy uh

195
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,039
linguist background like economy is uh

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,120
oiganomos from greece like i know most

197
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,278
of the rules of the laws and

198
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,278
uh oikos is the house so the rules that

199
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,000
govern the house it's like what economy

200
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,720
is and our economy allows these little

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,399
state light things similar to the eu but

202
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,759
we don't have like weird sanctions or if

203
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,600
one state does something naughty we're

204
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,838
gonna like remove them from swift

205
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,720
banking or something like that

206
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
um that'd be interesting actually

207
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,519
but when you're thinking about all these

208
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,079
states and when it started with a few

209
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,120
there's only a few holdouts we've got

210
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
over a thousand bills nearly to legalize

211
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
in different programs it's going to

212
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,919
happen but we were the ones that caused

213
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,160
this show around the world in the

214
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,799
30s with some of our corporations that

215
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,838
were paper oil cotton

216
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,919
they're the ones who kind of work

217
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,279
together to make cannabis illegal just

218
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,719
to go after him

219
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,958
which is you know we've only been able

220
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,399
to do hemp in america since 2014 and

221
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,838
that was a show of a program the

222
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,679
first few years

223
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,279
but state by state is it's coming like

224
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,039
california you're going to do 5 billion

225
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,120
in revenue this year colorado probably

226
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,278
three oregon and washington a billion

227
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,639
and a half each some of these new states

228
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:17,679
like new york new jersey coronavirus we

229
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,679
went from 10 adult youth states to 20.

230
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,639
because they're like tax revenue jobs i

231
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,078
don't care

232
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,159
it's like this is going to bring in so

233
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,838
much more new economy and it's the right

234
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,679
thing to do like on a social justice

235
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,360
standpoint but we've gotten to be guinea

236
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,958
pigs in each one of these states

237
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,639
different departments of agriculture

238
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,958
departments of health telling us what we

239
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,240
could do what we couldn't do

240
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,078
we're trying to figure out that right

241
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,759
thing but we already figured out what do

242
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,958
people like and there are people that

243
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,958
are different in europe from like the

244
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,719
things you like like you like good bread

245
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,759
americans don't like good bread because

246
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,360
there's not any good bread in the

247
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,078
country i don't know how that's the case

248
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
but

249
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,759
you know there's different taste

250
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,278
concerns in countries when it comes to

251
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,679
it's not just flour anymore it's not

252
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,600
just hatch with tobacco but consumer

253
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,199
packaged goods are changing the way that

254
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,480
this industry is going to be it's gotta

255
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
have a barcode

256
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
so the companies of ours here that do

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
soil to oil cultivation and

258
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,160
manufacturing co-located we don't sell

259
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,640
wholesale pounds 500 kilos here 500

260
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,319
kilos there everything's in a single one

261
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,078
gram three and a half gram seven gram

262
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,200
package every edible is child safe

263
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,039
and then that's where you make the

264
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
massive revenue but what you can learn

265
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,679
from the united states what products are

266
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,600
working and not when it comes to

267
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,519
beverages and others what will your

268
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
countries allow in the future

269
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
or you're gonna do a giant vape line in

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
europe well europe's based on the api

271
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
and medical right now other than the

272
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,240
swiss path program you couldn't even do

273
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,720
a product really so you have to know

274
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,399
those rules and what you can do

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
so what can we learn from the united

276
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,480
states and canada

277
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
canada um

278
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,320
long story there

279
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,078
like to actually do this well and like

280
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
jimmy you say it's like if you can dream

281
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,599
it you can do it well that's not

282
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,519
actually the case it takes tons of

283
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,519
people to put this stuff together tens

284
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,959
of millions of euros of times to do this

285
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,159
stuff and that's sometimes just to get

286
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,439
started

287
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,278
so when you think of what products

288
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,120
worked in america what's worked from

289
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,439
regulations what pesticide testing

290
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,519
packaging what were the problems we had

291
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,560
in a poll in europe for adult use the

292
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,919
biggest concern is about child access

293
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,719
we've actually seen

294
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,958
teen access go down and consumption go

295
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
down in legal states because it's not

296
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,119
cool anymore like in america

297
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,278
i could get shot from my country i could

298
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,078
buy a house have a gun

299
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,679
get married pay taxes smoke cigarettes

300
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,838
buy porn

301
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,359
uh can't rent a car until you're 25 but

302
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,519
you can't drink beer alcohol or wine

303
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
until you're 21.

304
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,799
so then here it's like 18 is different

305
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
16 is different for beer but like

306
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,399
drinking is so cool to teens in america

307
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,838
because they can't do it

308
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,919
but then once it's like your parents are

309
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,839
smoking weed and you're like oh it's

310
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,799
not that cool anymore there's no folks

311
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
do it

312
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,039
but it still does happen so

313
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,039
no matter what you do in europe really

314
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,278
good educational programs for like youth

315
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,799
access substance abuse education you're

316
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,039
an advocate in this industry you're no

317
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,639
longer just like i got a business

318
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,639
everyone looks at what you do from your

319
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,320
packaging your labeling the messaging

320
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,839
that you have for this

321
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
you know who you support from substance

322
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,560
abuse education the trainings that

323
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,800
you're gonna do

324
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,199
so so important also like you don't need

325
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,958
pesticides to produce this even if you

326
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,839
don't have to follow a standard if you

327
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,919
do like gmp or eu gmp or gacp for

328
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,320
cultivation you're already setting them

329
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,319
like doing all this risk mitigation

330
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
less risk is better for the investment

331
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,560
and you're higher likely to succeed so

332
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,639
do the things even if you don't have to

333
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,759
do them right away because it will not

334
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,519
limit you from selling to another market

335
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,360
so you know i went over a little bit of

336
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
this the other day but internationally

337
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
the big problem with international

338
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,360
medical cannabis and as a medical

339
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,240
cannabis patient myself is that the

340
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,000
united states doctors write

341
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,519
recommendations they don't write

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,278
prescriptions for cannabis because

343
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,198
that's through the fda the food and drug

344
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,078
administration they're a federal

345
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,679
organization this is federally illegal

346
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,838
the only prescriptions that doctors can

347
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,000
do there for like apodex

348
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
satellites dronabinol

349
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,958
the synthetic cannabinoids that are all

350
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,439
poisoned

351
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,278
but they write for like recommendations

352
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,199
based in some states it's not everything

353
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,399
california anything your doctor thinks

354
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,639
cannabis could be helpful for you can

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,639
get a medical card i broke my wrist when

356
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,120
i was 14 skateboarding it hurts i can't

357
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
sleep oh here's your medical card others

358
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
like do you have a weird disease that i

359
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,320
can barely pronounce

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,839
and two doctors that say you haven't

361
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,560
okay now you can have medical cannabis

362
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,639
but only five percent thc oil here or

363
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,399
there like each state's so so different

364
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
but we need doctor education around the

365
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
world we've been stigmatizing this plan

366
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,959
for so long so no matter what you are or

367
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,120
where you are don't ever like

368
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,278
go so flowery to sales like canvas cures

369
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,440
this and that like

370
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,198
cannabis has been shown to

371
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,120
and we need a lot more medical studies

372
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,719
and a big thing that happened through

373
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,959
the commission for narcotic drugs the

374
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,360
world made um world health organization

375
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,198
and the u.n that re-rescheduled cannabis

376
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,199
in december of 2020

377
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,838
to be similar to the us's schedule three

378
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,159
like has medical value needs more

379
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,399
research in america schedule one

380
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,759
narcotic we're heroin cannabis is the

381
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,240
exact same no medical needs no more

382
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,240
study needed just the devil so

383
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,278
internationally cannabis isn't the devil

384
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
anymore

385
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,679
it has medical efficacy needs more

386
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,959
studies if we change that in the united

387
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,479
states irc 280 that tax code that really

388
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,000
kills our industry

389
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,519
goes away overnight because that's only

390
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
applicable to schedule one and schedule

391
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,519
who narcotics when you see that happen

392
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
by every single

393
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
mso that's in the united states in a

394
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,399
public company standpoint

395
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,000
we've got to do education we've got to

396
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,159
get more doctors understanding the needs

397
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,360
for this and trying this and using this

398
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,039
that's why patient counts are so so low

399
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,959
adult use is starting

400
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,559
you know it's happening in canada

401
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,758
happening in america happening in

402
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,198
uruguay

403
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,000
other places in europe are starting to

404
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,599
allow this why hasn't it happened yet

405
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,519
and one of the big issues here is

406
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,079
standing in germany deutschland's

407
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,399
biggest gdp in the eu awesome

408
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,719
almost what four trillion

409
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,839
pretty gangster almost 90 million people

410
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,959
like what you do here europe will follow

411
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,639
and now that you're not competing with

412
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,958
the uk so much like whole brexit then

413
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,959
we're not going to get into that

414
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,879
but um

415
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,198
germany you have the ability to be like

416
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,480
the trendsetter like the prettiest girl

417
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,000
at the bar

418
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,159
if you figure this out right are you

419
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,559
going to most likely not

420
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,278
because bummer it's not your fault it's

421
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,000
just

422
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,679
who your parents are aka the eu so we've

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,198
got all of these international drug

424
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,879
compacts that bob hogan and others

425
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,799
talked about yesterday the single treaty

426
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,639
1961 from the united nations on

427
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,240
psychotropic substances

428
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,360
indian pharmacies act all of these

429
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
different things

430
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,440
canada is in blatant violation of that

431
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,278
uruguay is in blatant violation of that

432
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,519
all of the medical programs under those

433
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,240
are doing compassionate use programs

434
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,879
which means it can only be medical api

435
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,198
active pharmaceutical ingredients flour

436
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,198
oil compounding happens in pharmacies

437
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,159
you're not selling cookies or vape

438
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,838
cartridges you can do part a part b you

439
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,720
know

440
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,078
standardization but when we think about

441
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,279
like what are all these things can be

442
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,959
these are a lot of questions that we

443
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,038
normally typically try to figure out and

444
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
answer but the issue with germany is

445
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,720
that you're in the eu and the eu has

446
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,198
different sanctions and provisions from

447
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
member nations so you can pretty much do

448
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,880
this to the uh everyone's doing that

449
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,679
right now no one's doing minus

450
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,600
russia but that's different thing

451
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
also very unfortunate

452
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,599
um

453
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
but then you're also gonna have to think

454
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,359
of what's gonna happen not only in your

455
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,798
country in some of the cantons like in

456
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,240
switzerland or within certain

457
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,160
municipalities and what's going to

458
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
happen and the easiest way they see it

459
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,120
to do this is through like

460
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,720
the home grill which as a farmer and

461
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,399
being in this space like something's

462
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
legal people should be able to grow it

463
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,519
are people going to make moonshine yeah

464
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,519
are people going to make extra beer and

465
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,599
salad yeah is it going to be significant

466
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,359
abso literally not it's me like

467
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,359
this much how many you all could brew

468
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,199
beer right now and grew wine how many

469
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,079
people have carboys at home

470
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,400
wash those put the priming sugar in you

471
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,000
know yeah not many but how many people

472
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,240
had wine last night

473
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,839
we're lazy cannabis is it takes four to

474
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
six months to grow it you gotta dry it

475
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,798
you gotta cure it you got all those

476
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,159
things and it's great that people do it

477
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,319
and it's medicine you've been growing

478
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,240
and seeing a plant and helping that i've

479
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,200
seen that massively helpful for veterans

480
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,720
but

481
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,038
if we legalize it that way it's going to

482
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,480
start a program of more illicit market

483
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,160
and then it's going to be harder to rail

484
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
that in later so if they do the right

485
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
thing early it's going to be very very

486
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
nice

487
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,240
when you think about it i threw on the

488
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,079
team america world police on this one

489
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,079
too just you know

490
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,599
america but we've got stuff we've got to

491
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,119
deal with like the united nations the

492
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,759
commission for narcotic drugs the world

493
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,599
health organization the eu eu then with

494
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,119
europol oh we got interpol we got all

495
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,038
this money sitting up in london we can't

496
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,399
do right now even though they went

497
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,440
like rage and pillaged the world for

498
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,798
like

499
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,120
half a

500
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,319
thousand years and then now of all it's

501
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,000
well sitting there that they can't

502
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,000
actually invest into like things because

503
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,519
the proceeds of foreign crimes act in

504
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,119
2002

505
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,798
they can't even invest in real estate in

506
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,798
america that we lease to a cannabis

507
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,639
company so they can only invest certain

508
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,240
proceeds into like other legal things

509
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,160
that are legal in their country which is

510
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,519
mostly cbd type things

511
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,880
but when you think about all these

512
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,558
regulators and things you have to worry

513
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,840
about not that team america is a

514
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,720
regulator but

515
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,639
you know

516
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,480
they like to act like it but since we

517
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,759
were the that did this whole

518
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,079
thing internationally we're not going to

519
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,679
be the first to say like we're sorry

520
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,918
cannabis should have never been illegal

521
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,600
well we're gonna do this right we're

522
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,880
gonna take the ip and companies will be

523
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,798
leaders from the us and what they've

524
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,480
done but we will be one of the latest to

525
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,918
adopt this

526
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,038
and always that crystal ball question

527
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,120
how many years until federal

528
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,400
legalization of the united states

529
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,599
five to nine years

530
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,360
i've been saying for five to nine years

531
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,480
and based on who our last president was

532
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,558
which he shall not be named um nothing's

533
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
gonna happen current administration just

534
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,599
a great bill from biden the other day to

535
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,640
actually like take certain people out of

536
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,558
jail

537
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,559
but not about not putting more new

538
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,759
people in there

539
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,359
international

540
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,960
narcotics control board is definitely

541
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,479
pissed about everything that's going on

542
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,558
especially when it comes to like all

543
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,960
these vape cartridges new cannabinoids

544
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,038
people doing isolates isolating

545
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,038
something from nature versus just like

546
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,240
full distillates if you isolate

547
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,279
something from nature and you try to

548
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,200
make an api that's 562 million dollars

549
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,240
of clinical trials to get a standardized

550
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,080
drug

551
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
even if i took beta-carotene out of a

552
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,720
carrot and i was going to make a

553
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,038
supplement or something for that or a

554
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,798
pharmaceutical drug half a bill

555
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,640
just to do that so always use the word

556
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,119
distillate not isolate

557
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,559
um there's yeah we're in this gray area

558
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,839
where there's all this new learning all

559
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:35,519
this new science but there's no

560
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,079
regulators really cracking down other

561
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,119
than on the blatantly illicit market

562
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,879
and when you're thinking about what are

563
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,319
the possibilities in this place like are

564
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,600
people going to like wheat in europe

565
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,200
it's going to be a whole different roll

566
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,519
out for how you live here or when you're

567
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,080
thinking

568
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:53,359
467 billion in 2022 in alcohol sales

569
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,720
that's almost half a trillion euros

570
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,158
and normally that'd be like a lot more

571
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,759
but like the dollar in the euro you know

572
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,840
about the same right now which is

573
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,839
awesome for us sorry for you

574
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,119
you

575
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,599
know normally they'd be like i'm like oh

576
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,558
god 467 billion euros oh my god it's

577
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,639
like 600 650 million dollars oh my god

578
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,319
it's the same now but

579
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,880
that's a huge market share and that's

580
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,319
not something that's poison

581
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,919
we allow alcohol but we don't want

582
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,599
cannabis anybody seen a drunk person in

583
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,799
a stone person not saying one's better

584
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,798
than the other but

585
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,119
damn the problems that alcohol causes to

586
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,440
society over what cannabis like helps to

587
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,519
like treat and make better

588
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,000
alcohol and then you've got tobacco

589
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,158
almost a quarter trillion

590
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,759
dollars a year and smoking's cool here

591
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
it's not in america anymore it's really

592
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,319
bummer but like all these new things

593
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,319
jewel got banned by the fda like those

594
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,839
little vape cartridge type things like

595
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,599
tobacco is still this weird thing it

596
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,519
built our country but also like kind of

597
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,038
killing the country when you think about

598
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,400
this market share and what's happened in

599
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,000
colorado

600
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,679
most of our data there's a lot of data

601
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,038
companies out there but long term we

602
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,440
project that there's going to be one

603
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,480
billion in revenue from every million

604
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,558
people

605
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,240
for cannabis and for every dollar spent

606
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,319
on cannabis there's about five dollars

607
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,079
of velocity of capital the real estate

608
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,158
the consulting the legal the packaging

609
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,960
the electricity the plumbers putting in

610
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,799
things like manufacturers in china

611
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,798
you buy cannabis you're contributing in

612
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,879
this whole other industry so even if we

613
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,960
say colorado's doing

614
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,480
three billion in revenue we're probably

615
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,440
doing like 12 billion of additional

616
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,759
economy 15 billion what would that look

617
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,000
like here because eliza cannabis exists

618
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,319
here now it's just not being taxed

619
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,400
tested regulated that's what creates the

620
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,079
problems with this

621
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,679
massive opportunities will be the second

622
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,918
largest adult use market in the world

623
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,519
within five to ten years closer to the

624
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,000
10-year side when you think about

625
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,679
thanksgia for you know some slide but um

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,759
you know the eu with all the medical

627
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,519
it's really been happening well portugal

628
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,119
did something awesome by decriminalizing

629
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,720
drugs back in the day

630
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,839
not only did it allow you to buy a lot

631
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,360
of fake drugs in lisbon on

632
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,199
accident you know happens whenever

633
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:58,399
there's like oh people think that drugs

634
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,038
are legalized but there's a big

635
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,120
difference between decriminalization

636
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,960
legalization

637
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,479
you know rescheduling descheduling but

638
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
the medical programs have been starting

639
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
here but mostly i've let you down as

640
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,519
businesses because we don't have tons of

641
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
doctors writing prescriptions all over

642
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,440
the place that create the massive

643
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,759
demand that we need to actually

644
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,200
fuel these businesses that's why canopy

645
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,798
aurora all of these companies are

646
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,440
willing to take over the globe same time

647
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,480
we were working they spent so much money

648
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
on things that thought they would

649
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,798
generate revenues and returns two three

650
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,720
years out those were all four to seven

651
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,038
to ten year plans and they just got

652
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
burned like short squeezes

653
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,839
when you think about that and don't use

654
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,600
in europe kind of awesome you got the

655
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,359
netherlands you know coffee house thing

656
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,359
since the 70s that's gone through many

657
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,918
iterations it's not actually even legal

658
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,599
for non-residents to purchase their big

659
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,360
shout out to the dutch though because

660
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,839
like without them and they're breeding

661
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,639
back in the

662
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,319
70s we wouldn't have a lot of the

663
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,520
genetics that we have and it's sad to

664
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,200
see those companies aren't like

665
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,720
massively profitable like driscoll's

666
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,480
right now because they didn't do brand

667
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,759
licensing and like genetics breeding

668
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,360
rate stuff

669
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,798
but you know the netherlands had their

670
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,000
program and you've got this has the

671
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,319
program and the wheat experiment to

672
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,079
allow 10 to produce for 78 coffee houses

673
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,000
a few more there's over 500 coffee

674
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,599
houses in the netherlands each one on

675
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,440
average does 1.7 million dollars a year

676
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,480
i mean pretty significant and it's in

677
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
the country

678
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,120
for that spain has their club model with

679
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,038
like the medical club model also like

680
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,959
grey area ambiguity but it's

681
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,879
proliferating it started more and more

682
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,480
luxembourg introduced full legalization

683
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,919
all of that's gotten shot down and how

684
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,839
that's going to happen

685
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
germany how we're going to do it awesome

686
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:35,918
but like way to go otto way to go like

687
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,480
greens the social like everyone who kind

688
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,640
of made that happen gangster to

689
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,079
say that like this is amazing i'm

690
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,600
surprised jeremy was first i figured

691
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,798
malta would be

692
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,359
you're just the big one everyone's gonna

693
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,359
look at like portugal it's not legalized

694
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,599
it's decriminalized and that's all drugs

695
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,599
and they've had so fewer drug problems

696
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,359
with all drugs in their country because

697
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,278
they treat it as like an illness and

698
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,359
they help people instead of like put

699
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,519
them in prison take away their children

700
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,798
it's a really good model of drug control

701
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,038
malta's got that on their books in

702
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,319
switzerland has this pilot program for 5

703
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,919
000 patients people to consume in little

704
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,240
like club settings but they allow

705
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,440
products not just flour and oil it's the

706
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,599
same thing the netherlands the weed

707
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,038
experiment it was only flower

708
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,319
they didn't have like the edibles plant

709
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,200
yet we're going to do like netherlands

710
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,038
1.0 2.0 similar to canada but these are

711
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,558
the countries to really look at and pull

712
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,359
things that work from some of the others

713
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,960
but germany's got a lot of work ahead

714
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,158
so always like i'll say it's like to get

715
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,519
into this thing if you want to capture

716
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,200
the dream you got to know the rules to

717
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,359
play the game there's a lot of reading

718
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,798
to do in a lot of languages but the main

719
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,319
thing you wouldn't

720
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,079
like go to a casino with a million

721
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,519
dollars and like go play blackjack if

722
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,278
you didn't understand the rules or how

723
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,038
you would double down on things or i

724
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,240
don't gamble it's a tax on people that

725
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,319
are bad at math

726
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,000
but if you wouldn't go and like put a

727
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,158
bunch of money down and like do that

728
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
also what gambling legal kind of crazy

729
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,200
to me too

730
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,038
and gambling hates cannabis because we

731
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,159
don't make good gamblers like we get

732
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,599
distracted and we're not like yeah baby

733
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,799
like getting hammered like that's why

734
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,519
there's been so many problems in las

735
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,798
vegas getting this legal on the strip

736
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,798
but when you know the rules of like

737
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,720
what's the law allow what are the

738
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,558
standards i have to follow what are the

739
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,120
outside industry things that i need can

740
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,639
i even do my business plan where i'm

741
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,479
thinking about doing that business plan

742
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,919
does this country allow it

743
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,120
just because you have the idea that

744
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,799
you're gonna like get an extraction

745
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,479
license in portugal and make vape pens

746
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,480
and sell them all over the world

747
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,400
well not necessarily going to happen

748
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,798
unless it's a medical device compounded

749
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,798
and so forth but it's always from like

750
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,158
almost hindi meth like mythology you

751
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,000
have multiple different gods and you

752
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
gotta serve them all it's not just like

753
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
christian santa claus god just wanted to

754
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,200
keep him happy like you got national

755
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,440
international law your federal your

756
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
state or country municipalities your

757
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,440
counties all the way down to like little

758
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
boroughs and burgermeisters and it's got

759
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,038
to be compliant top down bottom up and

760
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,480
that's not just cannabis loss the

761
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,879
biggest thing i see having done

762
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,278
thousands of applications and businesses

763
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,120
winning the licenses i focus on because

764
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,359
it's number one but getting a license to

765
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,918
a building permit a certificate of

766
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,918
occupancy and starting the business

767
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,320
that's capital raising pre-construction

768
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,038
site planning engineering like oh

769
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,720
expensive and time and little things now

770
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
coronavirus has changed so many things

771
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,600
for supply chains everything you're

772
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,599
going to do

773
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,398
is going to right now two times as much

774
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,000
money and take twice as long

775
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,678
so in the past we used to just do new

776
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
buildings for everything but retrofits

777
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,200
are really starting to be much more

778
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,558
important

779
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
cannabis stocks are as low as they've

780
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,398
ever been right now some of them are

781
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
undervalued some are still overvalued

782
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:36,959
but

783
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,120
on a public or private standpoint this

784
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,440
industry we're out of gas even though

785
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,519
we're doing 35 billion in rev and all of

786
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,919
this services i can't get traditional

787
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,359
bank loans i can't get other things

788
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,759
so since we don't have institutional

789
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,199
capital how you raise private capital

790
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,599
how you deal with public capital we

791
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
manage funds do a lot of spvs i've seen

792
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,158
over a billion dollars of capital

793
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,558
deployed in the space some good some bad

794
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,919
but now more than ever

795
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,079
is like if you're thinking about getting

796
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,919
into this starting a business we have a

797
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,278
very short timeline that's like within

798
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,360
the next 10 years that this is all

799
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,798
established whoever gets those first

800
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,839
early market positions those are the

801
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,519
ones that are going to get the exits

802
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,038
that we hope for

803
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,119
a lot of them will stop though costs are

804
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,879
really high we have weird tax provisions

805
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,038
people are trying to figure out r d and

806
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,480
things on things that are already known

807
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,759
big advice

808
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,159
just like bob said this is an

809
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,679
agricultural commodity this is a

810
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,480
value-added product from consumer

811
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,840
packaged goods supplements

812
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,200
don't just think you're reinventing the

813
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,720
wheel on everything you're not going to

814
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,399
come up with some amazing new way of

815
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,079
cultivation the dutch with their

816
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:40,239
greenhouses and the venlos have figured

817
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,398
all this out a long time before use

818
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,679
their technology don't develop a new led

819
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,000
light that you think is going to do this

820
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,240
magic and your no

821
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,679
agriculture been around for like what 10

822
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
000 this year has been working pretty

823
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,120
well for us

824
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,480
pull from that you know indoor i've been

825
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,759
trying to put indoor out of business for

826
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,599
over a decade

827
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,278
it's so environmentally catastrophic

828
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,879
it's cheaper to build big four season

829
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,200
hybrid greenhouses that can still be

830
