1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
there are few people rare politicians

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,508
that actually fight for these freedoms

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,388
and our Mexican our keynote speaker is

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:14,190
someone who fights for this Liberty to

5
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:16,679
have fun freedom fun freedom fun freedom

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:19,410
nobody's hurting anybody so without

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,219
further ado I would like to bring to the

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,618
stage

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,049
the great one of the band who helped end

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,118
the Cold War and the man who has helped

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,719
end the drug war the number one ally in

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,450
Congress for cannabis industry please

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:48,420
give a warm Swank's and welcome to Dana

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:54,420
Rohrabacher I would really love to have

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:57,179
introductions like that well thank you

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,750
very much for any be with you this

17
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:05,040
morning then but this is this is quite

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,478
inspiring when I started discussing the

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,760
cannabis issue we would never be in

20
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,969
residence like this and we would be

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,618
having a walk in the woods someplace

22
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:20,849
doing the paperwork that was necessary

23
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:24,780
for such a discussion but this cannabis

24
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:26,099
now has reached a new stage and that's

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,890
what we need to talk about and

26
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,728
understand that it is not the cannabis

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,269
industry that was around when I was a

28
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:38,640
teenager and so we'll talk a little bit

29
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:41,129
about that I just you also you know

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,680
about ever sit in Congress for 30 years

31
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,469
I was in gray and white house for seven

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,110
years I was President Reagan's a senior

33
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,390
speechwriter and a special assistant to

34
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,938
the President and then I ran for

35
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,390
Congress for 30 years I've been in the

36
00:01:53,938 --> 00:02:01,188
house and after all of that time in

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,718
public service peoples ask you know well

38
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:06,529
what's it like and what do you feel now

39
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,719
that it's all over and you look back

40
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,840
there's a story in Ronald Reagan always

41
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,209
told me well Dana

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,620
sure that you always start off with a

43
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:22,310
little funny story and there is a story

44
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,650
I didn't that Regan like to tell about a

45
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,409
fellow who and he was younger had a gang

46
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,110
of friends that they and he hung around

47
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:33,829
with all the time and as they got older

48
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,930
most of them didn't succeed as much as

49
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,920
one of them did one of them just made

50
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,780
millions and millions of dollars and

51
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:44,958
when he got to be about 50 or 60 years

52
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,469
old he decided to get the old gang back

53
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,199
and he invited the old gang to his

54
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:53,139
mansion and they were in the backyard

55
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,298
and he said I'm going to show you those

56
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:59,089
something or ugly never seen this is a

57
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:01,700
swimming pool that one and he pushed a

58
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,878
button and all of a sudden the long

59
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:07,959
started the part and there was a

60
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:11,750
swimming pool like underneath the turf

61
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:16,239
beautiful swimming pool except it was

62
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:19,818
filled with crocodiles alligators sharks

63
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,000
piranhas this was you know our story and

64
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:24,828
then what he did all these fish going

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,379
after each other you're going after

66
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,840
whatever we got in the water and the guy

67
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:35,000
who owned the place that does old the

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,759
gang you know I'm willing to give 250

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,979
thousand dollars the any one of you are

70
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,250
every one of you who will swim across

71
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:48,138
this pool is you in order to succeed

72
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,840
you've got to take risks okay so no one

73
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,459
jumped in the pool as I said I didn't

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,969
think anybody would be foolish enough to

75
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,189
do that

76
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:57,979
come on over have a little barbecue as

77
00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:00,769
they walk toward the barbecue he heard a

78
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:02,869
splash he looks around and there's a guy

79
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,500
in the pool he's beating away the

80
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,750
crocodiles as a shark

81
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,879
and he hits on the nose he swims across

82
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,490
the pool and as he's getting that with

83
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,829
that swimming pool the man runs over to

84
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,330
me says that was incredible

85
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,250
how do you want me to give you the money

86
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:23,270
and he says I don't care about the money

87
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:25,529
I want to know who pushed me in that and

88
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,949
now that I'm done with my congressional

89
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:34,229
career I sort of feel huh who pushed me

90
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:36,329
in that pool and however they you know

91
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,030
no one said democracy was going to be

92
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:42,539
easy and no one said that just because

93
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:44,489
you believe in what you believe in that

94
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,860
you're econo sincere about it which I've

95
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,650
tried to be in my career that you are

96
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,360
going to succeed or that you will be

97
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:53,789
remembered for the good things you did

98
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,030
because quite often than the way when

99
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,950
humankind is they remember the bad

100
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,139
things are the mistakes that one makes

101
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,209
rather than the accomplishments while

102
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,310
I'm very proud and better whether

103
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:07,620
they're recognized or not a nerd

104
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,939
probably played a role yes and ended the

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,639
Cold War and but also I'm very proud of

106
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:20,269
them that I played a major role in

107
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,269
ending the war on cannabis especially

108
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:30,930
reading books today I wore a special

109
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:32,279
shirt and remained out of guns last

110
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,829
night you probably some of you may have

111
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:40,918
noticed I wore my yeah this is elephants

112
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:44,899
in the weed that's why they call it

113
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:47,998
that was given into heat by a

114
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:52,019
neighboring town from Ethiopia who is my

115
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:53,969
survey partner in California and there's

116
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:57,089
a few only a few black surfers and

117
00:05:53,968 --> 00:06:00,538
here's one of them end just let you know

118
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:03,658
that is my sport I am a surfer and I've

119
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:05,688
been a surface that many many years and

120
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:09,629
I'm going to give you this analogy

121
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:13,199
surfers in order to catch the wave you

122
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:16,169
don't look to the inside wave you don't

123
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,810
worry less breaking right now but you

124
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:21,899
look to the outside wave and then you

125
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,288
position yourself so where you give you

126
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,810
get the maximum ride on that way and

127
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:30,959
what we have to do now is understand

128
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,329
that there's a wave coming that's on the

129
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,399
outside people think that right now that

130
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:37,918
the cannabis industry oh my goodness

131
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,399
look at what it is today compared to

132
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,930
what it was just a few years ago and it

133
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,709
was only about five or six years ago

134
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,259
that my amendment finally passed in the

135
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,688
Senate that went to it or the house and

136
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,479
then was written law of the thing and by

137
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:57,389
the president only a five or six years

138
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:01,829
ago that was you know that's right now

139
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:03,810
but on the outside there is a wave a

140
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:07,050
cannabis wave about to hit the world

141
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,889
economy and you represent that wave

142
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,139
that's coming because for too long for a

143
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,778
hundred years

144
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:19,139
cannabis was suppressed as a benefit to

145
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:21,838
mankind that for a hundred years

146
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,588
what could have been used in a number of

147
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:29,750
ways to help human beings was denied

148
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:33,360
them by various forces in our societies

149
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,250
so with that that's all changing now we

150
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,158
have to prepare for that those who are

151
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,319
prepared will will make a profit those

152
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:43,438
who are prepared will be able to do the

153
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,930
most good and then will be however a lot

154
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,350
of changes in the

155
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,590
misery s compared as I say to what it

156
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:54,590
was when it was underground and when it

157
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:57,198
was not legal so first of all let me

158
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:59,538
just say my cheap motive and getting

159
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,300
involved with cannabis was the same but

160
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:06,409
if I had in fighting communism earlier

161
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:16,370
in my life and that is this is a freedom

162
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:19,550
issue to me and I wouldn't say that

163
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,699
missus I had time so he gives me I go so

164
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,939
that's the world about freedom and and

165
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:28,419
be afraid um and somebody was mentioning

166
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:31,160
that to me how they were at one of my

167
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:33,288
presentations I never stay free and I

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,788
couldn't help the thing I think it's a

169
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:41,208
little bit nicer than feeling we'd have

170
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:44,088
an open or sophisticated to call for

171
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:48,829
freedom but what we are experiencing now

172
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:51,350
is a revelation to so many people that

173
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:55,400
this suppression that we've had has had

174
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,610
a tremendous cost on society and first

175
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:02,899
of all let us just note we have been

176
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:07,610
financing gangsters and drug dealers who

177
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:10,129
are the worst of the lot for the last 50

178
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,519
200 years we would provision the

179
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:15,320
headsman for alcohol the gangsters were

180
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,600
finally cut off from their source of

181
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,420
revenue and had to go to some other

182
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,930
business well what we have because of

183
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:27,169
the illegalities we have created a

184
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:28,729
gangster system in the world you were

185
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:31,159
the ones who are going to break that

186
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,800
gangster system you were the ones who

187
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:37,610
are going to make sure that what we have

188
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:40,099
is a product that is safe a product that

189
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,810
when you sell it to someone after what

190
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,899
you have done they know what they're

191
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:48,379
getting after and you they will know

192
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:50,059
exactly how much they are taking they

193
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,580
will know whether or not there are

194
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:55,069
dangerous things to be it as part of

195
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,879
that but they're consuming you are going

196
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,310
to be the ones

197
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,059
are providing that and at the same time

198
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:03,919
making sure that was some of the worst

199
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:06,799
anti societal elements in the world

200
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,589
these gangsters are cut off from their

201
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:13,370
source of funding so this is really a

202
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:16,700
tremendous a tremendous time to be alive

203
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,820
and to be in the cannabis industry it's

204
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,070
exciting and I have no doubt that in the

205
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,870
future that we're going to make sure

206
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,260
that people understand and they will

207
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,509
understand just what that means to their

208
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:33,019
lives after they've been told that

209
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:35,450
marijuana and cannabis is some sort of

210
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:38,539
really horrible thing that needs to be

211
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,790
stamped out you know when I thought I

212
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:43,250
was a surfer I really am and I I've had

213
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:45,469
troubles those surfers yeah most people

214
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,929
only see these wonderful beautiful

215
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,590
bodies on their surfboard I will tell

216
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:51,219
you something

217
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,139
surfing is really hard on your body

218
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,930
especially when he had to be 71 years

219
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,240
old as I am right now and it all comes

220
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:02,589
back yeah you're you're paying the price

221
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,320
for those moments ecstasy on that way

222
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:09,230
and what's happened is I get mental

223
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,570
shoulders of my arms now I surf away all

224
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,050
the cartilage in my arms because it was

225
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:19,790
all like this but also I've got

226
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:22,159
arthritis in my neck all right so I've

227
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:25,069
been a cannabis advocate for a long time

228
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:29,509
and I was mentioning this pain that I am

229
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:32,570
now in my neck and some guy says hey you

230
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:34,850
know why don't you fuse this CBD cream

231
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,560
that we've got you know your your

232
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:42,529
advocate why don't you use it and so

233
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:45,229
okay I want you to know that this was

234
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,929
only about two or three weeks ago and I

235
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,330
had this horrible arthritis in my neck

236
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:53,750
and so I finally reached it and put it

237
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,420
in there whoa I do know that I the pain

238
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,830
stopped for three days and then in just

239
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:01,069
a little bit more cream on where the

240
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,379
keepin came back now is it is this

241
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,220
wonderful for me but the bigger question

242
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:09,009
we have to ask ourselves why the hell

243
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,310
we allow so many people to sit there in

244
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:14,679
pain suffering all of this time think

245
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:15,219
about it before there was that cannabis

246
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,229
cream

247
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,139
what alternative did they have well they

248
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,090
just drink more and that's what I've

249
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,580
been especially in old folks homes and

250
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:27,009
senior living centers people we were

251
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,990
they were they be they begin about 10 20

252
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,569
years ago was noted that they're filling

253
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,269
up with drunks because they would be

254
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:37,840
drinking too much to deal with their

255
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:41,049
suffering what making cannabis illegal

256
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,810
has done then one major thing making it

257
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:49,829
illegal made sure that we had people

258
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:52,359
were suffering and they now of course

259
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,520
instead of having to drink there to

260
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,759
alleviate that suffering or or take some

261
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,159
other type of drug they have an

262
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:03,039
alternative that I believe God created

263
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,740
the cannabis plant in order to serve

264
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,319
mankind and to help us eliminate that

265
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,269
suffering and in order to do that and

266
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,600
take advantage of that opportunity of

267
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,340
course you have to have freedom and it's

268
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,060
always again if someone does not want to

269
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:21,759
take advantage of this plant in order to

270
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:24,519
alleviate suffering from themselves or

271
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:27,490
anyone else they should be free not to

272
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,009
use it at the same time people should be

273
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,899
free to make those choices in their life

274
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:35,110
and that's what this has all been about

275
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:38,939
now Republicans all of course did not

276
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:41,649
think that way but let me just note that

277
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,200
when we finally got this passed I've

278
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,959
been trying to hit this legalized

279
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,530
medical marijuana amendment passed for

280
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,560
about 15 20 years now and when it

281
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:56,799
finally passed it was because we came up

282
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:59,069
with the formula and we just heard how

283
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,169
this relates to Switzerland as well

284
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,990
that's with your Canton system is very

285
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:07,990
similar to the state system and the

286
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,700
Republicans in the United States have

287
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,610
always been talking about the Tenth

288
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:18,280
Amendment and states rights so I was

289
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,840
able I was able to get the Republican

290
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,028
vote that I needed

291
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,820
by simply saying we're going to leave it

292
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,559
up to the states realizing that the

293
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,740
people of the states would make the

294
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,379
right decision for them and once that

295
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,930
pass there's as I say that's what you

296
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:37,899
see now beginning to break but if you

297
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:40,209
look right about right past what's going

298
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:44,889
on what's going out there for the in the

299
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:47,639
long run we now have a seismic change in

300
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:52,120
the nature of Western civilization and

301
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:56,169
it's because this plant does so many

302
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:01,060
things this plant will provide look you

303
00:14:56,169 --> 00:15:04,209
see see this okay now that's just the

304
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:07,289
elephant in the weed but how do you know

305
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:11,200
that this isn't made out of weed right

306
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:14,259
my family were all North Dakota farmers

307
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,570
they were very poor farmers say my dad

308
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,450
left this farm in North Dakota a

309
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:22,000
daughter to fight World War two and he

310
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,040
never went back to the farm he stayed in

311
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,259
the Marine Corps and when I was young I

312
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,059
would go and work on the farm with him

313
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,620
when it's on his month off in the Marine

314
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:31,719
Corps

315
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,519
well farming life is really a hard life

316
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,100
and they're always looking for a crop

317
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,329
that they could use and sell it has been

318
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:45,100
illegal in the United States to grow

319
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:47,830
cannabis to grow this plant the has so

320
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,899
much positive to offer and it has been

321
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:55,120
illegal and at the same time however

322
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:57,899
here might my grandfather's farm is

323
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,690
about 20 miles from the Canadian border

324
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:04,360
but we have permitted the Canadians to

325
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:09,700
import a billion and a half dollars

326
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:12,519
worth of of him every year although the

327
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:16,060
farmers on our side of the border were

328
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:19,689
not permitted to do so I mean this is

329
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:21,849
the insanity of the type of regulation

330
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,410
controls we have in order to quote

331
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:29,200
protect us from ourselves and that's

332
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:32,829
what we have today of course is we have

333
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,910
a recognition by so many people at least

334
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,280
by the Republic

335
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:38,350
are finally admitting that government

336
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:41,110
isn't there to make the personal

337
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,139
decisions in your life for you now we've

338
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,180
had this dichotomy the Democrats want to

339
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:48,730
control every inch of people's economic

340
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:51,489
lives they think they can do business

341
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,350
better than the small businessman who

342
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,360
runs his business they think the

343
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,730
government can do better by giving him

344
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,159
the orders of exactly what he can do but

345
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,740
the Republicans think that they can run

346
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,759
your personal life by telling you what

347
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:08,829
to do in your personal life and I think

348
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:12,099
that what's happening now is as a result

349
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:14,889
as is with the states rights issue we

350
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:18,459
were able to break down that that

351
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:21,880
political dichotomy which ll Duss right

352
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:24,700
where we were for so long let me just

353
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,860
give you a couple things about what I

354
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,559
expect in the future and I we are happy

355
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:34,259
to answer a couple questions

356
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:38,559
the a my I hope we have enough time okay

357
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:41,200
let me just say this about where people

358
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:45,669
are coming from and and you know when I

359
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,610
was a kid people got put in jail for

360
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:52,029
smoking marijuana just having a joint

361
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:53,949
would put you in jail but the people who

362
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,990
were going to jail for so long in the

363
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,470
United States weren't just people like

364
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,720
myself because I at least came from a

365
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,819
upper-middle income after my dad got it

366
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,339
got out of the Marine Corps he got a job

367
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:07,869
in the aerospace industry and so we

368
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:10,689
lived in the upper middle-income life

369
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:14,859
well the kids who smoked marijuana back

370
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:19,059
in my day if they got arrested they

371
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:20,919
would go to jail and within a very short

372
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:24,099
period of time their lawyer would emerge

373
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,960
and then what would happen the lawyer

374
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:29,049
would say we've worked a deal out with

375
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,170
the judge and you can just you'll get

376
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:34,750
oil off with a misdemeanor and then that

377
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,240
was forgotten but all the kids from the

378
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,210
black community or from the Chicanos or

379
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,279
little lower-income they'd be put in

380
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,660
jail if they were caught with a baggie

381
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:48,769
of marijuana in their pocket

382
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,269
and they'd be told the well first of all

383
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:53,029
they'd sit in jail for two or three days

384
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:56,210
before the public defender arrived and

385
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,920
said you need to plead guilty you need

386
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,079
to plead guilty and then they'll be

387
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,050
lenient on you and by pleading guilty

388
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,629
they ended up with this with a whole

389
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:08,000
generation of young people from the

390
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:11,210
poorer communities who ended up with

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,450
criminal records and after that what

392
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:17,029
kind of jobs could they get we what case

393
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,990
oh the overall impact on our society was

394
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:23,930
horrendous but nobody could see that

395
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:26,809
nobody saw that the black and Chicano

396
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:30,230
communities understood it but nobody

397
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:34,059
else could see it so that hopefully now

398
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:38,779
we are going to eliminate that type of

399
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:40,609
horrendous result in what was meant in

400
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:42,799
let's face it I believe the people who

401
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:45,349
came in and made it cannabis illegal in

402
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,909
the first place we're doing so because

403
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:51,409
they thought they were trying to help us

404
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:55,820
and know they were ended up creating

405
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:59,150
gangsterism condemning poor people to a

406
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:02,179
lifetime of unable to get jobs and they

407
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:04,370
were actually destroying our freedom and

408
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,769
that's what it was all about so with

409
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:09,679
that said I am proud to help play a role

410
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:13,240
in coming up with the political formula

411
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:16,340
that broke the logjam and created a new

412
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,470
America and a new world that is just

413
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:20,449
right out there for me it's the wave on

414
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,789
the outside we haven't even seen the

415
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,080
impact that this is going to create yet

416
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:30,680
we're gonna have paper we're gonna have

417
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:33,379
safe drugs the opiates that now cause so

418
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,240
much agony and one of our people we have

419
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,610
a way to replace them now we have

420
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,930
actually from what I understand that

421
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:43,699
cannabis is a way a method we use call

422
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,460
it the gateway drug this way they have

423
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,380
to eliminate it now we understand it's a

424
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,769
gateway all right it's a gateway out of

425
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:54,950
drug addiction in that it can be used to

426
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,069
actually get people off of an addiction

427
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,069
to other drugs

428
00:20:56,069 --> 00:21:01,648
so what a tremendous exciting adventure

429
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:03,418
we're about to have and I'm proud to

430
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:06,268
stand with you and the other people in

431
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:09,179
this world and in my country that really

432
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:10,679
truly believe in freedom so with that

433
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,259
said if you have any questions I think

434
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,399
I've got a couple minutes left yeah give

435
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,720
it up for Dana Rohrabacher

436
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:21,569
Thank You Dana thank you question

437
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,089
question who's got a question anybody

438
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:26,210
got a question okay here I come I'm on

439
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:26,209
my way

440
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:37,528
Thank You congressman when do you see

441
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,749
federal legalization in the u.s. you

442
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:42,358
know we'd step-by-step you know we've

443
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:45,450
already legalized it to the degree that

444
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:47,638
for medical purposes in the States

445
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,979
that was the first step and that we and

446
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:52,738
also now we have the hemp bill which is

447
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:56,879
an actual first step towards an actual

448
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:59,759
federal legalization I think that and

449
00:21:56,878 --> 00:22:01,858
this is gonna sound optimistic but I

450
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,589
don't think it is optimistic I think the

451
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:09,989
way the politics is shaping up in the

452
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:12,509
United States today that in this some

453
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:13,979
place early next year because our

454
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:16,489
Congress is you know we have two years

455
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:20,009
so the second year of this Congress

456
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:23,129
before the elections start taking place

457
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:25,019
you will find a consensus right now

458
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:27,509
there's all kinds of ideas out there

459
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,940
people are putting there they're putting

460
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:32,038
it bills in the hopper that go for this

461
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,909
and different elements of the challenge

462
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:39,179
we face and I think that what you'll

463
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:42,109
have is probably have about January or

464
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,849
February you'll see that they'll start

465
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:47,398
organizing it so all of these ideas will

466
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:50,939
start being put into one bill and there

467
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:53,459
will be a cannabis bill and that's when

468
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,489
you will have a negotiation by something

469
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,220
a lot of people have missed of the

470
00:22:56,489 --> 00:23:02,038
significance of I'm gone okay I'm no

471
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,639
longer there to to play the referee and

472
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:07,798
to try to get some movement forward but

473
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:09,219
I may be gone but there's another

474
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,369
Republican there

475
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:17,169
who is in as incredible influence on

476
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:20,229
this his name is Donald Trump and Donald

477
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:23,020
Trump I've had a number of a couple

478
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:26,860
conversations with him and during the

479
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:31,599
last election he made his position very

480
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:36,158
clear and that he believed that medical

481
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:38,139
use of cannabis should be they should be

482
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,870
legal this round they cannot the whole

483
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,480
country and that personal recreational

484
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:46,558
adult use should be left up to the

485
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,870
states and he repeated that in public

486
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:52,569
three times during that election now a

487
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:55,178
lot of people mistakenly think that

488
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:59,649
because Trump has such a wonderful

489
00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:01,390
personality and yes and it gets in the

490
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,700
way so wonderful he gets it away

491
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,970
no but President Trump has an abrasive

492
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,740
personality and they mistakenly because

493
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,529
they don't like that now remember I

494
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,480
worked for Reagan and Reagan everything

495
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:16,089
was had to be proper it was a sense of

496
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,950
propriety and by the way I'll do one

497
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:20,918
thing about that I know I could describe

498
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,100
this first you got to understand why

499
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:28,030
that is Reagan came from a very poor

500
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:29,769
family Ronald Reagan literally what they

501
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:35,079
were the poorest of the poor in the

502
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:38,679
United States and Reagan in order to

503
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:42,308
have a self-esteem he had to make sure

504
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:44,679
he acted in a proper way and he dressed

505
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:47,678
in a proper way and he talked in a

506
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:50,070
proper way and he told funny stories and

507
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,659
and it was likable in a proper way

508
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:53,288
Don Trump didn't have to do any of those

509
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,570
things

510
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:59,859
he was he came from a very wealthy

511
00:24:55,569 --> 00:25:02,259
family so he has a natural tendency to

512
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:04,209
say well I'll try not to use a swear

513
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:08,259
word here well screw that or whatever

514
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:11,860
and and so people look at that as being

515
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:13,658
you know abrasive and it is but don't

516
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:15,428
pay to end and everybody who hates Don

517
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:17,440
Trump is usually you say why do you hate

518
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:18,630
Don Trump it's always always because of

519
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,700
his personality

520
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,060
well there's policies that he is talking

521
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,600
about I happen to agree with

522
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:29,210
policies most of them but the policies I

523
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:31,189
like the most is the fact that he is

524
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,490
going to be the leader and the lead sled

525
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,890
dog in the con the cannabis issue mark

526
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:41,029
my words you will have this coalition

527
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:43,550
form it surprised everybody and you know

528
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:45,829
I tried to be the lead sled dog on this

529
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:48,859
issue and you know what they say it was

530
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:52,789
a Norman times the lead stealth sled dog

531
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:54,349
has the best view but the lead sled dog

532
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:57,139
is the one who gets bitten on the ass

533
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:59,019
and just because your ass is bleeding

534
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:03,830
doesn't mean you're the lead sled dog

535
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:05,779
but I'm no longer the lead sled dog but

536
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,609
Trump is going to be and there's going

537
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:09,410
so work that's what's going to happen

538
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:11,719
and I think that there will be a new

539
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,110
bill and it will pass and it will go

540
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,470
about half the way to what we need but

541
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:20,929
it will be a giant step forward and

542
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,539
that's where I think we're at all right

543
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:31,310
do we have one more question right there

544
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:33,980
here we go so I was just wondering you

545
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:37,940
mentioned that cannabis is the gateway

546
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:42,049
out of other types of addiction or

547
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:44,150
dependence um I also see it as a gateway

548
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:48,589
to the end of the war on drugs in

549
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:50,480
general and I'm wondering what your

550
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:52,730
views on that are especially with

551
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,880
regards to perhaps the dissolution of

552
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,400
the Controlled Substances Act and also

553
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,070
on an international level or on the

554
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,230
international level with the 61 71 and

555
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:08,619
88 controlled substance conventions if

556
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:13,930
you see the u.s. changing its stance

557
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:13,929
internationally as well in the future no

558
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:20,390
I I agree with everything you said I

559
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:23,240
look I am someone with a libertarian

560
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,530
background and I just want the guy but

561
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,099
the government should but out of our

562
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:28,220
lives

563
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:30,379
yeah leave us alone leave the lead hey

564
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,289
those individuals and his business

565
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,690
people leads us leave us alone however

566
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:36,028
that's not the way most people feel even

567
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,580
in

568
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:40,950
states where we're so proud of of

569
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:42,898
liberty as being you know look our

570
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,759
founding fathers first of all we came

571
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:47,579
from every religion and race in the

572
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:50,069
world they came there in order to create

573
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:52,528
this new country based on the principles

574
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:55,528
of what they said it right out this is

575
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:57,929
the principles of life liberty and the

576
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:59,219
pursuit not of by the way not that he

577
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,559
didn't say they were suitor property

578
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:05,278
which is what was popular in those days

579
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:07,678
the pursuit of happiness this is

580
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,288
wonderful and I do believe that that

581
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,778
that still is the guideposts to to

582
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,548
Americans who think about it

583
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:16,528
but most Americans aren't thinking about

584
00:28:14,548 --> 00:28:19,979
it and they just are sort of going along

585
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:23,338
with with a basic concepts of what's not

586
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:25,558
going to disrupt society etc so I don't

587
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:28,168
think we're gonna have that that

588
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,329
traumatic that the type of liberalism

589
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,700
say liberation I wouldn't say

590
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:35,939
liberalization the liberation that we

591
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:39,330
would have however let us just note also

592
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,479
that we have had a horrendous situation

593
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:47,069
here the the opiates now when we're

594
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:51,450
talking about the opiates it is a horror

595
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:55,019
story that our government approved the

596
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:57,389
sale of this and doctors kept

597
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:01,259
prescribing this knowing that these

598
00:28:57,388 --> 00:29:03,258
opiates were addictive and harmful yet

599
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:06,118
they went instead of instead of

600
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:07,710
legalizing cannabis they were willing to

601
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:09,868
do that with people's lives

602
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:15,210
I'd only given one last story and that

603
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:17,418
is how I realized that what that I was

604
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,739
going to be able to succeed politically

605
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,778
I've been the front man on this for a

606
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:25,019
long long time because I believe in it

607
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:26,519
and I I believe I tried to do and I was

608
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,118
in Congress the things I believed were

609
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,009
true and right but that didn't mean that

610
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:35,128
at any moment I could be unelected

611
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:37,259
because again the public attitude has to

612
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:39,838
be taken into consideration but how much

613
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:42,509
leverage that you've got so I didn't

614
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:44,308
know whether or not I was going to end

615
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:47,729
up with booted out of the Congress

616
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:49,279
probably five six years ago because I

617
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:52,279
was about to succeed

618
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,269
in a major step forward in liberalizing

619
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,769
cannabis restrictions so I decided I had

620
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:01,279
an appointment in my office with a

621
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:04,609
person with a guy who is my a resident

622
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,609
of my district and I said to myself this

623
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:10,819
guy is the quintessential Rohrbacher

624
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:14,389
voter now I'm gonna ask him and find out

625
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:18,099
what he thinks about the fact that his

626
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:20,929
congressman is leading the fight to

627
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:24,168
legalize cannabis and and legalize

628
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:26,750
medical marijuana and so he came in and

629
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,780
he sat down and we were talking and I

630
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,390
said gee I want to know you know

631
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:34,099
actually I'm gonna be succeeding in this

632
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,940
effort that I've been working on for a

633
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,298
long time

634
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,509
about medical marijuana because we're

635
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:44,269
gonna leave it up to the states and and

636
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:46,849
I've you know I've got the vote figured

637
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:48,349
out and I'm gonna win this vote and what

638
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:50,808
do you think about the fact that your

639
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:54,139
congressman is leading the fight to

640
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:56,808
legalize medical marijuana and he said

641
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,679
well Dana you really don't know me do

642
00:30:56,808 --> 00:31:03,079
you I said well I know that you were in

643
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:07,370
the Navy and that you were a pilot in

644
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:09,048
the Navy and that you are an officer and

645
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:12,889
that you now work for a major aerospace

646
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:16,308
firm I know that and I know you're

647
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:18,140
Republican they says yeah but you don't

648
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:22,009
really know me you don't know that I

649
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:27,020
have three sons and you don't know that

650
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:30,379
the day after 9/11 by three sons joined

651
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:33,700
up they all marched off and signed up

652
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:37,490
and then what you also don't know is

653
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:40,460
that a few years later two of my sons

654
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:44,569
came home but one of them that came home

655
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:47,929
the third son was no longer my son he

656
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:50,960
was having convulsions every day on the

657
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:55,548
floor and I could do nothing to save my

658
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,808
son he says and now I don't know how

659
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:59,929
many of you have children and I have a

660
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:02,480
son that would break my heart if that

661
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:04,429
was happening to me and so

662
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,710
he said I couldn't do anything I

663
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:08,570
struggled and I we were taking him to

664
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:13,190
the VA hospital and they were doing

665
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:15,230
nothing for him and finally he said a

666
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:18,558
doctor pulled me aside said see me in my

667
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:21,079
office out in the town on the city and

668
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:24,200
we did and he said look your son needs

669
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:27,109
marijuana this is how to get it and this

670
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,740
is how to use it do it and he said you

671
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:33,949
know my son hasn't had a convulsion

672
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:37,970
since that day he says how do I feel

673
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:39,529
about you how do I feel about you he

674
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:42,769
said I'm gonna come over and I'm gonna

675
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:45,769
give you a big hug now this story would

676
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:49,819
be over right here at this point but it

677
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:51,619
even gets better okay because that of

678
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:53,899
course it touched my heart and I've

679
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:56,029
repeated that story and that man has

680
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,500
become someone who I've kept in touch

681
00:32:56,029 --> 00:33:05,418
with and I got this call about six

682
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:08,329
months ago and he said well we got

683
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:10,580
something else to thank you about and I

684
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:13,009
said well what is it he says well my son

685
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:14,449
the one that was having the trouble and

686
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:18,470
still you know his face is a real

687
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:20,960
struggle he went to the VA hospital and

688
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:24,289
he was there he felt something coming on

689
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,460
so he went down to his car I guess to

690
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:31,308
smoke a joint or something and he goes

691
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:35,090
and he says and the damn parking lot

692
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:36,798
attendant arrested him and I don't know

693
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,019
what and he says yeah it's he arrested

694
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,279
and today he was brought to court and

695
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,168
that's why I'm calling you

696
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:44,119
I said well why are you calling me he

697
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:46,970
says well because when it went into the

698
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:49,609
court the judge looked at everybody

699
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:52,490
around he says look at this case and

700
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:57,889
this case is young man was possession

701
00:33:52,490 --> 00:34:00,650
and utilizing marijuana and it says here

702
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:04,610
that okay and I see that the case is

703
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:06,710
being brought up by the the DEA and the

704
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,699
Department of Justice DEA and that's

705
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,220
where the

706
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,230
the people doing the prosecution or part

707
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:14,328
of the federal government but I can't

708
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,378
help but read this position in this law

709
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:19,970
that was passed that says that no one in

710
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:22,219
the Department of Justice will use any

711
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:24,739
of these funds in order to supersede a

712
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:27,618
state law that legalizes medical

713
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:29,689
marijuana he says I believe this is what

714
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:31,789
we're calling medical marijuana and I

715
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:35,148
believe you are federal agents so this

716
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:37,969
case is thrown out bang and so the guy

717
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:39,888
immediately went to the telephone and

718
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:41,628
called me to thank me

719
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:44,628
very literally helping his son for a

720
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:46,309
second time so look right now there are

721
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:48,710
all kinds of people like that young man

722
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:50,320
there's all kinds of people who were

723
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,699
getting arrested because they had

724
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,530
cannabis in their pocket and their

725
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:59,088
family didn't have a way to defend them

726
00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:02,150
against unhealthier or over prosecution

727
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:05,420
so right now we've made some giant steps

728
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,920
forward this all of you are part of the

729
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,039
wave that's forming that's going to

730
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,800
reform this whole area of humankind and

731
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:15,529
we will be proud that we fought for

732
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,210
freedom and we eliminated suffering and

733
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,280
we brought more fairness to the world

734
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,510
