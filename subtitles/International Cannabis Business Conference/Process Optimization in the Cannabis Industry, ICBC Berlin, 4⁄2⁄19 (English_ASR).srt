1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
so my name is Josh Holloway I'm from

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,878
serious greenhouse solutions were based

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,879
in Boulder Colorado I've been working in

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:12,509
the cannabis industry since 2009 I'm a

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,450
dispensary owner indoor grower and we've

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,618
then developed this greenhouse that

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,969
we've been selling for the past eight

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:23,070
years and developing I work with a

9
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,439
partner who is German he lives in

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,768
Colorado as well and our goal has always

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,300
been high efficiency in growing using

12
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,070
sunlight as much as possible because

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,480
it's what the plant wants and it's the

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,789
most efficient way to grow as far as

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,738
operational costs so I'm gonna speak for

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,570
a quick second about the building's what

17
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,479
we do what we think is the most optimal

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,039
way to grow cannabis and then Jim will

19
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,500
step in and talk about how his group

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,640
controls the interior environment of

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,929
indoor grows as well as the greenhouse

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,170
what's quite relevant with our

23
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:02,609
greenhouse and his system well back so

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,409
real quick we have a hybrid greenhouse

25
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,359
design that I'll talk about climate

26
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,770
control just very simply well let Jim do

27
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,150
that and then a few featured project so

28
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,319
you get a feel for what it is that we're

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,868
doing across the u.s. Canada and now

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,849
dive into Europe Australia and South

31
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:21,509
America as well

32
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:24,658
our goal is high yields highest quality

33
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,969
and lowest operating cost possible we

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,100
see it here we don't deal with GMP in

35
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,810
the US yet but we will but we're quite

36
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:36,000
aware of it and we design our buildings

37
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,950
to be able to be GMP certified but the

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,560
goal in the end is the highest quality

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,079
cameras that we that we can grow in the

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,909
United States are in Colorado

41
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,519
specifically cannabis is being grown for

42
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,859
about a thousand dollars a pound is the

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,599
wholesale cost and we find that our

44
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,489
growers are getting up to fifteen

45
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,618
hundred dollars a pound just because of

46
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,390
the quality of the product so there's a

47
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,459
real differentiation to be had and it

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,069
shows itself financially if you are

49
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,399
growing a really high quality product we

50
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:08,669
find the Sun allows that to happen

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,068
controlling the greenhouse itself is a

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,229
really more difficult process but

53
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,329
necessary to to create

54
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,738
high quality cannabis this is just a

55
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,019
quick slide to show a traditional

56
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,789
European green house versus something

57
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:22,769
that we're doing it's a highly insulated

58
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,628
structure it appears that there's less

59
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,989
glazing but often times there's more

60
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,969
light we allow as much par light as

61
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:33,360
possible and also full UV through our

62
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:36,959
glazings unlike an indoor grow the

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,580
greenhouses that have full UV have

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,348
really high quality cannabis more

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,799
cannabinoids more terpenes more

66
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:45,539
flavonoids the plant wants UV and you

67
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:50,250
can see it in the quality of the product

68
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:52,259
that comes off the plant our design is

69
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,719
we call it an offset gable we face

70
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,568
themselves but the goal here is that we

71
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,919
actually are insulating so we can grow

72
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:01,589
in cold weather climates whether it's

73
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,929
northern Northern Europe or we are high

74
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,680
in the mountains in Colorado we can

75
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,799
still maintain very steady temperatures

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,299
but it also allows us to have very

77
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,390
controlled so if it's warm and it gets

78
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,489
cold we don't see fluctuations in the

79
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,138
greenhouse the greenhouse functions very

80
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,959
much like an indoor burrow room very

81
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,459
small swings in temperature and humidity

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,889
but still allowing that natural sunlight

83
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,450
we also have supplemental lighting at

84
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,280
all times we say it

85
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,738
worst case scenario where an indoor grow

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,019
so you have a standardization best-case

87
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,430
scenario your full Sun four to five

88
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,109
times more light than an indoor grow

89
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,430
would have with zero lighting costs

90
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:43,409
part of our design with our south-facing

91
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,239
greenhouse and our solid facing north

92
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:48,530
walls is that we can harvest light so in

93
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,639
the winter we are low on light levels

94
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,159
here in Germany you'd have less light

95
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,599
obviously than you would in the summer

96
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,848
what our greenhouses can do is if that

97
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,378
light misses the plant if it goes over

98
00:03:56,848 --> 00:04:00,030
the plant it will hit the north wall of

99
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,370
a greenhouse and actually bounce back to

100
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,519
the plant so we see growth heading

101
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,769
towards the north which is not normal

102
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,959
but we've designed it to harvest light

103
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,939
to optimize lighting levels as much as

104
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,340
possible to reduce operational costs and

105
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:20,098
keep the plants happy this is an example

106
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,129
of a custom green greenhouse that we've

107
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:25,740
built in Boulder Colorado this is 22,000

108
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,920
square feet or 2,200 square meters it's

109
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,240
broken into

110
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,560
five greenhouses 420 square meters each

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,180
with an insulated head house that has

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,439
processing offices indoor veg these

113
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,180
things are flexible but this gives you

114
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:43,329
an idea of what we're looking at to the

115
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,490
left is the south and so we orient the

116
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:47,379
greenhouses towards the Sun the right

117
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,180
side of those structures is north we

118
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:53,230
insulate them they can hold heat and

119
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,199
harvest light screenhouse has 90% light

120
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,050
transmission full UV and when the Sun is

121
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,349
out there's 20 we measure lighting in

122
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,569
ppfd for the most part and there's 2200

123
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,280
ppfd whereas the best grow room might

124
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,009
say it has a thousand but maybe it

125
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:12,449
really has 600 or 700 so we really have

126
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:14,589
high light levels in these greenhouses

127
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,990
we're constantly evolving with the

128
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:18,579
glazings that we're using this is the

129
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,100
most important thing it allows the light

130
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,949
into the greenhouse we work with a

131
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,590
Japanese company Asahi glassed and have

132
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,680
an ETF II offering which is up to 96%

133
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,359
light transmission with full UV in

134
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,550
colder climates we can do a double layer

135
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,460
of that that gives us some insulation as

136
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,170
well as up to 90% light transmission we

137
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:41,649
work with a German company called Evonik

138
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,240
for an acrylic glazing it has a higher

139
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:45,969
insulation value than traditional

140
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,100
glazings 90% light transmission for UV

141
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,050
and then for a lot of the hemp growers

142
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,320
will use a polycarbonate which is a

143
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,629
plastic and plastic cannot allow UV

144
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,149
through because it would degrade but UV

145
00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:00,129
actually promotes THC production so for

146
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,750
a lot of growers in hemp who don't have

147
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,790
the most stable genetics just yet

148
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,879
potentially Polycarp it's a nice option

149
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,840
because it doesn't allow the UV through

150
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,459
the buildings are actually quite

151
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,569
flexible based on what you're growing

152
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:15,609
and how you're growing this is one of

153
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,040
the most important parts when we get to

154
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,000
cleanliness control is that we keep the

155
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,970
structures as smaller spaces so these

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,060
might be 3,000 of 5,000 square feet 300

157
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,130
to 500 square metres and we'll break

158
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,930
them up into multiple units you can add

159
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,480
as many as you want but this allows us

160
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,879
to control biosecurity if you get a bug

161
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,170
or a mold or mildew or something we can

162
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,949
keep it in one house and it will not

163
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,689
spread unless

164
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,899
you spread it actually physically

165
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,670
yourself we can also maintain different

166
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,459
climates in each house and that'll be

167
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,350
something that Gemma can talk about but

168
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:53,259
depending on strain we can have a warmer

169
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,850
drier room or a cooler more humid room

170
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,099
or depending on stage of growth in the

171
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,260
flowering process we can actually allow

172
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,000
a younger flowering plant to have a

173
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,579
warmer environment with more humidity

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,779
and as flowering progresses towards the

175
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,969
end we can actually dry the room out

176
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:08,529
slightly but it gives us an operational

177
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,840
cost advantage because we don't have two

178
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:16,059
cooler or dehumidifier as much depending

179
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:19,539
on stage of growth we also do design

180
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,639
vented greenhouses many of our hemp

181
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,819
propagators will vent a greenhouse it's

182
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,310
significantly cheaper to use outside air

183
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,139
for GMP certification it's actually much

184
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,100
more difficult to impossible but in the

185
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,589
States

186
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,330
that's not necessary if it's all veg

187
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:36,069
growth and there's no flower and we're

188
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:38,050
only working on propagation a vented

189
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:42,069
greenhouse sometimes can be a good

190
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,810
option for cost savings more and more

191
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,909
though we are moving towards sealed

192
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,280
greenhouses completely closed

193
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,320
environment minimal venting just for

194
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,889
human occupancy which could be maybe 500

195
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,560
CFM one fan necessary just for humans to

196
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,639
be working in the space but for the most

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,030
part these are completely sealed

198
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,709
environments high co2 high light and

199
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:06,599
very controlled and we do a lot of our

200
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:08,829
control based on vapor pressure deficit

201
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,800
again we can maintain stable temps and

202
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:14,529
humidity co2 retention odor control is a

203
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,350
big thing if we're building in urban

204
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:19,659
areas or industrial zones odor can be a

205
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,750
major issue with growers may be the most

206
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,340
difficult issue to deal with when we

207
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:30,129
seal the greenhouses we have way less

208
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:31,539
odor problems GMP certified high

209
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,909
biosecurity because we're not bringing

210
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,190
in outside outside air what we've seen

211
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:39,399
in in the US with the hemp market now

212
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,729
taking off is that vented cannabis grows

213
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:46,539
are taking male pollen from outside hemp

214
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,920
grows and seeding which isn't a total

215
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,139
disaster if you're processing but you

216
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,039
have less lower quality product and

217
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:52,120
you're making less money

218
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,399
this gives you

219
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,889
control complete control over what's

220
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,838
happening inside your greenhouse and

221
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,699
then again vapor pressure deficit is how

222
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,320
we control the greenhouses I don't know

223
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,210
if that many people know about it but it

224
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,270
gives us a range of temperatures along

225
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,370
with a ratio along with a humidity

226
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,110
temperatures can fluctuate as long as we

227
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,278
take humidities with it and the plants

228
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,990
don't feel the difference they can

229
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:19,269
optimally pull water and nutrients

230
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:22,060
through and transpire climate control

231
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,699
which controls our light depth systems

232
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:28,569
our fertigation systems are heating

233
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,900
cooling and dehumidification systems are

234
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,180
getting very smart so we work with we've

235
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,799
developed sequence of operations in our

236
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,359
greenhouses it's flexible these are

237
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,278
software based controllers they're

238
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,690
viewable on your phone you can check

239
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,360
them you can even control things on your

240
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,490
phone but most importantly we track all

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,600
data in the greenhouses everything

242
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,000
that's happening every piece of

243
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,920
equipment that's on when it's on how

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,899
long it's on we can see what's happening

245
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,899
and then we can go back and look at that

246
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,399
data analyze it make adjustments moving

247
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,559
forward we can find what we've had a

248
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,600
really good harvest and completely mimic

249
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,299
that with the same strain with the same

250
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,089
eight-week run of climate controls and

251
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:09,490
it allows us to really dial in what's

252
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,740
happening in the houses this isn't

253
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,659
really a guessing game anymore we know

254
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,230
what's happening and we can mimic it or

255
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:19,230
we can adjust it to make it better and

256
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,330
these are just a few examples this is a

257
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,730
4,000 square meter or 40,000 square feet

258
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,879
hemp greeting facility that we just

259
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,459
built in Oregon each house has different

260
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,820
hemp pollen being thrown he's producing

261
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:37,299
seed for farmers the too far to the

262
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,370
south houses our climate mimickers if

263
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,889
they have light depth and full climate

264
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,110
control so he has he's in Oregon but he

265
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,720
has a client from Florida he can grow

266
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,080
his hemp in a Florida climate based on

267
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,190
Florida daily lighting the integral

268
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,528
humidity levels and everything else a

269
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,180
farmer from Florida can come here step

270
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,740
into that greenhouse and he says here's

271
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,500
your Florida crop this is this seed

272
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,480
grown in Florida conditions so he can

273
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,039
mimic any environment in the world in

274
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,269
the greenhouses and show his clients

275
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,610
what's happening when the other hate 8

276
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:10,350
houses he's breeding

277
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:12,060
see this is a another hemp propagation

278
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,310
greenhouse this is a vented greenhouse

279
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:18,479
it's the same style but slightly

280
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:23,268
different this is at about 7,000 feet of

281
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:28,190
elevation 22 2,300 meters of elevation

282
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:31,169
year-round growing cloning seed breeding

283
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:36,089
but very controlled and highly

284
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:38,240
successful and this is an inside shot of

285
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:42,300
one of our newest cannabis greenhouses

286
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,950
but as a little series plug of what we

287
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,208
do we produce in the US we have

288
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:50,220
manufacturing in Europe as well and we

289
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:53,458
believe we have the most controlled

290
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,560
greenhouse available on the market

291
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:58,129
our clients are proving that out every

292
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,569
day with incredibly high quality product

293
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,429
the lab results that we get back from

294
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,730
the flower that is being produced in

295
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:07,229
these greenhouses is like nothing the

296
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,000
lab guys have ever seen after eight

297
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,350
years we get this often we have never

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,990
seen cannabis like this before and the

299
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,120
biggest thing is what we do is we we

300
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,860
design a structure but then we we are

301
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,679
along with the growers for their

302
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,259
hopefully entire lifetime of growing

303
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,019
we're always learning always tweaking

304
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:31,278
and pushing and this won't be sitting

305
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,360
yeah well babysitting but also but also

306
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,320
they learn stuff that we don't know

307
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,589
because we're not operating in the

308
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,290
houses so they tell us things and so now

309
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:42,120
I pass it to Jim Jim is more on the

310
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:43,559
climate side and he can talk about how

311
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,610
they're controlling the climate in

312
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,539
houses like ours and others thanks

313
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:54,200
it's thank you guys

314
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:57,419
[Applause]

315
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,020
hi I'm gem I'm from an erotic knowledge

316
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,860
ease

317
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,490
we provide environmental solutions to

318
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,950
greenhouses and indoor facilities it's

319
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,720
super important what they are doing

320
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:15,629
because the technologies we provide we

321
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,379
depend on the structures as well for

322
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:22,049
them to actually be in great use so

323
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:24,958
having good isolation and having good

324
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:27,419
design and structure is super important

325
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,419
for the technologies to work at their

326
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:34,259
best capabilities inside so you need to

327
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:36,208
adapt the whole hall from the structure

328
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,909
the construction to the endgame

329
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:43,129
everything needs to be intact with each

330
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:46,769
other I think and we also focus a lot on

331
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:50,009
efficiency in energy saving in in light

332
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:53,220
and also in water water and we make sure

333
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:57,088
that there is a lot of redundancy in the

334
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:01,079
greenhouses or in the comb indoor

335
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:04,010
facilities we also focus on increasing

336
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:09,088
the yield and the quality of the product

337
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:13,139
the technologies we provide Able's you

338
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:16,740
to grow a whole year and our background

339
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,899
is actually agriculture and we've been

340
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,259
in cannabis this last couple years we

341
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,230
have manufacturing in Europe and our

342
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:30,600
offices is in Switzerland and in

343
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:33,450
California and we also filter the air we

344
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,379
cool the air so everything about the

345
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:40,500
climate inside we try to tackle it and

346
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:43,820
our technology Able's you to control

347
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,470
absolute humidity and control

348
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,240
temperature without changing the

349
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,019
temperature we can control the humidity

350
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:56,159
and humidity has a major role in the in

351
00:14:52,019 --> 00:15:01,909
the plants so over time it can be very

352
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:03,809
rewarding or very painful to to have

353
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:09,120
bacteria

354
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:12,869
and fungi and other modules so what we

355
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,230
do we we we take the humidity out and

356
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,360
discharge it and we also clean the air

357
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:22,350
while we're doing this with our liquid

358
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,129
desiccant system and VPD is super

359
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,159
important

360
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:29,338
simply put it's the pressure on the leaf

361
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,829
and the the more pressure there is that

362
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,560
the less transpiration will happen and

363
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,110
the less transpiration which is let's

364
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,099
say sweating the plants the absorption

365
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:46,169
is also related to all of these so the

366
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:50,850
absorption will be less and why designs

367
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:55,379
get good quality corpse crops is because

368
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,899
of the absorption rates they get so

369
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:01,169
controlling the humidity is it's super

370
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:05,549
important for for the plants inside and

371
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:10,079
biohazardous this is a I'll talk about

372
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:13,319
the patented technology we have we do

373
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,540
mostly a closed-loop systems sealed

374
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,980
completely it's very important to have

375
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:23,269
an exhaust and also control cooling and

376
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:27,409
heating and humidity at the same time

377
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:31,039
these are some designs we have done in

378
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:35,100
in Europe and in the States

379
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:38,730
you can see we we do multi rooms multi

380
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:42,269
zone control so some of the rooms can

381
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,839
have different point views and even in

382
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:47,519
the same room you can have different

383
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,980
machines acting differently so the end

384
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:55,199
of the room can have a different cooling

385
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,879
and humidity level then then the the

386
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,620
beginning of the room so these are all

387
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:07,970
up to clients custom how they want to

388
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,970
grow you can see more designs and

389
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:14,819
like I said we manage air quality we

390
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,650
designed a silencer now because most of

391
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:20,970
the regulations are getting stricter and

392
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:23,070
sticker so people around like in Florida

393
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,940
and in Zurich they complain a lot about

394
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:31,069
smell order and they complain about

395
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:34,610
noise so we we try to tackle this with

396
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:39,750
Auto trapping in our machines which is

397
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:41,669
quite hard to do actually because order

398
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,490
is a molecule as well and we control

399
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,730
water molecules in air but we've been

400
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,819
showing great progress on other trapping

401
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,670
as well and while we are doing this we

402
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:56,099
also filtered air sterilize it so you

403
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:01,170
don't need extra filters or or anything

404
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:04,349
in the greenhouse I'll keep on going

405
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:08,220
this is one of the grow rooms we built

406
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:10,199
so here you can see many air to handlers

407
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,690
so all those air handlers can get

408
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,220
different comments and you were talking

409
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,380
about data collection it's super

410
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,610
important all our technology also

411
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,650
collects data so you can learn what our

412
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:25,139
how your air circulation was how much

413
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,710
humidity levels you were at and how much

414
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,590
energy you were spending and you gather

415
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:35,130
all this and then you can have a better

416
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:37,589
analysis of your climate these are some

417
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:41,010
of the machines we our machines go

418
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:44,579
outside so we don't take space inside

419
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:47,839
and we we are a little more industrial

420
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:51,149
size so we we handle really big places

421
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:54,929
you can see the silencers on so these

422
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:58,470
these guys order trap dehumidifier cool

423
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:02,070
heat so it's like a one-stop HVAC

424
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,610
solution we seen that all the

425
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:06,839
technologies inside the greenhouse or

426
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:08,279
facility indoor facility needs to

427
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,669
interact with each other

428
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,920
which becomes a little messy sometimes

429
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,960
to use many different technologies from

430
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,350
many different companies and try to

431
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,420
adapt them all together can cause more

432
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:24,689
risk and problems so we do

433
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:29,580
loved machine which can provide all of

434
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:33,390
this with justing one single brand we

435
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:36,210
also control the the machine and our

436
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,870
systems come with climate control inside

437
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,870
we also can track this through an

438
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:46,139
application and anywhere from the web

439
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:50,609
login and you can also control any other

440
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:53,720
electrical devices inside through our

441
00:19:50,609 --> 00:20:00,990
software which is provided comes with

442
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:03,360
technology and we also control co2 if it

443
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:08,460
needs to be controlled by tanks or by

444
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:11,459
burners we can add coolers and extra

445
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,500
heaters and we can also go modular so

446
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,660
you can if your facility is small first

447
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,869
and you have a modular design in

448
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:22,560
structure you can grow the equipment

449
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:25,589
while growing the structures which is an

450
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:36,990
advantage for for people who doesn't

451
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:38,519
want to start really big thanks I was I

452
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,170
was just gonna point out that we we've

453
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,420
worked with growers in the past to

454
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,300
Colorado is a dry place where we live

455
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,490
it's permanently dry two years ago we

456
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:50,789
had a really wet May it rained almost

457
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,740
the whole month most growers were not

458
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:55,920
set up for that at all they were using

459
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,049
vented greenhouses and almost all of

460
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,870
them lost crops if they were in late

461
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:04,889
flowering in May all lost to powdery

462
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:06,869
mildew and so what a what a controlled

463
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,509
environment does off the bat with your

464
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:10,949
initial design it's really more than

465
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,809
anything an ideal growing environment

466
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,059
but more so it's insurance that

467
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,309
regardless of what's happening outside

468
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,230
in the environment you are going to have

469
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:22,079
the ability to control the interior

470
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,400
environment and not lose a crop some of

471
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,109
those guys who lost crops might have

472
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,390
lost half a million dollars and product

473
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:30,899
in that month which might have paid for

474
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,520
half paid for the upgraded build-out

475
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,110
that they could have or should have done

476
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,170
in the beginning and so this is really

477
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:37,000
an insurance

478
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,240
see especially when you're planning with

479
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,039
for your business to know that you're

480
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,349
not going to have a catastrophic failure

481
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,700
because you are ready to handle any

482
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:48,549
environmental thing that might come your

483
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,720
way is a huge benefit for your

484
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:56,710
operational success also collecting the

485
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,190
data enables you to to go to that date

486
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:02,890
of points where you are in trouble to

487
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,700
show that your conditions were actually

488
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:09,370
not causing the the problem because you

489
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,200
can go to if the dispensaries which in

490
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,819
you you see now in California this is

491
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,250
happening a lot millions of dollars

492
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:19,000
worth of products they're getting

493
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:23,019
recalled so the the growers can actually

494
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,690
fight for their rights if they have the

495
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:28,589
data enhance they can go to any day any

496
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:32,049
time and and show the conditions that

497
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:36,179
was growing this is also super important

498
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:39,159
for for growers to be able to to to show

499
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:44,350
the conditions of the climate which is

500
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:48,340
collecting data so I think it's quite

501
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:51,369
important also to show the energy levels

502
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:56,220
that you know that's getting used

503
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:59,589
we had a facility in in in Florida and

504
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,180
using a HVAC system from somebody else

505
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:04,659
and getting all these technologies

506
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,430
together at the end the energy costs and

507
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:12,360
the energy levels go really really high

508
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:17,680
and you know using efficient

509
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:20,740
technologies helps a lot with with and

510
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:26,950
quality of the product and how you get

511
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:29,730
to that quality much of this goes back

512
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,259
to initial planning and this you know

513
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,299
the more you plan in the early stages

514
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:36,609
the better off you're going to be with

515
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:41,009
the success of your project what we see

516
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:43,719
is in in Colorado indoor growers with

517
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:45,849
average HVAC controls are growing

518
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,579
between four thirty to fifty cents a

519
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:49,799
gram

520
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,779
a lot of our clients in the greenhouse

521
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,519
with a with a well-designed

522
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:56,309
HVAC system that's designed for

523
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,990
operational efficiency are growing for

524
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,940
us the last two cents to Graham in the

525
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,829
greenhouses part of that is because we

526
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,390
don't use light very much part of that

527
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:05,490
is because we have optimal conditions

528
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,560
because sunlight along with good

529
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,210
environmental controls so the plants are

530
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,099
totally out yielding what you might

531
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,660
normally see in an indoor grow and all

532
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,569
of those things bring down operational

533
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,790
costs so as wholesale prices drop over

534
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:20,579
time which they inevitably will the

535
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,769
greenhouse growers have a guaranteed

536
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,329
product at a low operational cost that

537
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:26,609
they know is gonna keep them in the game

538
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:28,529
longer whereas the guys who started

539
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:29,969
indoor which is maybe a thing that's

540
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:31,920
happening in Germany and how it had to

541
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,569
start in Colorado at the time the indoor

542
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,610
grocery that going out of business or

543
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:39,119
transitioning to a more controlled

544
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:42,809
better engineered designed greenhouse

545
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:46,500
situation the the initial investment

546
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:50,970
sometimes can be higher in in in let's

547
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,829
say ETF II is we actually recommend ETF

548
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,549
II a lot in the Middle East it's

549
00:24:52,829 --> 00:25:00,240
actually a really really good product

550
00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:02,309
it's better than glass and but it's a

551
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,599
little bit more expensive if I'm not

552
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:10,829
mistaken and it's it's it's up to up to

553
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:14,069
us to actually show why why the initial

554
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:16,679
investments are sometimes can be higher

555
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:19,919
and really important in in the long long

556
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,350
term I think this is what the growers

557
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,650
and people who wants to get into this

558
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:27,149
business should really think about and

559
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,850
plan it you were saying planning is

560
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,490
super important you should really know

561
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:35,459
on how advanced you want to go because

562
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,049
whereas in innovation goes it's not

563
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,380
stopping every day there is something

564
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:42,450
new coming out and and it's up to the

565
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:48,240
growers if they want to adapt that or

566
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:59,430
not so I beg you you use the innovations

567
00:25:48,240 --> 00:26:00,700
you know more and more now early on in

568
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,170
Colorado these were smaller

569
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,450
roars we're just trying to get into the

570
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:07,360
game for as little money as possible and

571
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,759
then survive and more and more now what

572
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,849
we see is much more organized business

573
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,519
groups who aren't as frightened to spend

574
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:17,500
the money but still concerned but it's

575
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,690
way more established now and so we see

576
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,609
people who are way more willing to make

577
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,470
the investment when we show them what

578
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:25,029
the outcome is and what the

579
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,210
possibilities are with the right

580
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:30,279
building and the right and the right

581
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:33,880
mechanical which is you would you agree

582
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:38,230
if I said which is mostly fully sealed

583
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,870
houses it is the best product I would I

584
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:43,750
would say most most most of the time or

585
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:45,969
fully controlled greenhouses you know as

586
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:49,089
in the egg sauce as an as an everything

587
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:53,019
so yeah we have so if you know the story

588
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:56,079
of Oregon right now Oregon has a huge

589
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:58,900
amount of outdoor or maybe greenhouse

590
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:01,119
grown cannabis that is ok quality that

591
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,769
is just sitting there like they say five

592
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:07,689
years worth of product yeah yeah more

593
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:09,730
than anybody they yeah they have like

594
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,100
four times the amount of weed if

595
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,900
everybody in Oregon was an everyday pot

596
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:15,939
smoker they would still have too much

597
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,300
weed right so I've offered to go up to

598
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:22,539
help but but the the idea there is

599
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:25,180
growing okay cannabis at this point is

600
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:28,420
really not a business plan at all it's

601
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,890
it's a it's a way to fail and so those

602
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,990
people who did not make the investment

603
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,600
in the way they're growing are paying

604
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:37,150
for it really like with everything they

605
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,709
have right now whereas the clients that

606
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,540
we have who've spent the most money

607
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,370
where people say this is actually you're

608
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:44,769
going way overboard it's ridiculous what

609
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:47,529
you're doing are getting 30 to 50

610
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:50,109
percent more wholesale per pound for

611
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:51,549
their product because it's such high

612
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:53,379
quality and when it comes out of the lab

613
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:54,759
results it shows that at such high

614
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,860
quality that's great that's fantastic

615
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,210
thank you both very much do we have time

616
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:01,389
for some questions you have a question

617
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,610
or two anyone have a question everyone

618
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,380
has used all of their words today well

619
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:07,539
thank you so very much Jim and Josh

620
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,220
let's hear for Jim and Josh I was very

621
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:11,220
enlightening very educational
