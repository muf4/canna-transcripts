growth after many years of slow what we

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,719
might call grinding progress I see a few

long awaited

22
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,478
momentum we're on the precipice it seems

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,679
to me of something

24
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:11,079
big um you know now more than ever the

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,080

26
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,879
really hot

27
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,959
commodity but what is an Emerging Market

28
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,719
what lessons can be learned from the

29
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,438
growth of other more mature markets what

30
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,239
are some of the key Emerging Markets we

31

00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,400
buckled in let's go for a ride on

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,439
Emerging

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
Markets I'm going to start if I can

81
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,120
Patty at the end with yourself I'm going

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
to put this question to you about the

83
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,640
market in Australia Australia was picked

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
as one of the fastest growing medical

85
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,199
cannabis markets in

86
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,238
2023 why did it grow so fast in your

87
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,359
opinion and what are the implications

88
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,360
for other emerging cannabis

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,840
markets I think it was really

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
interesting that Australia was selected

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
as one of the fastest growing markets

92
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,318
because it's so hard to get uh

93
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,119
transparent data on actually what is

94
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:51,878
happening in the market so um so that's

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,239
very interesting I think one of the

96
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:58,039
reasons that Australia has been so

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,360
successful is that we have um a very

98
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,039
good reputation for

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,599
uh drug development and uh

100
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,959
pharmaceutical

101
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:11,238
industry um experience and it's

102
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:16,000
recognized with all the other main

103
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:18,079
Regulators in the US and the um EU so

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,798
there's quite a few Mutual recognition

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,319
programs that we've been able to tap

106
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:26,359
into and I also think because we do so

107
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:30,038
much drug Discovery and um development

108
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:34,479
that when the our regulator the TGA went

109
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:37,120
to uh establish the prescribing Pathways

110
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,519
and the product access Pathways they

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,038
were very clever in that we already

112
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:46,079
already had a special access scheme uh

113
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:48,639
for unregistered medicine but we didn't

114
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,120
have the issue where in so many other

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,478
countries that GPS weren't able to

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,918
prescribe so they didn't limit as long

117
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,519
as the person was medically registered

118
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,560
be the person a GP or a specialist they

119
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,359
were both able to prescribe medicinal

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,199
cannabis and they also weren't specific

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,680
about the indications that you could

122
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,879
prescribe for so as long as the doctor

123
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,280
could clinically justify the indication

124
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,639
our approval our um regulator was happy

125
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,758
with that and then with the product

126
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,400
access Pathways I mean Australia is very

127
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,759
far from the rest of the world and so I

128
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,918
think um the way that when it was first

129
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,479
regul uh regulated there was obviously

130
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:37,318
no industry in Australia so they made um

131
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,318
import Pathways very um not easily

132
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,520
navigated but there was a pathway there

133
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,879
was an established pathway and it was

134
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,000
well defined so I think the combination

135
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:50,079
of having product accessible and

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,399
prescribers willing to prescribe really

137
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,680
helped us with the understanding of our

138
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,918
regulator that's great Patty thanks very

139
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,319
much and really I think highlights

140
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,359
really why Australia has become one of

141
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,280
the medical cannabis powerhouses in

142
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,120
terms of its growth and some of the key

143
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,000
facets there Zach turning to you as the

144
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
first G20 Nation to legalize

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,399
recreational Cannabis Canada's a great

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,680
case study for emerging markets in

147
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,478
Canada there have been challenges

148
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,000
related to product Supply over supply

149
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:22,478
retail saturation regulatory challenges

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,319
and so forth what should other Emerging

151
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,478
Markets consider in developing long-term

152
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,280
sustainability in a nent

153
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:33,079
market thanks David so you can come at

154
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,799
this from a couple angles um certainly

155
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,879
uh there's a lot to learn from in terms

156
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,079
of the Canadian case study first and

157
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,959
foremost when you compare it to one of

158
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:45,038
the larger and more mature markets um in

159
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,918
the US um Canada is an example of what

160
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,959
can occur when you have a national

161
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:53,560
market for flow so um there are some

162
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:57,038
signs and indications um at the physical

163
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,038
plant level um and in terms of costs and

164
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,120
the commodity risk that is inherent in

165
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,800
the space

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,639
that will certainly rear its head as we

167
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,800
get to Interstate Commerce um across the

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,478
us sometime in the future uh when it

169
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,319
when it the other factors that are very

170
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:14,399
relevant to Europe you know I think that

171
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,080
the the rampant over

172
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,519
licensing um which drove material over

173
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:23,120
Supply in Canada uh and the lack of

174
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,918
enforcement Believe It or Not which has

175
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,240
put the government in a position where

176
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:30,079
they are the um the largest creditor to

177
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,840
the industry in Canada

178
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,758
um is a real problem in fact the uh the

179
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:39,119
current state of aers when it comes to

180
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,120
excise tax in Canada um has become so

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,319
large that it's it's actually larger

182
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
than my estimate of what the wholesale

183
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,400
Market um would represent in Germany for

184
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:52,839
the entire year this year um so

185
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,399
seriously problematic um Canadian LPS

186
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,478
and participants in this industry have

187
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,158
gone through a lot of trauma in The Last

188
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:02,038
5 Years which which impacts memory um

189
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:04,199
but put a positive spin on it as well um

190
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,478
what you're seeing now is that the uh

191
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,598
like like any uh commodity Market uh

192
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:13,279
you're seeing branded product uh mean

193
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:17,360
much less to the consumer at retail uh

194
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:21,158
we we manage a portfolio of over about

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,319
190 um retail doors across Canada uh so

196
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:26,199
we can observe last year alone over 10

197
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,800
million consumer transactions and we see

198
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,000
an extreme willingness to switch so

199
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:38,080
brand awareness is still coming um in

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,278
our Market uh we have uh we have biomass

201
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,800
trading uh both domestically and

202
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:45,759
internationally below the marginal cost

203
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,639
of production so in many ways um the

204
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,519
pain that Canada has experienced um is

205
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,720
uring to the benefit of European markets

206
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,839
like Germany um that are accessing um

207
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,560
that that biomass and flour at quite

208
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,760
reasonable prices in some cases I was

209
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,559
speaking with an operator yesterday who

210
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,958
um surprisingly told me that they had

211
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:11,039
paid more for a lot of Spanish origin

212
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:13,559
outdoor grown flower than they had um a

213
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,480
lot of higher quality indoor you know

214
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,559
grown in Canada just to put things in

215
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,278
perspective that that's incredible and I

216
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,278
and I think one of the threads that's

217
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,000
starting to emerge already in with our

218
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,078
panelist responses is the important of

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
data you know so we'll definitely I

220
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:28,799
think you'll see that as a thread that

221
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,560
comes through more and more as we go

222
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,278
through the panel discussions here today

223
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,000
moving to something totally different

224
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,159
another part of the world in fact Co the

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
East and Southeast Asian markets such as

226
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,000
Thailand Japan Malaysia are making

227
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,480
significant strides with their medical

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,039
cannabis laws Thailand has gone under

229
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
much attention recently and was been

230
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,639
discussed earlier today in some of these

231
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,360
panels as an emerging market with what

232
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,039
we might call Tricky and evolving

233
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,879
regulations if there are indeed

234
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,000
regulations that that could be tricky

235
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,278
and evolving can you demystify

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,399
Thailand's cannabis regulations and

237
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,958
market for the audience okay thank you

238
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,399
David um medical cannabis has been Regal

239
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,559
in Thailand since 2018 and

240
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,879
decriminalization in

241
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,679
2022 took things step further Mak it

242
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:19,240
making it no longer a crime to grow and

243
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,719
trade marijuana and H products So

244
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,399
currently there are more than uh 5,000

245
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,959
dispensaries all over the Thailand

246
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,039
however a new uh government is planning

247
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,879
to ban the recreational economy so

248
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,719
under the new coming regulations Growers

249
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,639
and dispensaries will need to comply

250
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,800
with gscp and transform from

251
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,680
dispensaries to into clinics where

252
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:47,439
cannabis can only be prescribed by

253
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:49,919
licensed doctors with currently anybody

254
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,279
can sell cannabis uh products to

255
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,958
customers I expect further uh

256
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,720
registration that we both Safeguard and

257
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,039
Foster the growth of the medical

258
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,720
cannabis industry in Thailand to deliver

259
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,639
the safe and quality uh cannabis

260
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,920
products to the

261
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,919
patients excellent cooh thanks very much

262
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,679
and we're going to come on to the

263
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,599
Japanese Market a little bit later which

264
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,199
is another very interesting Market but

265
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,399
just coming to Rob to kind of finish the

266
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,480
first round of questions for the

267
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,679
panelists Rob comes in it from a little

268
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,959
bit of a different Outlook of course Rob

269
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,000
what are the biggest challenges

270
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,119
indigenous Le cannabis companies have in

271
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,958
expanding to International markets and

272
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,399
how can representative organizations

273
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:31,719
like the one you represent support them

274
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,799
yeah uh first thanks for being here I'm

275
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,079
grateful to be here um it's it's a

276
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,919
loaded question I think there's a little

277
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,958
context that has to be provided um you

278
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,879
know we're here as icia the indigenous

279
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,159
cannabis industry Association on behalf

280
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,078
of uh tribes that have signed resolution

281
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,240
of support for our trade Association to

282
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:52,078
activate tribes in the in the Cannabis

283
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,320
and hemp industry uh there's 574

284
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,199
independent Sovereign nations in the US

285
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,519
right now and there's indigenous Nations

286
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,839
across the world uh safety is Paramount

287
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,000
for our communities

288
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,360
um testing reg regulatory bodies we can

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,919
do all those things within the

290
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,600
jurisdictions of our own governments uh

291
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,199
so there's a massive opportunity for

292
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
tribes and they're activating there's

293
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,560
approximately 100 operating right now in

294
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,440
the US um First Nations we know are

295
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,958
operating as well and there's Sovereign

296
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,240
markets and there's open markets there's

297
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,359
a lot of comp complexity to the market

298
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,799
and also a lot of opportunity and for us

299
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,839
on the world stage it's about expressing

300
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:28,799
that we're open for business uh that we

301
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,160
are looking for partners um and really

302
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,759
ADV as well to elevate that this plant

303
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,679
really is a medicine and we have our own

304
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,838
uh sort of safety crisis Happening by

305
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,039
not uh moving this legislation forward

306
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,320
on a world

307
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,039
stage that's great Rob thanks very much

308
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,360
and I I think it's just so intriguing to

309
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,799
think about the the indigenous groups

310
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,639
and their involvement in the industry I

311
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,278
know in Canada it took some time to

312
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,159
develop but it has developed and it is

313
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:53,559
developing quite well now but you think

314
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,799
about other countries that might not be

315
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,879
an indigenous population but you you

316
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,198
think about other markets with the rasa

317
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,799
fari for example in Jama or Barbados

318
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:05,639
where there are religious or cultural

319
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,039
reasons why different groups have access

320
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,440
cannabis in different ways and there's a

321
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,559
lot of historical context to this as

322
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,199
well so I think in most markets Emerging

323
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,958
Markets you'll have interest groups or

324
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,759
other groups that need to be thought

325
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,719
about and navigated not to mention of

326
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,919
course the Legacy markets that occur in

327
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,320
each of the

328
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,879
jurisdictions um back across to you paty

329
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,959
again other side of the world here for a

330
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,320
few minutes how is the Australian

331
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,599
government assisting Australian cannabis

332
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,399
companies broadly speaking but more

333
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,360
specifically um in evaluating potential

334
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,559
export markets from

335
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,480
Australia um the government's been very

336
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:45,439
proactive in assisting companies in the

337
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,519
Cannabis space um a great example is we

338
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,920
have a booth here um the mcia has a

339
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,720
booth here at ICBC this is our third

340
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:56,120
year and we partner with global Victoria

341
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,959
which is one of our state governments

342
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,959
and so they fund the the booth and the

343
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,958
um everything that's required for the

344
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,719
booth and we bring a delegation every

345
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,919
year of Australian companies so that

346
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
they can interact with their

347
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,879
contemporaries around the world to build

348
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,519
those business Pathways the other thing

349
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,759
that um the different um departments

350
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,278
like we do a lot with the Department of

351
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,120
Health but also the Department of

352
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,439
Agriculture because this is a plant at

353
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,839
the end of the day and the Department of

354
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,759
Agriculture has actually given us a

355
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,160
$250,000 grant for for the MCI to

356
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:36,120
explore export opportunities and Export

357
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:38,639
markets for Australian companies so what

358
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,039
that means is that our scope of work is

359
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,240
to go around and see what are the short

360
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:47,240
medium and long-term prospects for our

361
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,039
medicinal cannabis products in Australia

362
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,839
to go to markets overseas and because

363
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:56,240
we're only a medicinal Market we can

364
00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:01,120
only export to countries that have

365
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,959
federally legal Medical cannabis markets

366
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,320
um so we cannot go we none of our

367
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:09,518
product can be diverted to adult use or

368
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,040
wreck markets so the um so the

369
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,360
Department of Agriculture has been very

370
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,879
supportive in assisting us to find

371
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,879
markets for the Australian manufacturers

372
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,240
of products that's great insights Patty

373
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,720
and I mean it it kind of comes back to

374
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,360
the idea of how plugged in is the

375
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,160
government how supportive is the

376
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,278
government in in Emerging Markets are

377
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,719
there um funding um you know allocations

378
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,399
allowed whether it be research Etc that

379
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,360
new on that topic yeah in Australia we

380
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:42,039
have a very good tax uh R&amp;D incentive

381
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,879
for any medical um uh clinical

382
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,639
development work that's gone that

383
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,759
happens in Australia there's a 48% tax

384
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,959
rebate so for every dollar spent you get

385
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,720
48 cents back on the dollar so there are

386
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,119
many of the pharmaceutical companies

387
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
that use Australia for their um contract

388
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,399
research

389
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,919
organizations great great intell Patty

390
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,120
thank you very much for that Zach coming

391
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,838
to you many Canadian companies are

392
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,679
exploring entrance into the United

393
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,399
States Market what emerging

394
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,958
opportunities are you looking at in the

395
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
states and do you think they'll face

396
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,198
similar challenges as seen in Canada and

397
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,920
a second part to this question just to

398
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,599
keep it tricky for you is sndl pursuing

399
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,159
opportunities in the United States or

400
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,040
additional Global

401
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:26,198
markets yeah I think in our case we've

402
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,039
gone through such a dramatic

403
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,519
transformation in the last three years

404
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,278
that people aren't aware Ware of our

405
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,759
current business model so in terms of uh

406
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,439
Canadian participants I think there's

407
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,519
the there's the narrative um and what's

408
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,160
being spoken about versus reality um so

409
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,759
there are very few Canadian participants

410
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,039
that have the wherewithal or the capital

411
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,000
resources to successfully enter the

412
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:53,679
market um we've seen a number of us

413
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,360
Brands um be brought up and experience

414
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,958
varying levels of success in Canada we

415
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,120
may one day um see the reverse happen

416
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,318
happen um you know there's always the

417
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,279
possibility that that a Tim Horton or

418
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:06,240
other classic Canadian brand could do

419
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,160
well

420
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,838
internationally um in our case we made a

421
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,880
decision early on um that as a NASDAQ

422
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,159
listed company that's prohibited from

423
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,360
engaging in plant touching activities in

424
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,640
the US that we would gain exposure

425
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:25,318
through credit so we deployed over $500

426
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,439
million CAD um into a series of secured

427
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:30,399
um credit positions in the US against

428
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,519
top msos and a few of those as they've

429
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,038
experienced um Financial wos are being

430
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,319
restructured and we will end up as

431
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,879
either super majority or 100% owners of

432
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,359
those businesses down the

433
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,880
road great Insight Zach thanks very much

434
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,000
for that um cooh we'll come to you on

435
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,520
Japan as I mentioned earlier Japan is

436
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,079
currently active on the medical cannabis

437
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,240
regulatory front can you provide an

438
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,639
update um on the laws in future

439
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,519
medicinal Market in in Japan thank you

440
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,320
David um in December 23 Japan passed RMA

441
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,359
can Reform Bill which is expected to be

442
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:11,480
fully implemented by the end of

443
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:15,119
2024 the new regulations are very clear

444
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,720
only prescribed medicines like epids

445
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:22,079
that have been approved by the Japanese

446
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:25,679
FDA are legal while smoking cannabis

447
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,038
remains illegal for even for medical use

448
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,798
so I think this legalization is still

449
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:33,079
the good opportunity for the Japanese

450
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:36,000
people to know the medical benefit and

451
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:38,439
efficacy of cannabis While most of the

452
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,119
Japanese people think cannabis is still

453
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,960
just Dr since we have been brainwashed

454
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:48,199
by uh you know propaganda for after

455
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,240
World War II so uh this represents a

456
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,120
significant opportunity for biotech

457
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,880
companies specializing in the Canino

458
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,918
medicine particularly those are already

459
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:02,440
in phase two or phase three of clinical

460
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,600
Char and already approved by Foreign

461
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,279
fdas in the Western World this crucial

462
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,199
because development of new medicines

463
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:14,798
from scratch can often take more than 10

464
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,120
to 15 years this Advantage is especially

465
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,599
remarkable considering the Japanese s

466
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,759
FDA policy of requiring approval even

467
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,240
for Dr that have already been approved

468
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,798
by forign

469
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,480
fds introducing Canabis uh can medicine

470
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,558
that already an advantage stage has the

471
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,759
potential to speed the introduction and

472
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:39,798
use of canid based medicine to patients

473
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:42,359
in Japan this approach can provide quick

474
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:45,158
access to effective uh treatments

475
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:47,839
leveraging this uh ground work rate by

476
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,080
extensive research and testing already

477
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,519
complet completed in the other countries

478
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,918
I'm very keen to develop cannaboid

479
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,759
medicine in partnership with Western

480
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,400
companies particularly often drugs for

481
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:04,079
epilepsy D syndrome and Parkinson's

482
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,919
disease which doesn't have effective uh

483
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,279
effective treatment so far great cooh

484
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,440
thanks very much and it's that that

485
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,319
Japanese Market is pretty intriguing and

486
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,240
again though we get the idea that

487
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,720
different markets are going to take

488
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,558
different shapes the Japanese Market

489
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,679
will be a pharmaceutically driven Market

490
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,798
in a similar vein let say to New Zealand

491
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,960
or to UK to a degree would that be

492
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:29,158
correct yeah right uh Japan will be uh

493
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,640
the big one of the biggest eom medicine

494
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:35,480
Market if Japanese people wants to take

495
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,159
any kind of know substances for medical

496
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,400
use there's only option you know the

497
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,280
pharmaceutical medicines yeah right very

498
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,679
clear for sure and then you look at

499
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,399
other other markets and they're more

500
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,880
hybrid markets you might even call them

501
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,798
preck markets if you wanted to coin uh

502
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,559
you know a term for them so I think when

503
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,440
you're looking at emerging markets and

504
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,519
deciding as a business where you want to

505
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,960
go or how you want to partner up or

506
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,119
where your product mix today and

507
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,200
tomorrow May fit looking at the

508
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,359
orientation of the regulatory scheme in

509
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,360
those markets is really really critical

510
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,918
and obviously Japan will be a intriguing

511
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,678
Market with a pharmaceutical bent if you

512
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:14,159
will um Rob coming across to yourself

513
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,400
how does tribal sovereignty and autonomy

514
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,880
autonomy un uniquely positioned

515
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
indigenous cannabis businesses in

516
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,360
navigating the complex legal landscape

517
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,240
of the Cannabis industry especially

518
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:28,319
concerning global

519
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:32,558
trade yeah um there's just a lot in the

520
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:34,759
US is you know it's a [ __ ] show um so um

521
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,558
as we're all collecting data here data

522
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,158
points are what we need uh in Indian

523
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:42,119
Country to move policy within our own uh

524
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,760
reservation boundaries uh these are 574

525
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:45,119
Sovereign Nations so they're independent

526
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,240
and they have their own ideals they have

527
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,719
their own Geographic locations so kind

528
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,240
of starting there um and making sure

529
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,880
that you know the house is in order

530
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,519
before you're you know moving in another

531
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,919
Direction um so I think on this world

532
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,839
stage as as why we're here there's

533
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,200
traditional plant medicine rights that

534
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,519
our communities have innately since time

535
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,679
Memorial and I think as far as what we

536
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,000
can bring to the table on a world stage

537
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,038
is that perspective and that sort of

538
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,038
lobbying interest of having indigenous

539
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,960
Nations at the table advocating for this

540
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,599
plant medicine so I think that's one

541
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,519
opportunity where the indigenous uh

542
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:23,399
value is is looming large and it's

543
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,599
moving rather quickly I think the other

544
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
aspect of that is talking to friends in

545
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,639
Canada talking about building capacity

546
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,679
for the tribes talking about developing

547
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,400
not just um you know an industry but

548
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,600
also a Workforce for economic

549
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,200
development for sustainable uh Legacy of

550
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,839
benefits for these communities is

551
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,840
critically important to the indigenous

552
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:45,439
community and that's one of the you know

553
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,439
reasons we're here as well we feel

554
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,038
Europe is further ahead than we are

555
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,080
right now us is sort of sitting in a

556
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:53,720
very static phase states are all you

557
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,879
know checkerboard across across the

558
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,759
country so we're also learning watching

559
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,320
and Gathering as much information as we

560
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,359
can and really looking for partners who

561
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,200
can provide an objective view to what

562
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,399
the global market looks like compared to

563
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,880
the fodder that we're receiving in the

564
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,360
US thanks Robin before we leave you

565
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,120
maybe say a couple of words about like

566
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,000
free trade zones with respect to

567
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,439
indigenous groups and things it's a very

568
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,240
broad topic but a couple of words from

569
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,240
you would be great on that subject sure

570
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,120
you know Sovereign Nations have the

571
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,839
ability to establish free trade zones

572
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,879
for import export with reduced duties

573
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,439
and customs fees uh these SE are all

574
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,159
opportunities that tribal Nations have

575
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,000
as ferally ferally recognized Nations

576
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,480
they also have the the ability to get

577
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,960
DEA licenses as well for uh just

578
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,798
self-regulating and and moving medicine

579
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,038
uh at a higher level so uh these are all

580
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,480
areas and and advantages that tribes

581
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,200
have that because of lack of capacity

582
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,240
and legal backbone instructure and fear

583
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,600
of repercussion they've failed to move

584
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,200
in these directions aggressively but

585
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,918
they are getting more bold now as

586
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,840
they've gotten organized and started to

587
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,038
pool resources

588
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,158
excellent Rob thanks very much for

589
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,319
sharing that I think it's a really

590
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,919
important subject and you educated me on

591
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,558
it before the panel and I was I did some

592
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,480
extra reading it was very very

593
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,960
intriguing um questions to Patty across

594
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,440
to yourself here um and maybe this is a

595
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,840
good one for folks in the audience to

596
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,798
who are looking to kind of choose

597
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:18,879
markets and and plan their next

598
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,918
strategic moves What markets in your

599
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,640
view Patty hold the greatest potential

600
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,240
for Australian cannabis companies

601
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,399
besides their home

602
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,359
Market well since we can only export to

603
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:34,959
federally legal pharmaceutical markets

604
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:39,000
we're kind of limited as to where we can

605
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,440
go um so the things that we look for in

606
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,720
when we're um exploring potential export

607
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,399
markets are um what is the regulatory

608
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,679
pathway um and if there is some sort of

609
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:55,000
um Beach head or some sort of um

610
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,640
collaboration that the mcia can

611
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
spearhead on behalf of the company is

612
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,038
for a um product

613
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,839
registration um so we so we look at what

614
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:09,119
the regulatory pathways are obviously

615
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:13,918
the size of the country what their

616
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:16,558
framework is and uh what the what the

617
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,640
logistical um expertise and Regulatory

618
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,359
expertise are required um in order to

619
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,919
get there some of the markets we export

620
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:29,000
quite a bit to Germany um from Australia

621
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,399
um we send some to the UK

622
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,038
and we're also um I think Poland is

623
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,839
another Market that some of the

624
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,558
Australian companies will really look at

625
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,798
great great insights Patty thanks very

626
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,798
much and again the importance of that

627
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,038
understanding the regulatory environment

628
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:45,038
the orientation of the regs

629
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,919
pharmaceutical or potentially not quite

630
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,679
so heavy that direction is so key to

631
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,000
choosing these markets right and I think

632
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,038
one of the other markets that's going to

633
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,440
be really interesting and I think Paul

634
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:56,960
from little green farmer a fellow Aussie

635
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,558
who spoke earlier today is the French

636
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,840
market so you know they're doing their

637
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,798
trial you know I believe the trial is

638
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,678
wrapped up um they're going to figure

639
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,839
out what sort of framework um they'll do

640
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,038
it the French way of course um but yeah

641
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:17,038
watching that market and seeing how for

642
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,599
their trial obviously they had um they

643
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,599
had to import product because they're

644
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,319
not making any locally so there's going

645
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:26,439
to be an an export from Australia import

646
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:29,319
into France pathway that's going to be

647
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,960
established by that trial

648
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,439
great Patty thanks very much so let's

649
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,600
put move across to Zach for a quick

650
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,320
question on kind of um what advice that

651
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,839
you would give to new cannabis companies

652
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:45,439
looking to gain market

653
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:48,240
share Glo global market

654
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,960
share it's it's a broad and complex

655
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,038
question thank you for that one um I

656
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,399
just just as Patty had uh referenced I

657
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:58,398
think understanding the regulatory

658
00:26:55,398 --> 00:27:00,558
framework in each given Market is really

659
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,558
critical um it it could be as much as

660
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:05,960
70% or more of the battle at the end of

661
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:08,158
the day and uh what we've seen in Canada

662
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,079
um there was certainly a very high level

663
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,799
of exuberance uh as we went into a wreck

664
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:18,519
legal or adult use uh Marketplace just

665
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:22,798
over 5 years ago it drew in um uh

666
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,960
entrepreneurs of all ilks some with um

667
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,398
long-standing uh Business and

668
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,759
Professional backgrounds some who are

669
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:31,599
willing to risk

670
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,158
um everything that they had saved um to

671
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:38,519
uh get into that market while many would

672
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,600
regard this plant as somewhat magic um

673
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,359
this industry these businesses um do

674
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,759
submit to the laws of gravity um

675
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,479
understanding the entire supply chain in

676
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,200
the markets in which you either are

677
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,880
operating or are looking to operate is

678
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,440
critical understanding where the

679
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,080
economics fall where bottlenecks are

680
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,960
where risk really lies I think is

681
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:00,278
critical to success uh and and also not

682
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,319
trying to be all things to all people

683
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,359
what what we recognized in Canada was if

684
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,398
if if the adult use Market was designed

685
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:10,000
in in such a manner that the um the only

686
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:12,278
point of contact effectively between the

687
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,398
consumer and THC products was going to

688
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,839
be at retail that if you if you wanted

689
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:19,398
to own the consumer relationship having

690
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:21,720
a very strong presence Downstream in

691
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:24,759
retail was going to be critical um and

692
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,399
we moved aggressively in that direction

693
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,200
that's great Insight Zach thanks very

694
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,278
much and again so helpful to get ins

695
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,798
sites from from individuals and

696
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:34,000
companies that have navigated some of

697
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,240
these choppy Waters and can bring us a

698
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,398
bit of bit of help as we look at

699
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,759
emerging markets and how to decipher

700
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:42,079
choosing directions Etc cooh a question

701
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,038
across to yourself we'll get a couple

702
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,678
more questions here then we'll go out

703
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,599
for audience questions as well um how

704
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,440
long do you think it will be before we

705
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:54,558
see this kind of long awaited um

706
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:59,320
stabilization on the regulatory front in

707
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:02,359
Thailand well uh actually I don't no and

708
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:05,960
I don't think the some people uh saying

709
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:09,439
that uh the the cannabis plant will go

710
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,200
back to be a narcotic plant but I don't

711
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,880
think it might not happen and everybody

712
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,319
hope so and this new regulation when it

713
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,399
will be

714
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:24,558
installed I really don't

715
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:28,199
know PE you know

716
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:31,119
that he he's my he's a tie grower and is

717
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,600
one of the best you know that everyone's

718
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,000
waiting for that

719
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:39,678
gold the best genetic supper in Jan you

720
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,919
know that I don't think anybody knows

721
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,480
that that's great cooh thanks very much

722
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,960
for sharing that one one final question

723
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,079
Rob to yourself I think we have a little

724
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,640
bit of time for questions because we

725
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,319
were nipped for about five minutes by

726
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,799
the our previous friends on the previous

727
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,200
panel with the evolving legal landscape

728
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:56,200
and increasing Market opportunities what

729
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,000
future directions do you envision for

730
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,759
the indigenous cannabis industry both

731
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,119
domestically and

732
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,798
internationally well to become friends

733
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:08,199
with Zach and and figure out how to you

734
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:09,679
know be pragmatic about what launches

735
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,120
look like but also figure out ways to

736
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,519
access capital and there's some things

737
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,239
that are built into Indian country that

738
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:20,000
just don't work uh you know we we were

739
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,440
given gaming um in the US and uh able to

740
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,839
regulate that through IGA but we're also

741
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,640
told that we can't use any of those

742
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,558
profits towards cannabis um so right so

743
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,038
there's to get around that um but I

744
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:34,038
think it really is about problem solving

745
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:37,038
and when I talk about you know capacity

746
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:39,038
building and tribal governments um our

747
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,319
tribal governments are in charge of

748
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,319
every facet of government you know and

749
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,000
that includes business so creating an

750
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,319
economic development committee to create

751
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,200
a business development committee to move

752
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,439
towards a cannabis operation while

753
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,480
they're making sure their housing and

754
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,000
health care and legal is all taken care

755
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,079
of this is a lot for a tribe to manage

756
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
so trusted partners are something that

757
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,519
we have been trying to vet since our

758
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,759
organization's been around for 3 years

759
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,679
because there have been a lot of Bad

760
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,519
actors out in Indian Country doing bad

761
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,278
things for years and years and years

762
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,960
just around cannabis not talking about

763
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:11,558
other things but specifically for this

764
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,278
um we are positioned with 70% of the

765
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:15,079
existing landbase left in the United

766
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,119
States we have sovereignty we have

767
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,720
self-determination we can self-regulate

768
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,518
as an independent nation so in my

769
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,480
opinion that's a that's a massive

770
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,960
Advantage excellent Robin I'm not going

771
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,558
to argue with you thanks very much for

772
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,038
that so I think we've got a few minutes

773
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,119
for questions we'll hand across yeah

774
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:33,079
let's hear for the

775
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,079
panel who's got a

776
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:38,439
question anyone got a qu oh Bo has a

777
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,240
question Bo always has good questions

778
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,240
it's Bo Woodley everybody all right here

779
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,240
I go I'm on my

780
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,638
way hey this is very interesting guys so

781
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,240
thanks for your contributions to this um

782
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:58,158
to this conference um in the United

783
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,638
States and elsewhere um medical cannabis

784
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,880
is usually viewed as a springboard into

785
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:07,798
adult use and so for those like in

786
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,480
Australia or Japan you've got medical

787
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:14,398
now well limited Medical in Japan do you

788
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:19,038
think that in in the future that will

789
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:21,359
serve as a springboard to full adult use

790
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,038
legalization PTI Co would you like to

791
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:28,398
have a go with that one yeah I'll have a

792
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:30,278
crack um hi B nice to see you again um I

793
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,278
I think when you when we're talking

794
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:35,240
about medicinal cannabis as we all know

795
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,200
there's so many there's such a wide

796
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,519
array of indications that it can be used

797
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,480
for and there's also

798
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,599
um the different formats so I think the

799
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,200
anything that's in a more for

800
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:52,199
pharmaceutical format such as the soft

801
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,919
gels or the tinctures or even the pasel

802
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,240
the

803
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,919
gummies I don't think that will lead uh

804
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,000
that will segue from medicinal into

805
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,840
adult use what we're currently seeing in

806
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,558
Australia um due to the due to a number

807
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:10,158
of factors you know the falling price to

808
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,839
Consumer um the ease of actually getting

809
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,278
a prescription now because there's more

810
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:18,038
doctors that are willing to prescribe um

811
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:20,359
there are some uh uh patients there are

812
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:23,759
people who are using illicit product who

813
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:26,599
are now switching to LIT product because

814
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,759
access is easier and the quality of the

815
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:32,798
product is better

816
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:36,079
I don't when I think of um medicinal use

817
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:39,398
verse um recreational use I think about

818
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:42,439
the intent behind the use of the product

819
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:44,918
so I look at someone who's um buying

820
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,558
illicit product to help them go to sleep

821
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:50,360
at night or help quell their anxiety so

822
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:51,960
it's not about the um the type of

823
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,879
product they're taking it's about their

824
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,600
intention to use so I think if we bear

825
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,799
in mind that people people use cannabis

826
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:04,678
and medicinal cannabis for different

827
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:06,839
purposes I don't think in Australia

828
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:10,960
we're going to have a great shift

829
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:14,559
towards adult use in my opinion it's at

830
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,878
least five possibly 10 years away any

831
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,878
other thoughts from panelists on the

832
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:25,199
