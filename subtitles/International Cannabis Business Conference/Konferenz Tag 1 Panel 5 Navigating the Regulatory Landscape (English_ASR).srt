for all of us it's uh it's a pleasure to

00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,699
um regulatory landscape and navigating

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,859
unit is kind of something I've been slid

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,839
I slid in through into over the last

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,640
couple of years

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,859
um I'll share a bit more about that in a

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,060
second I'd like to give my esteemed

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,880
colleagues here a chance to introduce

12
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,939
themselves before we jump into the panel

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,618
and share a bit of our insights what has

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,980
happened in the world so far and where

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,960
this is hopefully going and see if we

16
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,058
can actually make sense of this industry

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,259

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,659
vaping and then I switched over to true

36
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:28,019
terpenes and created their toxicology

37
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,659
program with all that research I've been

38
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,219
able to educate lawmakers and regulators

39
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,700
and help actually write the language

40
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:38,819
that goes into laws and then also I've

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,978
been able to support manufacturers if it

42

internationally as well happy to be here

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,860
well absolute pleasure

79
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,379
um a bit about what what brought me into

80
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,980
this industry and and kind of will lead

81
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:25,318
into this in a second is as being from

82
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,818
Switzerland and always seeing you know

83
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,339
what is Canada doing what is the US

84
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,839
doing and the Trailblazers of the

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,640
industry what are the regulatory

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,420
Frameworks what are their standards what

87
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,878
were the different question marks and uh

88
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,579
between that realized that it didn't

89
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,560
speak a harmonized language what was

90
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,159
done in the U.S didn't really speak to

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,860
at the time how I saw European medical

92
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,560
at least and and other standards kind of

93
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,379
uh can be can be harmonized in the back

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
end and that led them to me kind of

95
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:00,120
starting something something from

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,299
scratch and trying to really bring those

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,459
different uh well regulatory Frameworks

98
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,080
is a big word but uh well you have

99
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,719
standardization and you have different

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,540
parts that feed into that

101
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:15,120
um and uh well bringing those together

102
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,339
and and harmonizing certain points there

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,139
was one of the big things that I put on

104
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:24,299
my uh uh cap and with having you know a

105
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,960
couple of the esteemed gentlemen lady

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,478
over here uh Sean you've been very

107
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,680
outspoken early in this how can you

108
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,659
bring standards how can you bring

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,459
regulatory Frameworks what were some of

110
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,500
the early Channel challenges you saw

111
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,359
over there and how did you to bring the

112
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,939
industry into this and what were your

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,800
approaches and and what can you share

114
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,800
from from those early days

115
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,660
so the early days of regulations one

116
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,840
thing that I noticed in

117
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,380
they're getting better at now is using

118
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,359
very umbrella terms to create

119
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,639
regulations and a lot of times they

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,800
don't understand everything that falls

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,740
under that umbrella term so they tend to

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,520
over regulate Beyond even what the

123
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,280
lawmakers are intending to and then

124
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:18,240
oftentimes

125
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:21,000
they are regulating with the uh you know

126
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,180
with the message of safety Consumer

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,339
safety but most of the time Regulators

128
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,038
do not have any scientific background at

129
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,138
all so these laws don't actually protect

130
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,300
the health and safety of consumers so a

131
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,538
lot of what I've done is to educate them

132
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,740
on this is how you write regulations to

133
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:39,740
protect your end consumer

134
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,198
I don't know where they have been also

135
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,899
very engaged in the early days anything

136
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,759
that you remember from back then that we

137
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,739
now in Europe were at this stage where

138
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,660
we can you know we can still influence

139
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,120
we can actually we're part of this

140
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,300
process what can we learn from back then

141
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,060
that we can kind of move into

142
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,259
I think that for a lot of us who are

143
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,538
coming from North America here to

144
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,100
Germany and learning about the

145
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:08,038
regulatory framework that's coming into

146
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,720
play here based on this beautiful leak

147
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,639
um the alarm Bells I think are ringing

148
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,199
for us and I think there are a lot of

149
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,319
lessons learned that we've seen from

150
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,180
other markets that if Germany doesn't

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,939
think about implementing very seriously

152
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,759
you know after pillar one and pillar two

153
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,038
or even throughout this process are

154
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,800
going to result in a framework that

155
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,180
ultimately will fail I think there's

156
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,180
some very very important considerations

157
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,160
and there are some major gaps and some

158
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,840
of those gaps I think include you know

159
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,919
number one for what all good robust Fair

160
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,138
regulation should really include and

161
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,139
that some means of restorative justice

162
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,680
and that can include elements of social

163
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,300
Equity it can include putting those in

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,459
line who are affected by cannabis

165
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,038
prohibition

166
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:58,258
it must include a means of safe reliable

167
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,259
access for patients and I haven't seen

168
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,538
any means of how Germany at this point

169
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,699
intends to transition those from the

170
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:09,019
illicit Market or the Cannabis movement

171
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,020
into this new market

172
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,879
no applause yet excellent uh excellent

173
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,579
excellent points Lucas I think I'd echo

174
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,899
in addition to what Lucas is is already

175
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,098
said you know I think it's very

176
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,258
important for us to look back

177
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:24,360
particularly from a European perspective

178
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,460
that's what what's happened previously

179
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,660
and what is happening before we can go

180
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,758
forward so when you look at medical

181
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,080
cannabis in Europe to your point Luke on

182
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,879
harmonization

183
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,279
still a lack of harmonization across

184
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,639
Europe right I mean harmonization is a

185
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,899
pillar of the European Union and the

186
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,639
fact that we don't have a single

187
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,399
monograph of flower which has been

188
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,199
talked about for the last three years is

189
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,959
is ridiculous you've got you know what

190
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,639
seven eight plus European countries that

191
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,019
are all selling cannabis flour and have

192
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
been for the last

193
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,799
you know over six seven years where

194
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,259
there's no harmonized framework so if

195
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,620
you're a cultivator or a producer that

196
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,259
operates anywhere you've got you know

197
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,660
arguably 10 12 up to 20 different

198
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,280
Frameworks you need to follow Germany is

199
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,199
completely different from Poland it's

200
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,698
completely different from Denmark it's

201
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,079
completely different from Switzerland so

202
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,900
if you're trying to sell the same flower

203
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,698
into those five markets you've got five

204
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,739
sets of regulatory Frameworks to follow

205
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,139
and that never happens in Europe right

206
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,720
Europe is all about harmonization so I

207
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,819
think it the dialogue with Regulators is

208
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,039
critically important right now to be

209
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,620
having not only at a national level but

210
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,479
also at a European commission level and

211
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,700
it's incumbent on companies now to start

212
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,620
holding Regulators feed to the fire to

213
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,180
actually make that happen and make sure

214
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,158
there's at a minimum there's no

215
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,439
explanation why there isn't a European

216
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,299
monograph for flower currently so then

217
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,100
you've got to start and fix the medical

218
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,199
program before you can start to

219
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,139
speculate and what's happening is pure

220
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,360
speculation on a recreational program

221
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,939
yeah I think that those are great points

222
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,440
I mean there's you know just like we we

223
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,360
saw in the U.S

224
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,420
um with this Patchwork of regulations

225
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,159
let's just take CBD for example you know

226
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,319
you have 50 different states

227
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,819
um with very different policies

228
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,440
um different products that they do allow

229
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,320
don't allow and we're seeing that same

230
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,600
type of you know Patchwork framework

231
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,278
um that you know now um in Europe um

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,339
that has that has really been imported

233
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,679
and creates a whole lot of issues from

234
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,360
you know THC levels in hemp

235
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,338
um you know at least in the U.S it's a

236
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,639
pretty standardized under the federal

237
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:32,040
law but you know we now see any anywhere

238
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,838
from point two percent you know now uh

239
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,360
member states now moving up to 0.3 but

240
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,800
then we have you know countries like

241
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,620
Switzerland CZ Republic at one percent

242
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,639
you know these these just creates all

243
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,759
kinds of

244
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,379
um you know hurdles for the industry

245
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,819
um you know one thing that I do think

246
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,500
that is interesting and even we don't

247
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,879
have to go far you know as far back as

248
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,679
the early days

249
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,480
um you know in North America you know

250
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,000
what we're seeing happen with what we

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,139
call ihdc's intoxicating him derived

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,299
cannabinoids such as Delta 8 hhc

253
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,039
um you know it does seem that at least

254
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,319
Europe is kind of learning some of the

255
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,939
lessons that from some of the maybe

256
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,980
missteps that have been happening in the

257
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,300
U.S with these these products where it

258
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,720
is just completely all over the board

259
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:18,838
from you know Statewide bands to the DEA

260
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,060
doesn't know really what the status is

261
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,860
um and then you know but at least Europe

262
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,479
I will say you know has been able to

263
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,440
react a bit better they have some better

264
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,159
mechanisms in place to be able to

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,720
you know address these new psychoactive

266
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,120
substances

267
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,980
um and so you know there are a lot of

268
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,320
missteps I think in the U.S when it came

269
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,300
to that where they ended up you know

270
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,459
started having very unintended

271
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,278
consequences like I believe Washington

272
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,559
with CBN where they wanted to kind of

273
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,419
ban the semi-synthetic process but then

274
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,778
they realized actually that's how a lot

275
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,759
of the CBN on that the market uh is so

276
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:59,458
um but yeah at least I think Europe and

277
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,559
in kind of that aspect has learned a

278
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,018
little bit but um still kind of I think

279
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,359
making some of the same mistakes that

280
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,919
were made in the US in particular you'd

281
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,360
have to try very hard to do worse than

282
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,419
what we have in the U.S you have to try

283
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,360
very hard I would just piggyback of what

284
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:18,599
Anthony said on on CBD and I think

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,639
the lack of global regulation or

286
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,259
misregulation on CBD is probably one of

287
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,419
the the worst things that we have in the

288
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,120
industry because you look at CBD you

289
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,799
know it's available everywhere

290
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,240
U.S that's available Canada is

291
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,740
completely screwed up the regulation of

292
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,720
CBD in my opinion because we've

293
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,000
regulated the same as THC which makes no

294
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,379
sense uh and you've got the you know

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,419
you've got the European union now that's

296
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,778
going on this novel Foods pathway which

297
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,639
is great except that no one has Clarity

298
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:47,399
on the novel Foods pathway you know I've

299
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,159
got clients that are wanting to apply

300
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,480
for an FSA application and FSI just

301
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,100
keeps raising the bar you know you need

302
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,600
to do human trials they need to do

303
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,360
animal trials that you need to get into

304
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,100
human pregnancy trials I mean it's CBD

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,259
for crying out loud meanwhile it's

306
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,320
available everywhere so the global lack

307
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,958
of regulation on CBD is just benign and

308
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,940
before you can start to regulate THC and

309
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,219
look at recreational Cannabis we've got

310
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,200
to fix some existing challenges and you

311
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,000
can't make the bower so high that you're

312
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
going to have an illicit Market you know

313
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,100
try live or in the case of CBD just an

314
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,240
unregulated Market Drive

315
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,420
now we've seen CBD big issues big

316
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,539
different approaches big well this

317
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:32,639
harmonization I would like to say

318
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:35,879
we touched a little bit the the medical

319
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,500
side yes when I started with with

320
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,139
creating the software I was like okay

321
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,700
where do you go so my what I do is kind

322
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,578
of trying to harmonize standards to

323
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,680
through transparency and technology and

324
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:49,739
it was like the easiest thing to do is

325
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,539
EU GMP because it's the most defined

326
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,860
of course it's the hardest to reach it's

327
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,838
the most processes it's the most

328
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,120
different steps and so forth but at

329
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,220
least you have a guidebook and in all

330
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,600
those other parts there is no guidebook

331
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,339
and

332
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,079
um I did have the pleasure a little bit

333
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,420
too or the pleasure the owner whatever

334
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,659
you want to call it to to be involved in

335
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:11,819
some of these working groups

336
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:13,620
in several countries and and a big part

337
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,480
there was and that's my personal

338
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,879
experience and I'd like to hear a bit

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,399
more from from your side was whenever

340
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,578
the industry came together and gave kind

341
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,240
of a coherent thought through uh based

342
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:29,219
on other examples input be it you know

343
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,259
looking at the tobacco industry looking

344
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,180
at other Industries looking at best case

345
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,399
practices looking at you know

346
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,078
standardization in in food health safety

347
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,700
standards and so forth whenever the

348
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,278
industry came together and really

349
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,839
thought through proposed something be it

350
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,278
through associations be it through

351
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,800
individuals that were a bit you know

352
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,600
more active in certain parts I've always

353
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,419
had the experience that the ears were

354
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,399
very open now now we all have a lot of

355
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,500
friends in the industry that all they do

356
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,000
is complain every day and this is one of

357
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,399
the moments where I you know look into

358
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,159
the audience and say if you really want

359
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,320
to navigate not just through the

360
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,939
regulatory landscape as it comes if you

361
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,100
want to try to

362
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,620
paved the way a little bit in your

363
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,320
direction it really helps to come

364
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,600
together and you know gather some

365
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,459
thoughts and I know there's a lot of

366
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,800
people on stage here that have been

367
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,018
involved in in several approaches there

368
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,838
if you could give you know one or two

369
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:28,019
advices towards the industry at this

370
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,700
moment right now in Europe where we

371
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,560
still are at the point where we can have

372
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,540
influence we can still learn from the

373
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,179
mistakes that were made we don't have to

374
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,458
go down the same routes we don't have to

375
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,620
you know try to copy paste the framework

376
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,899
that allowed for 400 tons overproduction

377
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,919
or 70 percent elicit after 10 years and

378
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,360
so forth so uh any you know short advice

379
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,120
that you would give to the audience

380
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,300
based on the learnings that you had from

381
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,399
you know the US and Canada what can we

382
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,439
do now here in Europe at this stage

383
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,958
where The Regulators are very open the

384
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,459
ears are open we can bring the input yes

385
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,599
there was a leaked draft I can tell you

386
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,518
that draft is not what's going to go

387
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,159
into action and there is the working

388
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,039
groups very active in there so any two

389
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,078
cents what can we do now to kind of not

390
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,519
complain after

391
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,919
well I think one of the biggest things

392
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,778
is uh is is lobbying right I think

393
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,179
you've got to work you've got to be able

394
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:24,419
to work with your your politicians your

395
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:26,159
local MPS mlas MEPS uh on the European

396
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,799
Parliament level you've got to start

397
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,838
engaging with them I think what has

398
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,458
happened in Canada is we've seen that

399
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,040
now companies are starting to really get

400
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,899
after the government but really weren't

401
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,939
proactively doing as much as perhaps

402
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,458
they could have for example the dairy

403
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,680
industry in Canada is severely regulated

404
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:46,138
and when they went through their crisis

405
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,519
on taxation I'm not advocating for

406
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,560
killing animals but they actually took

407
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,778
cows to the legislature and started

408
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,039
shooting them in front of politicians to

409
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:55,259
say this is what you're actually doing

410
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,419
you're killing our industry we have we

411
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,100
have no choice because I can't keep

412
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,479
these cows around and so like you've got

413
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,879
to make sure you're really getting in

414
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,759
the face of politicians and telling them

415
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,620
why regulatory change is important I

416
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,819
think on a European side you've got to

417
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,198
do the same thing you've got to learn

418
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,360
from the mistakes that have been made in

419
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,679
places like Canada and there is many

420
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,820
mistakes that have been made and there's

421
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,439
certainly really some really good things

422
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,240
that have been adopted so you got to be

423
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,519
presenting both sides of that coin very

424
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,720
early on taxation is a huge one I you

425
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,360
know there isn't a lot of conversation

426
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,399
happening around taxation but I trust me

427
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,159
once governments start get used to that

428
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,600
tax dollars it's very hard to to take

429
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,338
that back and we're seeing that in

430
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,720
Canada so I think that sort of

431
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,579
conversation needs to start happening

432
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,778
early companies that are raising money

433
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,939
and some have raised a lot of money

434
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:40,679
needs to start engaging regulators and

435
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,720
saying here's a report just make sure

436
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,338
you don't tax it and really coming and

437
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,839
making that public and engaging with

438
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,839
politicians on it

439
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,839
yeah I would yeah Echo exactly what you

440
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,180
said I mean I think that you know if

441
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,380
um you know legalization is to truly

442
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,758
happen

443
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,799
um that there has to be an empowerment

444
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,180
to have the political courage to get it

445
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,458
across the line

446
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:05,039
um and what I mean by that is

447
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:07,500
um you know we've now seen it unfold in

448
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,298
in Germany where falling back to plan B

449
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,459
and you know really have to have some

450
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:15,000
leaders who are willing to go that extra

451
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,439
mile to to step out there and be leaders

452
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,660
and Pioneers in what they do because

453
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,819
what we see you know we track

454
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,519
um you know about 80 countries globally

455
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:25,918
and so whenever you see you know for a

456
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,259
region someone who really steps out one

457
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,059
jurisdiction one country you know then

458
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,220
their their Neighbors start to look

459
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:33,899
across the border and see that oh

460
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,100
actually you know they're creating a lot

461
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,660
of Revenue

462
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,599
um and they're you know maybe our

463
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,220
concerns about legalization or not

464
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,359
um you know actually unfolding it like

465
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,980
we thought

466
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,418
um you know I will say you know Luke you

467
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,620
and I were just in in Prague about a

468
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,140
month ago and we heard from the

469
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:51,239
anti-drug coordinator there you know

470
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,000
very bold statements that were being

471
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,380
made and I hope that to see more if you

472
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,960
know if things are really going to be

473
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,240
moved forward you know saying that you

474
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,980
know we're going with plan a

475
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,679
um and we're not even talking about Plan

476
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,599
B because then politicians are going to

477
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,120
latch on to plan B and try to move

478
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,500
forward with that but you know the

479
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,500
government is messaging at least that

480
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,319
they are going to you know Go full bore

481
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,819
ahead with full legalization and I think

482
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,220
that that's the kind of attitude that

483
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:22,319
that you know has has to be in place

484
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,679
that you need more than just allies but

485
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,019
you need champions for policy change

486
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,298
I think an important point to consider

487
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,679
also since Germany is now in the phase

488
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,319
where you know we're sort of at the cusp

489
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,820
year of legalization is leaving room for

490
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,200
product Innovation and and for

491
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,779
innovation of companies to come in and

492
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,120
really do a successful job and to

493
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,339
simulate as much as possible I think the

494
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,038
kinds of products or the experience that

495
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,139
people have known to love about cannabis

496
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,000
and and from the plant and I think you

497
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,380
do that by leaving room unfortunately

498
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,380
for a little bit of profitability

499
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:59,220
because ultimately the goal here is for

500
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,080
compliance and enforcement to be to be

501
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,460
active and to be executed properly for

502
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,139
companies to be compliant and produce

503
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,720
safe product that the industry is

504
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,880
regulated but also to defeat the illicit

505
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,279
market and protect Youth and to be able

506
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,039
to do that you'll need to be able to

507
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,178
have commercial companies involved in

508
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,519
this that are that are somewhat for

509
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,679
profit I mean from from a commercial

510
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,940
standpoint the recommendation I would

511
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,980
give to those who are looking to start a

512
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,019
business would be to you know think

513
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,339
globally but have a very targeted

514
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,160
approach in how you set your business

515
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:32,038
and one of the leading causes of failure

516
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,840
in the Cannabis industry was what we saw

517
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,839
in the first year of operation where

518
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,058
companies would acquire so many assets

519
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,159
and so much territory in so many square

520
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,418
meters of growing space because they

521
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,460
thought this was a competition this was

522
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:47,940
King of the Hill and that ultimately led

523
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,579
to their demise and the uprise of Kraft

524
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:54,058
cannabis products which were very low

525
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:57,000
person per plant ratios and that is now

526
00:19:54,058 --> 00:20:00,000
the highest amount of product being sold

527
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,798
in in retail dispensaries in Canada is

528
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,119
from these Craft products because

529
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,859
they're asset light and they have low

530
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,839
licensing fees so taking a very

531
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,000
staggered approach to starting a

532
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,939
business in cannabis is ultimately the

533
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,980
thing that will drive your success

534
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,860
best way to stay compliant with

535
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,599
regulations is to be proactive and

536
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,178
actually help write the laws that go

537
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,980
into regulations and the only way to do

538
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,559
that is to really band together and

539
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,798
collaborate with other businesses in

540
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,779
this space form coalitions get Lobby

541
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,679
groups these lobbyists can get you in

542
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:36,240
the door with these politicians find

543
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,460
emails phone numbers of these

544
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,480
politicians hand them out to everyone

545
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,179
your patients can call and say I don't

546
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,339
like this part of the law I want this to

547
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,900
be written in the law like they can

548
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:52,019
absolutely influence remember your

549
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:55,500
politicians are there for the people and

550
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:58,679
one lesson that I hope Europe takes a

551
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,700
lesson learned from the US is that

552
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,519
medical recreational CBD THC we need to

553
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,019
work together not against each other

554
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,359
just one more thing if I might add

555
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,339
actually two more things I'll say one is

556
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,918
you gotta remember that legalization is

557
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,119
a process it's not an event

558
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,038
especially when you're setting up

559
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,359
companies right you don't do this once

560
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,298
and it's done and that's the regulations

561
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,619
right it is going to be a process

562
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:24,660
Regulators fully understand this is a

563
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,339
new industry to regulate and it's

564
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,340
industry's job to hold them accounted

565
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:31,139
with that right so as things develop as

566
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:32,759
we're developing new cannabinoids we're

567
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,860
getting safety information on Vapes

568
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,599
whatever it might be we've got to start

569
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,759
holding Regulators feed to the fire and

570
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,918
saying you know the process needs to

571
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,900
evolve and so companies kind of look and

572
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,880
say all right legalization is done we've

573
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,259
now got a law and that's it now we're

574
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,039
going to stick to this framework it's

575
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:52,500
very much a very much a process

576
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,900
talking about a process

577
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,880
um I'd like to share a bit what we're

578
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,298
doing in in Switzerland right now which

579
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,580
I think then also leads into the model

580
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:04,619
projects in Germany and gives us the

581
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,418
chance to we don't want to speculate but

582
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,639
maybe you know give our two cents on

583
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,559
where this this could go based on

584
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,980
everything we've learned from other

585
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:16,079
industries from other jurisdictions in

586
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,019
other parts of the world

587
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,960
um what we've done in Switzerland was we

588
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:25,379
assessed what was done outside

589
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,480
um then we looked at the laws you know

590
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,940
the international treaties that have

591
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:35,220
been signed one of them in 1961 a very

592
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,259
special one which a lot of a lot of

593
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,880
things are based on that a lot of global

594
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:42,960
trade is based on the single Convention

595
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,179
of 1961 and under that it clearly states

596
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,538
you can either go you know natural

597
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:51,120
traditional medicine or you can go

598
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:54,720
research and research can be social

599
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,779
economical and social cultural or as we

600
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,940
do in Switzerland and so what we've set

601
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,399
up there we realized okay there is a gap

602
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,640
there that we can test how this Market

603
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,500
goes forward and instead of saying this

604
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,900
has worked there we do this this has

605
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,119
worked there the government came up and

606
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,519
really created I would say the most open

607
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,379
framework out there in Switzerland at

608
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,058
the moment you can go you need to be

609
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,380
part of the health Ministry or you

610
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,019
supply to the health Ministry you've got

611
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,640
to have the municipality you got to have

612
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:27,058
a cultivation manufacturing distribution

613
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,700
point of sale a study nurse which is a

614
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:33,178
qualified person police has to be

615
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,819
involved and a research institute as I

616
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,419
mentioned before and you can come up and

617
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:41,519
come forward and really share how this

618
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,780
could work and I'll give two examples

619
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,579
there

620
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:45,980
um basil is the first one that is

621
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:50,038
happening right now

622
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:53,460
372 consumers not patients have access

623
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:56,339
to regulated recreational THC cannabis

624
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,500
it is nine pharmacies that is being

625
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:01,619
distributed through y9 pharmacies

626
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,599
because it has a integrated supply chain

627
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,939
that already is you know fast and easy

628
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,939
to kind of work within compliance the

629
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,759
reporting is done under a general

630
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,980
narcotics law so so that was the

631
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,779
approach of Basel the easy one The Fast

632
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,779
One how can we do that then it was

633
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:21,359
obviously Very Fast approved Zurich went

634
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,798
with 2000 consumers at first those are

635
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,959
small numbers for you but we're a small

636
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,359
country so it's quite significant for

637
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,640
their compared to the amount of actual

638
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,158
users and there is 21 points of sale it

639
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,538
can be Social Clubs it can be and we

640
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,940
have this thing that if you you know

641
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:38,119
drop points if you're an addict for

642
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,720
heroin you get methadone government

643
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:44,639
supported and and normal dispensaries so

644
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,100
what did Switzerland do Switzerland

645
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,740
allowed

646
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:52,019
uh stakeholder driven approach to

647
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,000
understand all the different needs and

648
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:56,579
challenges that are within this industry

649
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,558
so they didn't say in Holland it's like

650
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:01,199
this and in the U.S it's like this and I

651
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,079
think what is very forward-thinking what

652
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,659
I like about that approach is that we

653
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,058
really everybody has the chance to come

654
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:11,580
up with a thesis and share why it would

655
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:14,639
work like this in their Direction so you

656
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:17,519
have I would say the first and only real

657
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,880
all stakeholder approach towards

658
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,639
how to then create a legal framework and

659
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,320
in the I think a year ago I spoke about

660
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,059
this and everybody said well the Swiss

661
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,399
you know the Swiss small country they do

662
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:33,599
what they do a couple of months ago

663
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Germany went the same way so we have a

664
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,619
lot of opportunities on the table there

665
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,140
and I just like to you know get some

666
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,519
insights from you what what would you

667
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,080
I'm not even going to ask how would you

668
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,658
put your perfect model project together

669
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,759
but now you have the chance with the

670
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:49,320
magic wand how would you set this up for

671
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,058
the future

672
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,859
I won't touch base in Switzerland really

673
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:54,359
quickly I think it's great that they've

674
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:56,639
started to move forward with the pilot

675
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:59,099
projects but unfortunately patients have

676
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,419
been left behind uh it was only until

677
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,178
last year that Switzerland actually

678
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,340
started allowing medical cannabis to

679
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,380
really meaningfully be sold it was it

680
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,538
was it had a legal program for a while

681
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,220
now but certainly not the level that

682
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:13,679
that 20 years that's that's happened

683
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,000
right so and now access is starting to

684
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,460
be available and certainly the

685
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,619
recreational Cannabis pilot projects are

686
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,480
are definitely a model way for Europe to

687
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,739
be following and it's refreshing that

688
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,900
Switzerland is actually taking that

689
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,419
approach now because I think it really

690
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,880
is in very interesting way to comply

691
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,620
with U.N treaties you mentioned U.N

692
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,480
treaties earlier and I think that's a

693
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,219
very creative compliant way to come up

694
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,079
with it and I think that's exactly what

695
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,659
we did in Canada right we basically

696
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,759
looked at un treaties we know we're

697
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,919
technically in violation of U.N treaties

698
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,720
but it's a principal non-compliant

699
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,120
approach that we decided to take in

700
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,400
Canada we had kids under the age of 18

701
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,778
that were accessing Canada us at a

702
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,000
higher rate than any other country in

703
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,319
the world and so we decided to regulate

704
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,058
it so we could start to actually have

705
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,500
conversations with you around that so I

706
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:00,839
think it's important to be making sure

707
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,339
we're taking you know care of some of

708
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,319
the foundational stuff patience I think

709
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:06,058
is one Lucas brought up the social

710
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,740
Equity piece I think that's another

711
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,960
really important one and that can be

712
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,839
built into these legislations and that

713
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,759
needs to start happening very early and

714
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,980
it also then sort of enables countries

715
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,019
to go to the U.N and have a meaningful

716
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,179
dialogue to change these treaties

717
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,038
because that's eventually what needs to

718
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,720
happen you know you're obviously going

719
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,240
to have countries like Russia and Saudi

720
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,579
Arabia that are vehemently opposed you

721
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,778
know to cannabis legalization but at

722
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:32,099
least then you start to get more and

723
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:34,079
more people on your side is when you've

724
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:35,579
had a robust system when you've factored

725
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,798
in Social Equity when you factored in

726
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:38,939
you know age of access you factor in a

727
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,519
number of conditions within the country

728
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,140
so I mean that's quite important data

729
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,400
approach like clinical trials I think if

730
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,080
we were starting from scratch it would

731
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,360
be you know let's isolate this compound

732
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,579
these compounds these cannabinoids you

733
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,899
know over 130 of them cannabis plant and

734
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:54,000
actually conduct the research because

735
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,340
regulations are based off of public

736
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,380
consultation but also the sort of the

737
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,058
political stance of of the The

738
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,039
Regulators the politicians involved in

739
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,019
creating these regulations and public

740
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:05,400
consultation is fueled from the actual

741
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,679
data that's available the scientific

742
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,059
data so having that data in hand I think

743
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,400
would create a set of regulations that

744
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:13,319
is much more fair and robust and really

745
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,080
pays attention to you know what cannabis

746
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,939
can do and what THC is really capable of

747
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,158
and I you know I'm not going to present

748
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,778
here a thesis on the on the model

749
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,100
um regulatory framework but I mean I

750
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:26,519
think uh you know whenever we're talking

751
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:28,558
about adult use or recreational use two

752
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,000
very important factors I mean well first

753
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,678
and foremost you're going to have to be

754
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,140
the illicit Market

755
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,120
um and you know two ways that I think

756
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,740
are very important one of which is being

757
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,199
done to some extent and one not so much

758
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,480
one being is accessibility I mean you've

759
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,058
got to be able to you know have a wide

760
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,798
range of products that are available

761
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,319
um because if they're not going to be

762
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,940
provided in the illicit market then uh

763
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:53,519
people folks will just go straight back

764
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,500
to the illicit Market but then also the

765
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,019
the stigma around consumption I think

766
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,700
that even in the U.S uh still you know

767
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:02,639
we are seeing some consumption lounges

768
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:05,159
I'm starting to you know take place now

769
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,100
but you know you look at like the even

770
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,080
the the German framework that's been

771
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:13,139
leaked is you know there's still this

772
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,418
stigma around uh around consumption and

773
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,100
you have to bring consumers Out of the

774
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,440
Shadows you know you even in the the

775
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,898
German framework they're saying you know

776
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,659
there would be no consumption allowed in

777
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:26,759
the clubs you know home grow you know

778
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,380
you have to keep it very you know your

779
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,058
neighbors can't even see the money from

780
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,220
children yeah

781
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:34,259
um so you know but there is still the

782
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,819
stigma around the consumption I think as

783
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:37,079
long as that stigma is still around it's

784
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,759
going to be very hard to compete with

785
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,579
the illicit Market the consumption

786
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,440
lounges also are there is no smoking

787
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:45,480
clumps anymore so there's there's again

788
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,980
there's many different aspects of feed

789
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,960
into this from different parts from

790
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,240
other industry we have them in Barcelona

791
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,980
if anyone they're all illegal and I'll

792
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,079
shout it out there every single Club in

793
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,860
Barcelona is illegal it's a gray area

794
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:01,379
that was made for another for another

795
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:04,139
issue which was heroin and consumption

796
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,960
in in the 70s and 80s so it's not a

797
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,659
legal model and yes you can smoke inside

798
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,940
there and it's nobody is you know no

799
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,820
repression on them and I think what

800
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,519
really is important is that we gotta

801
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,319
find a legal model not saying now

802
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,319
Legalize It or whatever this is this but

803
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,538
we need to find a set of rules and

804
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,918
regulation that on one hand side works

805
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:27,960
for the industry and on the other hand

806
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,880
side works for the regulator I haven't

807
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,440
heard harm reduction enough on this

808
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,480
stage is very important in Europe

809
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,940
anything that happens in opening

810
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,860
anything towards the U.N would be very

811
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,200
much the focus of harm reduction and not

812
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:43,379
creating you know just a flourishing

813
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,298
industry and and in general yes there

814
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,760
are these different models out there and

815
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:49,339
you know they're not being they're not

816
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,019
not being

817
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:55,139
chased or whatever you want to call it

818
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:58,200
but that lack of actual yeah the

819
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,299
regulatory harmonization behind which is

820
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,360
what would then in the future allow us

821
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:04,980
to kind of work together

822
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:08,879
across you know across the pond and

823
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,599
towards Asia and there's some some you

824
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,960
know standardization approaches around

825
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:18,119
that are trying to move into that and

826
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,220
think one of the big things at the

827
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:23,639
moment deepunk we quickly touched it

828
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,579
before is there are there are bodies in

829
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,520
place that regulate narcotics there's an

830
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:32,158
narcotics board from the U.N and still

831
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,859
the industry wants to kind of like do

832
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,278
their own way in their own Direction so

833
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:40,678
well open question there if we where

834
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:43,919
should we as an industry try to drive

835
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,440
this to actually realistically based on

836
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,820
best case practices from around move

837
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,679
this whole

838
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,359
or navigate through the regulatory

839
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,480
landscape to bring this industry further

840
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,740
I think the UN treaty one is is really

841
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,659
interesting and I think you brought up

842
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,819
the incb particularly which is the

843
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,220
international narcotics control board

844
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:04,740
and basically their job is to monitor

845
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,620
control activities of what would be in

846
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,200
illicit subs or a control substance

847
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,819
um and you know despite legalization in

848
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,500
Canada you still have reporting

849
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,058
requirements to the incb because they

850
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,679
want to know what's happening and Canada

851
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,240
has done a really bad job and I think

852
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,860
that's where you get into challenges

853
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,079
you've got hundreds of kilos that went

854
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:23,398
missing at the Ontario cannabis store

855
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,398
and no one could account for where they

856
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:29,639
went in a fully regulated track and tray

857
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,678
seat to sale High vaults you know dozens

858
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,840
of cameras yet you've had cannabis

859
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,278
magically gone missing

860
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,259
um I think the incb is going to start

861
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,179
looking about and going you've actually

862
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,158
done a pretty poor job on regulating

863
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:43,559
that so I think having compliance

864
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,059
systems is very important and I think

865
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:46,740
it's refreshing even on the Swiss case

866
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:48,240
to hear that Switzerland's actually

867
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,859
Outsourcing some of those abilities

868
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,899
because in Canada what the government

869
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:54,058
did was Implement an internal track and

870
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:56,038
Trace system where everyone had to

871
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:58,200
report into them and we know governments

872
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,359
do a horrible job managing I.T systems

873
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,220
generally and I think that's really been

874
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,500
a poor thing that we've seen in Canada

875
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,839
so again a takeaway that the industry

876
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,759
can say is suggest an external entity

877
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,859
that everyone can agree to a process

878
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,538
through which you'd comply with those

879
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:15,058
reporting obligations so you aren't on

880
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:16,740
side with incb right and it's going to

881
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:18,538
make your life easier because I can tell

882
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,759
you the ctls which is our cannabis

883
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,798
tracking licensing system is is a

884
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:24,298
ridiculous system to be using and

885
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,980
managing and it clearly doesn't work the

886
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:27,359
fact that you've got hundreds of kilos

887
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,940
of cannabis disappear magically

888
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,038
something's not working on a personal

889
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,720
note I'm very happy that they kept it

890
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:35,879
the way they kept it I approached them

891
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,100
in 2018 and asked them if I can bring

892
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,720
this or learn from this system bring it

893
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,000
to Europe they said no this is Canada

894
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,640
only we don't want to deal with outside

895
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,679
countries the underlying basis of it is

896
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,720
the gs1 international standards for

897
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,360
supply chain transparency which is the

898
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,000
global non-for-profit and it gave me the

899
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,939
chance to build a product on that but we

900
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,679
have three minutes 40 seconds and Gallo

901
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,538
stood up when a guy stands up that means

902
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,298
something and no no we're not done yet

903
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:06,119
we're not opening it sorry uh any any

904
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:10,199
any closing statements by all of you uh

905
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:12,659
what do you take from the panel and you

906
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:15,079
know again navigating through the

907
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,639
regulatory landscape

908
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,019
I think creating a pathway for research

909
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,639
is going to be very important for

910
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:23,039
Success not just in Germany but in any

911
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,260
other Market as well allowing the

912
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,119
partnership between either government or

913
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,399
commercial entities and non-profit

914
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,079
not-for-profits uh those like

915
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,898
universities who are conducting clinical

916
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,519
trials phase one phase two phase three

917
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:38,219
and understanding what it is this is

918
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,378
capable of these medical cannabis

919
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,939
products and allowing claims to be

920
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,440
Associated to these products so that we

921
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,820
can get that monograph that Deepak was

922
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,500
referring to for medicinal cannibal

923
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,780
medicinal cannabis products I think

924
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,398
that's really the path forward

925
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,580
for my side I think it'll really be

926
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,679
three things one don't trace shiny

927
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,299
objects wait until the regulations

928
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,059
actually develop I think what we are

929
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,460
seeing is a lot of what we saw in Canada

930
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,619
very early on is what we're seeing in 23

931
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,440
at least in certain European countries

932
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,660
particularly Germany uh and you know

933
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,159
slow down right we need to we need to

934
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:13,259
understand what the regulations are

935
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,358
actually saying I think we've really put

936
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,160
the card before the horse developing

937
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,719
business plans and figuring out what

938
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,338
products we're going to sell and really

939
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,779
there's a leaked draft that's out there

940
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:23,578
in The Ether so I think you need to walk

941
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,619
before you run and really understand

942
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,420
what the regulations are going to be the

943
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,338
second I'll say is all politics is local

944
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,260
so you know we touched on this a little

945
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:33,539
bit but I can't re-stress the importance

946
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,700
of making change locally and going to

947
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,559
your politicians and kind of really

948
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:40,019
working closely with them and the last

949
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,358
thing I'll say is you know just the

950
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:44,280
importance of uh you know working

951
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,920
collaboratively as an industry right

952
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,440
being part of European medical cannabis

953
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,358
industry associations or any any of the

954
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,760
various organizations that exist I think

955
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,739
it's it's critical for the industry to

956
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,359
have a single voice both at the national

957
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:59,338
and the international level or the

958
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,078
European level uh and I think you know

959
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:02,460
banding together and making sure that

960
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,260
you're building the industry

961
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,539
collaboratively is a responsibility of

962
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,500
the industry

963
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:11,059
foreign

964
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:14,338
I would just like to stress if you are a

965
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:17,699
manufacturer processor anything like

966
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,259
that to regulate yourself beyond what

967
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:21,838
the current regulations may be because

968
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,880
current regulations are very fluid

969
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,039
they're going to change

970
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,980
um you know so for example

971
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:31,139
start with child safe packaging even if

972
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,800
maybe that's not required in your

973
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:37,739
Providence or country or state

974
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,680
and then next I just want to kind of

975
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:43,019
repeat what Deepak said is collaborate

976
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,719
with the industry and collaborate with

977
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:47,460
your Regulators it is much better to be

978
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,838
friends with your Regulators than

979
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,679
enemies with them start that

980
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:55,739
conversation early often collaborate and

981
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:58,078
form a very strong team with other

982
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:00,539
people in the Cannabis industry

983
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,160
and yeah we talked a lot about the the

984
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:04,320
kind of Patchwork regulation I think

985
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,838
that the successful companies in in this

986
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,519
space you know have some agility

987
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:09,900
um baked into what that what they do

988
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:11,699
because there is so much regulatory

989
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,559
change and Patchwork

990
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:15,239
um so you know we try to empower our

991
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,980
clients uh doing that through things

992
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,259
like daily tracking

993
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,000
um not just you know Bill a is going

994
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,460
through this you know here's its current

995
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,619
status but tracking those discussions

996
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,000
those debates that you can narrow in on

997
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,338
you know where there is agreement where

998
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,780
there is some consensus and what may

999
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:32,519
change in the future

1000
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,079
um so that companies can be a little

1001
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,639
more agile

1002
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,500
um you know and how they operate and

1003
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,319
navigating that landscape

1004
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,139
