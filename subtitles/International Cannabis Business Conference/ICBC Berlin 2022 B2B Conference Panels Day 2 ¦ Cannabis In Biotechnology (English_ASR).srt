1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,039
so good morning everyone isn't this an

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,199
awesome event right how many of you how

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,359
many of you have only come here for the

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,919
first time hanzo

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,719
all right this is awesome we're growing

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,719
it's it's been going since 2017 and it

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,960
is only going to get better but anyway

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,320
this morning we are going to have a

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,400
great conversation about cannabis in

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
technology and i think the first

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,359
question that comes out of this is is

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,840
our panel named the right way or should

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,320
it be in reverse and why

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
go for it guys

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,640
anybody what so we uh right for

16
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,799
preparing for this conversation we think

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
it should be reversed so i don't think

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,000
it should be cannabis and biotechnology

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,319
we agree that it should be

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
uh biotechnology in cannabis

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,799
if that's okay with everybody and why do

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
you say that why why why are you all in

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,799
agreement with that

24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,198
and in the biotech world is the rules

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,519
have been formed for quite a long time

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,280
um and we came into it and we want to

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,680
change the rules towards

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,840
what we wanted to be

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,080
so i'm a medical doctor for education

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
and through algeria algae we care for 10

31
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,039
000 patients and i think at that scale

32
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,640
you look at things differently you're

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,479
looking at the research that's coming

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,478
out but you're always in you're in the

35
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,159
back of your mind thinking

36
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,438
how is this going to be applicable to

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,520
patients how is this going to be

38
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,959
available to patients and i think it's

39
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,399
interesting also

40
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,359
we did a little poll

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,759
before

42
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,759
the session and just asked

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,599
participants of the session does your

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
doctor right now

45
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,438
actually know about terpene profiles and

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,959
does he or she

47
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,639
you know use that information for

48
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,118
treatment and we saw that only a third

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,680
of the people responded hey my doctor

50
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,040
let's that influence the treatment so

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,720
just for me it's gonna deal with

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
advocate from a medical perspective i'm

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,078
always thinking about

54
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,078
okay biotechnology and we're seeing

55
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,118
crazy technologies coming out that we're

56
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,239
gonna enhance and prove the effects of

57
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,399
cannabis

58
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,158
but we're always looking at okay when

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,159
will this be applicable and let's look

60
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,640
at the data well i think that brings up

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,800
a really good point right so actually

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,519
just like the pharma pharmaceutical

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,920
discussion cannabis was banned as a

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
plant and a drug right around the time

65
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,238
that the formal pharmaceutical industry

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,959
got going in the 1930s

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
so

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,199
how do you guys think from a medical

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
perspective from an investment

70
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,079
perspective from an extraction

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,719
perspective

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,840
that this plant is going to impact the

73
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,439
biotechnology industry and or vice versa

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
i know that's a big question but you

75
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,560
know highlights

76
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,238
i think we actually have a unique

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,878
opportunity here from medical

78
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,878
perspective that through cannabis we can

79
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,239
offer more personalized treatment so we

80
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
have so many

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,680
access points basically within the plant

82
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,839
to say we're gonna do re you know kind

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,439
of cannabis dna based treatment and

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,239
that's how we look at it so we are

85
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,239
completely data driven so we can plug in

86
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
actually you know starting with terpene

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,840
profiles but also look at other

88
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,919
biomarkers within the plant and plug

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
that with outcomes of patients so i

90
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,399
think we're just getting started

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
actually

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,959
you've thought something like yeah

93
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,479
definitely

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,120
this is just the beginning from a

95
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,238
scientific perspective uh currently i

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,200
think we have a 1200 1300 studies

97
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,439
trials going on right now with cbd

98
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,719
with thc 250 300 different trials um you

99
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,479
know they're looking at multiple

100
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,560
different indications different delivery

101
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,959
methods um you know to bring that

102
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,318
medication in and that's just the

103
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
beginning now

104
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,119
um you know that's only going forward

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,599
much quicker especially uh since the u.n

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,840
voted to to prove this to be a medicine

107
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,399
and as more countries come on

108
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
that's going to open up the capital flow

109
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,760
for people to to make these larger

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,759
investments

111
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,479
into the future and looking more as a

112
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,438
biotech rather than a recreational only

113
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,518
space

114
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,438
that you've seen in other markets well i

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,480
have to say i mean as an american german

116
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,479
sitting here

117
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,639
it is very refreshing to hear that the

118
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,158
doctor on the panel talk about terpenes

119
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,798
i mean that concession even a couple of

120
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,399
years ago was almost unheard of you

121
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,920
didn't hear that so i mean i think

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,158
there's going to be other discussions

123
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,759
and i wanted to get into one of the

124
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,560
topics that we raised in agreement which

125
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,519
was

126
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,319
what about all of the delta eight and

127
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,560
the delta zeros and the delta tens that

128
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,478
you're about coming from the us

129
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,959
when is that discussion gonna start to

130
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,800
hit here and how is that going to fit

131
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,000
into a more formal

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
biotech

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,759
structure than say just the wild west of

134
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,758
recreational yesterday

135
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,519
that's the classic

136
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
answer to almost anything when you talk

137
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,120
to any company you know when do you need

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,040
money or when's this going to happen

139
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
it's always yesterday in canada's right

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
uh real quick though a couple numbers

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,959
you know there's a reason why there's an

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
investment banker on this panel

143
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,959
just a couple couple quick few numbers i

144
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
have two undergrad degrees in science

145
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,879
i worked for 15 years in biotech

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
companies and veteran on three u.s

147
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,319
patents

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,120
i worked in investment banking 17 years

149
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,959
now

150
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,319
uh we've worked in cannabis in the u.s

151
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,000
and north america for eight years we've

152
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,800
worked internationally in cannabis for

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
six

154
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,240
and then also i've been

155
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,079
for the last two years chairman of the

156
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,720
scientific advisory council for athletes

157
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,639
for care which is composed of four

158
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,440
leading scientists ethan versailles

159
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,639
guillermo moreno-san sans from spain

160
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,680
um raquel perube and deb kimlis

161
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,600
but yes

162
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,519
we've worked with a client that's uh

163
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,479
making uh we actually talked to a client

164
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,680
yesterday he's uh making hhc

165
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,519
so i don't know if you guys have heard

166
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,360
that but instead of tetrahydrocannabinol

167
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,198
it's hexahydrocannabinol

168
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600
so that's got a whole different form

169
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
factor to it and then you have acetyl

170
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
groups being added to the things and

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
then also in europe one thing to bring

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,199
up that's interesting

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,800
the united circuit court of appeals

174
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,680
about two months ago allowed and came

175
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,160
out and said that delta eight thc is

176
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
actually now legal nationally under the

177
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
farm bill

178
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,478
so

179
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,639
yeah to your question

180
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,800
where is this all going and frankly i am

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,160
you know i i don't know

182
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,240
i mean this is this is one of the big

183
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
problems right so if you have a let's

184
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,918
say a delta 8 which is also being made

185
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,840
from cbd right now in the united states

186
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,599
once you get into a much more formalized

187
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,359
environment which is europe and the

188
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,960
medical discussion

189
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,520
how do you see

190
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,719
path to market market authorizations

191
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,120
happening

192
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,840
in a situation where again it's even

193
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,399
more unusual than the drug cannabis or

194
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,799
do you see as this becomes more accepted

195
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,279
within the biotech and pharmaceutical

196
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,879
community that will flip any thoughts on

197
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,559
this

198
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,079
i mean it's an interesting perspective

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,439
when you you have like the u.s

200
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,159
perspective

201
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,839
you juxtapose that to the uh the way

202
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,720
europe is looking at it

203
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,560
i'm sure the us and producers you know

204
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,280
what they're pushing the limits

205
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,959
um and you know the politicians

206
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,318
you know are either embarrassed to

207
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,560
address the issue

208
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,319
or some of the stakes are addressing the

209
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,839
issue and combining these new uh uh

210
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,319
semi-synthetics um you know either under

211
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,679
cannabis or allowing them to uh to

212
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
proliferate

213
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,400
um

214
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,879
you know but

215
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,279
you're very limited uh from the european

216
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,918
perspective um you know these kind of

217
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,879
advances would require in my mind at

218
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,478
least uh clinical trials and more data

219
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,399
in order you know to bring these to

220
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,800
market or bring these to fruition and at

221
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,560
this point uh you know uh you know we

222
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
for sure are gonna be making for our

223
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,000
indeed purposes semi-synthetics um but

224
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,719
the usage is is not yet clear uh in the

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,959
market and even the terpenes uh you know

226
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,080
we're we're registering those as

227
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,560
excipients uh flavor you know flavor um

228
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,800
you know we're not making claims as to

229
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
what their positive or negative effects

230
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
may be

231
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,240
um so you know it's fun to watch it from

232
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,439
the u.s perspective they're

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,199
way out there you know on these products

234
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,199
and in a good way i don't mean it

235
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,960
negatively but you know we also have to

236
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
find out what is the exact science

237
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,959
behind it to make this a reality for

238
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,519
europe in my mind

239
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,918
well my that's my next question is the

240
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,839
biotech discussion really only limited

241
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,279
to the medical discussion or is it a

242
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,359
broader

243
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,959
spectrum of discussion and it would be

244
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,080
interesting actually from to hear from

245
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,318
me from europe okay you know us being

246
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,359
advanced let's say somewhere between six

247
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,879
to 20 years i guess some ballpark number

248
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,038
but what does it actually mean within

249
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,800
the country so all the new research all

250
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,199
the new applications all the biotech

251
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,879
innovations in the us are they being

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,240
applied in the u.s or is it still kind

253
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,719
of you know lab benchmark

254
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,719
but you guys

255
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,399
that's a good question

256
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,919
i think one thing that's interesting

257
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
that we've been trying to do and i think

258
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,399
everybody in this audience would agree

259
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
that

260
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,000
everybody knows somebody that's used

261
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
some kind of preparation and it's really

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,278
helped them out so there's a lot that's

263
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,039
the problem is there's all this

264
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,958
anecdotal data there's no doubt this

265
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,639
plan works i think the one thing that

266
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,119
we're trying to do we've always tried to

267
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,360
work with companies and provide capital

268
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,799
so they can do the right experiments to

269
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
get the right data whether it's in a

270
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,799
clinical trial or something less

271
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,359
i think everybody would agree our

272
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,240
perspective is the entourage effect is

273
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,919
real

274
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
but i think in order to really get the

275
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,759
value out of this plant we need to do

276
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,759
another molecule by molecule basis and

277
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,240
kind of deconstruct you know there's

278
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,480
over i think 600 compounds in cannabis

279
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,839
sativa so i think that's one thing that

280
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,360
i think everybody in this room and

281
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,360
probably everybody on the panel would be

282
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,278
agree we need to do the work whether

283
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,039
it's under stringent conditions or even

284
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,679
maybe less changing conditions to find

285
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,000
out really what is the value of this of

286
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,000
this plan and on a molecular basis well

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,080
when you get into delivery issues and

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,399
delivery discussions and the technology

289
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,879
that goes along with that i think that

290
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,958
that's also going to have a much more

291
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,480
i guess a greater impact on this

292
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,559
discussion but here's i'm going to flip

293
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,200
this back to you do you think that in

294
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,639
europe there's going to be more of a

295
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,278
focus on this discussion from the

296
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,519
biotechnology discussion first on the

297
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,519
recreational side and i'm going to throw

298
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,200
that out there in part because for those

299
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,919
of you who are not german or don't live

300
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,079
here the vast majority of medications in

301
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,078
this system are generic i mean most

302
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,919
germans are used to going to a doctor

303
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,519
getting a prescription going to the

304
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,439
output or the pharmacy and getting it

305
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,759
for 10 years because the government is

306
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
allowed to pre-negotiate contracts

307
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,120
is that kind of discussion going to have

308
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
an impact on this

309
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
plant and the legalization of it so far

310
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
and do you see like the united states

311
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,278
perhaps

312
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
more of a discussion of the

313
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,439
biotechnology happening in the

314
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,879
recreational side first because of the

315
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,120
regulatory structure here and the

316
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,879
difficulties of getting a mainstream

317
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,480
drug into the system

318
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,000
like nano for example or patches or

319
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
i think that depends a little bit on how

320
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
it all plays out so what they're ready

321
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,359
to reframe before legalization

322
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,399
recreation space will really

323
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,399
look like

324
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,039
um again i think we're in a unique

325
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,879
situation where we have had five years

326
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,958
of a medical market in germany which was

327
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,320
a very advanced law um especially in the

328
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,559
european space

329
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,640
and when looking at also the pay phone

330
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,439
we found results like a

331
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,879
supervisory study the results are not

332
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,200
great there so i think from a

333
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,799
politician's standpoint uh with all the

334
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
different lobbyists involved there

335
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,319
you're gonna look at data you're gonna

336
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,079
look at hard fact data which sounds a

337
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
little bit boring but

338
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,719
we have again also looking at new types

339
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,879
of applications and new types of you

340
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,480
know biotechnology innovations

341
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,838
we can apply that already now in a

342
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,278
medical space

343
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,279
you know have

344
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,838
have regulated results have results of

345
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,480
ricky ryland then applied over in a

346
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,480
recreational space

347
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480
you're an extractor so so i'm going to

348
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,399
throw this back for a second

349
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
um

350
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,839
how do i say this

351
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,120
i think that the biotechnology

352
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,320
perspective for me is at this point is

353
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
like how do you separate the

354
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,839
cannabinoids out how do you make them

355
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,199
effective and how you bring them to

356
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,440
market beyond the technology itself but

357
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
here's my question to you is in the

358
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,079
united states right now i mean there's

359
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,399
probably better people out there to talk

360
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,039
about this but for example delta 8 seems

361
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,200
to me to be still a narcotic even though

362
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,599
it's coming from cbd so just because

363
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,680
you're submitting it to a process

364
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
chemical process or whatever does that

365
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,399
fundamentally change the nature of the

366
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
cannabinoid

367
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,799
i mean there's a lot to unpack there

368
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,719
you know from one point we're

369
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,559
manufacturers you know we're not

370
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,600
necessarily confined to the beginning

371
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,399
stage

372
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,399
of extraction so we're looking to bring

373
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,639
uh finished products to the market and

374
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
bring authorizations uh to the market

375
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,879
and germany is a little bit different in

376
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,600
that respect uh you know they've kind of

377
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,838
made their own rules you know to to

378
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,720
circumvent you know the herbal medicine

379
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
rules

380
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,278
and

381
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
that's quite complicated you know

382
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,519
they're they're they're stuck to a

383
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,399
singular molecule dronabinol

384
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,200
um you know and they're looking at

385
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,039
compounding the magisterial prep um you

386
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
know and this is fine

387
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,439
you know for advancing um you know at

388
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,839
least the beginning stages of the

389
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,399
advancement but when you look at market

390
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,320
authorizations for herbal medicines um

391
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,278
this is these rules have been set well

392
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,680
before cannabis got into play uh in

393
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,240
europe and you have to

394
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,078
think in those terms when you're making

395
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,399
whatever medicines you're making and

396
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:36,239
you're confined to singular elements

397
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,320
a thc distillate cbd distillate thca

398
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
and these ones like cdn which you're

399
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,560
seeing popping up in switzerland

400
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,638
and the uk and

401
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,439
these don't exist in the monographs you

402
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,560
know currently so you know there's a lot

403
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
of there's

404
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,239
there's a nice building blocks in the

405
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,320
beginning uh you know for us to develop

406
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,639
medicines and there's a clear pathway

407
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,519
with some countries uh to get these

408
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,278
authorizations and as other countries

409
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,120
kind of you know develop their rules and

410
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,120
even if germany let's say goes

411
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,278
recreational what does that mean

412
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,600
maybe that'll be a flourishing flower

413
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,439
market and at the end you know the

414
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,839
doctors will be looking for innovative

415
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,320
products um you know more along the

416
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,760
extractable basis would be my guess i

417
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,399
mean who knows

418
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,360
so i'd like to go back to your question

419
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,799
i think margaret you had on on wreck or

420
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,159
don't use whatever you want to call it

421
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,759
biotech

422
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,278
so one thing i think that's interesting

423
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,278
for people to note is so uh back in 2013

424
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,958
2014 i was chief business officer of

425
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,240
serna which is one of the first public

426
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,838
companies

427
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,919
in the space there's a company at the

428
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,399
same time called ebu

429
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,479
heavy was in colorado and they had these

430
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
four or five formulations that you know

431
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
this is going to make you calm this is

432
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,079
going to make you creative

433
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
so i was lucky enough to work at a

434
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,838
company called a few metrics in late 90s

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,720
leading generics company and they

436
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
essentially came up with the term

437
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,560
pharmacogenomics because of their

438
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,399
technology

439
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,399
and that's one thing you guys ought to

440
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
note is that even on the wreck side one

441
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,198
thing we need to do more of is the human

442
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,799
genetic side so if my wife even takes a

443
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,519
small preparation of any kind of

444
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,000
cannabinoid she's gonna she goes off the

445
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,440
off the rails right so that's one thing

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
even on the rec side that we can do

447
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
better on

448
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,800
characterizing the human genetic side

449
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,199
the snips the biomarkers because

450
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,958
everybody most people will

451
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,120
will react differently to these

452
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,198
preparations and also for medicare so

453
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,959
that's actually my question in return

454
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,879
maybe looking at

455
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,399
both personalized treatment but also

456
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,720
personalized consumption maybe in a

457
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,039
recreational space again i think there's

458
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,480
opportunity maybe looking at dna looking

459
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,360
at other biomarkers

460
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,199
to

461
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
create products that kind of plug in

462
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,599
there so from a from a creation from an

463
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,320
extraction standpoint are you looking at

464
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
what type of data would we need from

465
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,560
customers patients

466
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,919
to then formulate something but still be

467
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,599
able to scale or how are you looking at

468
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,159
the market

469
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,278
okay so so we had this conversation back

470
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,679
in the green room as well is this plant

471
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,838
fundamentally different to begin with

472
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,120
and say

473
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,880
poppies why is cannabis so different

474
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,639
from that and what is that

475
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,078
going to have what impact is that going

476
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,079
to have on this discussion as well

477
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,198
well

478
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,278
one thought and i don't know a whole lot

479
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,758
about heroin and poppies but my guess is

480
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,799
that you know really they do try to

481
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,680
concentrate down heroin to the point of

482
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,399
uh you know that's the only active agent

483
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,399
but mentioned before there's over 600

484
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,399
it could be 600 active agents i mean

485
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,078
that gets back to the point of you know

486
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,919
are all these cannabinoids and terpenes

487
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:44,159
have some value to some indication or

488
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,399
i mean my guess is suddenly have no

489
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,319
value at all but then maybe do they have

490
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,839
value in combination so i think that's

491
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
one thing getting back to the entourage

492
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,079
effect that that's the magic uh i think

493
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,440
of cannabis

494
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,439
um are there any questions from the

495
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,320
audience at this point

496
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,320
there's one over there

497
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,919
well we already

498
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,038
[Music]

499
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,799
there are a lot of experts in the

500
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,640
audience also so there are a couple of

501
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,480
questions right we're all experts in

502
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,000
this audience let's hear it again for

503
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,588
margaritaville

504
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,588
[Applause]

505
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,199
i would like to know your opinions about

506
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,480
synthetic

507
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
well there are a number of ways using

508
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,558
biotechnology to produce cannabinoids

509
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
one is through um

510
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:42,079
synthetic chemistry some is by

511
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:45,038
biosynthesis using hosts like algae or

512
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,678
yeast or bacteria and then there's the

513
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,960
system that we use which is growing stem

514
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,360
cells of cannabis um it doesn't produce

515
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,079
the whole entourage effect it produces

516
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,319
specifically a group of cannabinoids but

517
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,558
this is the biotech for the production

518
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,480
of cannabis how is that going

519
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,440
how are these systems going to impact

520
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,400
the

521
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,640
regulations in the market

522
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
i think just medically speaking

523
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,880
as a doctor you're pretty much open to

524
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,519
every type of application that you know

525
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,799
is safe in a patient's hands

526
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,798
so i think

527
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,599
a little bit boring but also down to the

528
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,240
point depends on the data depends on the

529
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,678
results that you get of it i think what

530
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,599
it's interesting at these panels also we

531
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,038
were looking at maybe two to three

532
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,839
hundred thousand cannabis patients in

533
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,640
germany which is still tiny i mean still

534
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,240
by a tenfold at least so many more

535
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,720
patients in germany could benefit from

536
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,279
cannabis which also means it needs to be

537
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,798
more standard and it also means types of

538
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,480
needs to be more centered so i think

539
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,200
synthetics as also margaret said when it

540
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,960
comes to regular medication germany is

541
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,720
one of the ways to go

542
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,400
and also i mean this has been a war

543
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,839
waging for a long time hundreds of

544
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,880
millions have gone into biosynthesis

545
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,480
you know

546
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
you know they're trying to get

547
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,038
to a more economical format

548
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
you know clearly this is this is very

549
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,000
attractive

550
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
from the biotech industry especially

551
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,880
places like usa where the fda is more

552
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,839
guided on a synthetic basis as opposed

553
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,200
to an herbal medicine basis um you know

554
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,199
and you have to keep a global

555
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,640
perspective um you know you have a lot

556
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,798
of countries that are going to be coming

557
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559
on that have more herbal medicine

558
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,720
you know results like india as an

559
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,839
example and and europe they're more

560
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,519
accepting

561
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,000
but you know clearly all of them have a

562
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,400
space and if you can reproduce at an

563
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,440
economical rate through biosynthesis

564
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,840
semi synthesis you know biocatalysis

565
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,640
whatever your process is

566
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,319
you know there's a market for it

567
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,400
one quick thing to add to that michael

568
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,240
is i think the interesting thing is we

569
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
have so many indications potential

570
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,919
indications that could be solved and you

571
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,320
have so many of these

572
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,400
these molecules in this plant that

573
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,038
matrix that you combine to try to find

574
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,600
combinations thereof it's to deconvolute

575
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,679
that it's it's going to be a big uh

576
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,119
issue but one last thing on the we don't

577
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,759
like to call it synthetics we like to

578
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,839
call it alternative production methods

579
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,919
but you know what we believe is we have

580
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,720
no idea if it's going to be used e coli

581
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
chemistry or some combination of fido

582
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
and whatever

583
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
but one thing we do believe is the way

584
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,599
to do it the cheapest with the highest

585
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
quality cannabinoids is probably going

586
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,079
to win over can i say i mean i think how

587
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,558
it's produced is one issue and also then

588
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,319
how it's absorbed by the human body if

589
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,839
you think about for example a technology

590
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,519
like nano

591
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,199
and if you know there's a synthetic

592
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,000
versus natural discussion there as well

593
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
that's getting into some very other

594
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
long and involved questions do you have

595
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,639
another comment to make or

596
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,720
i have just a question uh my name is

597
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,519
amig i'm impressed from falling and

598
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
representing also the medical cannabis

599
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,960
division of

600
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,720
the association the german one i think

601
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
what you're addressing is i think these

602
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,798
purely pharmaceutical development

603
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,200
questions starting from the extract

604
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,079
that's the biotechnology part

605
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,558
with the very clear guidelines on how to

606
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,759
to be to get a product or an active

607
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,839
actually approved by the authorities

608
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,759
and if you talk about the terpene

609
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,000
characterization do you really see the

610
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,879
chance that this can be characterized so

611
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,319
that it does fulfill the guidelines and

612
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,039
that that can

613
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,279
will allow an approval of

614
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,599
this kind of an active material

615
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,240
and also you're addressing uh delivery

616
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,480
systems nanos or whatever which is again

617
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,640
purely pharmaceutical questions

618
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,038
and i'm i still feel that the

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,520
pharmaceutical industry this audience is

620
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,679
a bit underrepresented and maybe my

621
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,720
question now to you is how do you rate

622
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,919
the complexity in terms of timing and in

623
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,000
terms of players in that area so that at

624
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,080
the end there will be a product that me

625
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,079
that does meet the market

626
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,079
both with full characterization of the

627
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,839
terpene levels and the actives but also

628
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,439
with delivery systems

629
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,798
from your background now and for your

630
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,798
experience from the u.s market

631
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,919
one thing i'd add to that

632
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,798
with regards whether it's the ema ema

633
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,240
here in europe or it's the fda

634
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,119
you know also i'm since i'm an

635
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,480
investment banker we deal with the sec i

636
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,000
think everybody in this audience would

637
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,360
agree the regulators are always behind

638
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,480
the curve whether it's crypto or

639
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,319
cannabis

640
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,919
and a matter of fact somebody wants to

641
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,839
talk to me later we've heard some recent

642
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,520
stuff from the fda i think that's one

643
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,079
question getting back to your

644
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,839
thought on the pharma side is the

645
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,199
regulators one question we need to

646
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,399
figure out is how to do this better

647
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,919
because the regulators are probably

648
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,360
going to screw it up

649
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,640
they're already screwing it up the fda

650
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,199
should have done a lot more than they've

651
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,720
already done in the u.s and the ema

652
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,080
supposedly you know they're sitting on

653
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,200
their hands too so i don't know if that

654
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,639
really answered your question but i

655
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,480
think that's yeah i think that that

656
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,880
describes the current situation because

657
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,360
regulators are really they they

658
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,679
you can build into this as much as you

659
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,918
want on complexity on the other hand

660
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,840
that would limit finally an improved

661
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,919
product but how do you rate it and how

662
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,918
do you see it maybe different in the u.s

663
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,558
go ahead

664
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,038
yeah

665
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,759
from the u.s perspective you know you

666
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,599
have to realize that you know from a

667
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:15,279
recreational point we can make a product

668
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,319
tomorrow put it right on the shelf and

669
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,119

eye to all of this and you know they're

691
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,640
another time but then you have you know

692
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,038
countries like portugal which are

693
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,038
adopting the herbal rules um you know

694
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,000
which is a path to the acm which is a

695
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,599
path into the european market but these

696
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,519
you know germany would you know thumb

697

you know i mean you know you have to

703
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,119
look at from a country to country basis

704
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,880
and how they're developing these rules

705
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,558
and are these federal regulators

706
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,720
overworked it do they want to deal with

707
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,399
this and they surely don't want to deal

708
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,000
with thousands of cannabis people

709
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,640
