1
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,379
what happens when a movement becomes an

2
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,359
industry

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,519
most importantly what happens when that

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,460
industry happens

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,939
in a fragmented way globally

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,219
and there's no uniformity how do people

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,198
create Commerce

8
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,118
well that's what most people in this

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,539
room and most people in this industry

10
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,539
are figuring out on a regular basis and

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,820
that's the exciting thing that I get to

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,339
talk about here so

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,780
as I mentioned I'm a lawyer most people

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,480
don't want to hear from a lawyer unless

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,120
you have to but I'm here to try to give

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,398
you some context

17
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:51,140
why does an american-based lawyer matter

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,140
in Berlin Germany

19
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,919
I've seen a lot in 13 years in this

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,539
industry and I can tell you and what

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,859
you're going to hear next from Bo

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,679
Whitney

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,539
is that there are repeatable patterns

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,938
there are demonstrable Trends those

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:10,500
patterns happen over and over again all

26
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,859
around the world

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,640
they do the exact same pattern

28
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:20,340
what changes is the timeline of these

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,460
those changes coming into play

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,700
that timeline is often dictated by the

31
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,039
population of the jurisdiction

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,500
so it's that patterns those patterns

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
have timelines that I'm trying to talk

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,978
about this afternoon if you have a

35
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,959
question please raise your hand if I can

36
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,759
work it in I will I want to make sure

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,459
that this is as informative as possible

38
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,259
at least Clark kills Global cannabis

39
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,379
division a couple of my partners are

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,599
here with me Sanders exevski from Los

41
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,839
Angeles he takes companies public he's

42
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,959
an SCC lawyer right now those companies

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,820
here that are operating lawfully in

44
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,399
whatever jurisdiction you're in

45
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,859
there's access to public markets to

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,899
Capital markets in the U.S today you

47
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,200
don't have to wait

48
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,479
secondly with my partner Sam out of our

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,459
Dublin office and I'd encourage you to

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,959
take a close look at your operating

51
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,719
globally

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,959
and incorporating your company

53
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,340
registering it in Ireland

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,039
there's a number of reasons for that

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,840
that I won't get into but if you couple

56
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,598
those two things together

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,719
you're situated properly you have low

58
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,359
taxation rates you have protection

59
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,519
from insolvency which you don't get in

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,260
the United States

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,319
and more importantly you have access to

62
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,419
Capital or more access to Capital than

63
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,018
most companies in the space but when I

64
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:48,659
talk about the global supply chain

65
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,780
why does that matter for you folks

66
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,818
working so hard here in Germany to get a

67
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,060
license

68
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:59,818
to get a store to hire people that are

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,920
competent and qualified

70
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,679
how do you do that why does this matter

71
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,859
to you well here's why it matters

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,040
because this is a global industry you

73
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,580
don't see it today but the supply chain

74
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,699
is global you don't see it on a mass

75
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,099
scale but you will

76
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:24,000
commoditization is coming it's not here

77
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:25,798
yet it's not really that close yet

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
you know what commoditization is what's

79
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,219
a commodity

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,700
what's a commodity

81
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:36,000
commodity is something that occurs

82
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:38,818
when you buy or trade it before it

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,580
exists before that seed goes in the

84
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,119
ground it's sold that hasn't happened in

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,060
cannabis yet it's not likely to happen

86
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,739
even in a specific geographic location

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,519
why

88
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,799
because the supply chain needs to sort

89
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
itself out it needs to course correct

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,340
multiple times

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,500
so let's talk about some of those

92
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,500
changes that form the backdrop

93
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:07,019
the UN convention on narcotic drugs

94
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:09,419
raise your hand if you've heard of the

95
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,599
U.N convention on the kind of drugs it's

96
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:15,899
certainly a place that we need to start

97
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,539
in November of 2020

98
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,879
the U.N convention the committee on

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,340
narcotic drugs recommended changes they

100
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,259
recommended the recognition of medicinal

101
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,299
cannabis

102
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,160
as something new to be treated

103
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,900
separately and differently from the

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,820
prohibition of cannabis

105
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,698
number two

106
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:38,699
they recognize that cannabinoids from

107
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,680
Industrial Hemp or industrial usage such

108
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:45,060
as CBD

109
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,959
are not subject to U.N controls

110
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,660
but yet we have not had any mechanisms

111
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,819
no distribution of these Concepts

112
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,860
to the member nations because it's

113
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,180
challenging it's time consuming it's

114
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,060
complicated

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,280
so that forms the backdrop for what is

116
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,500
going to happen however

117
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,839
we are not waiting for the United

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,839
Nations when I say we I mean operators

119
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,060
within the industry our clients no one's

120
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,819
waiting for the United Nations in fact

121
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,259
look at a country like Uruguay our

122
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,538
friends more acquire out on the floor

123
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,460
one of the first the first country in

124
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:22,978
the world to outright legalize cannabis

125
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:26,180
now it's a small country four million

126
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:26,180
people plus or minus

127
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,619
but it has a big impact

128
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,839
because they're participating as one of

129
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,600
the first Nations along with Canada now

130
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,519
Colombia Israel

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,379
for the exploitation of catalysts the

132
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,779
Netherlands so forth and so on but

133
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,639
they're small trade why is there small

134
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,879
trade right now

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,620
because the Distribution Systems are not

136
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,918
built

137
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,620
for commoditization they're built for a

138
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,500
tightly knit

139
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:02,879
closed loop system where every single

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:06,060
gram is tracked very strictly why

141
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,579
because there's a stigma to cannabis

142
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,740
have you heard about this stigma

143
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,800
Stoner mentality

144
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,240
Etc that exists and that what is what we

145
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,418
have to deal with

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,199
moving slowly giving policy makers

147
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:24,299
elected officials comfort that operators

148
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,340
in the industry are actually doing

149
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,500
things the right way they're doing

150
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,239
things in a way that's strictly

151
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,918
compliant

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,819
in turn

153
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,579
that makes people regular people mothers

154
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,919
fathers

155
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:43,918
okay if not accepting

156
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,439
of the Cannabis industry

157
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,719
so the U.N convention has allowed to

158
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,899
a lot but countries are not waiting for

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,060
the U.N convention to be modified

160
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,060
look at what's Happening Here do you

161
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,160
simply opt out do you wave it or you

162
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,379
make an argument

163
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,419
that we need to

164
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,538
go against the tenants of the um

165
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:09,659
convention regarding cannabis

166
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:12,719
for purposes of Public Health

167
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,880
and Public Safety National Security

168
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,800
that's what Uruguay looked at looked at

169
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,899
it very closely and we've seen very

170
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,240
little repercussions for that so it's

171
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:24,779
happening quickly but the U.N convention

172
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,038
is an impediment it's a blocker to the

173
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,038
establishment of a code

174
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,639
cannabis supply chain

175
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,460
now

176
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,639
in the U.S we may gain major distinction

177
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,500
between hemp and marijuana that

178
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,960
distinction in the U.S is point three

179
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,300
percent THC of course THC the

180
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,899
psychoactive compound

181
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,418
it's relevant but a lot less relevant

182
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:54,598
that distinction in most countries

183
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:57,839
around the world and I would suggest to

184
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,240
you here today that you don't really

185
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,939
need marijuana

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,460
for the global supply chain

187
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:08,219
you really just need cannons

188
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,439
hemp is cannabis too

189
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,660
you can grow hemp

190
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,459
for six hundred dollars per acre in the

191
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,160
U.S

192
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:20,579
you can grow a thousand acres

193
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,560
you can capture a thousand acres and 10

194
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:25,918
metric tons per acre

195
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,379
at point three percent THC

196
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,740
there's plenty of THC you can convert

197
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,200
the other compounds to THC

198
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,959
you can isolate those compounds in a

199
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,979
formulation and a process that is in

200
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,399
fact

201
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,919
a pharmaceutical ingredient standard

202
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,778
right

203
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,199
but that's a different industry than

204
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:51,659
what we're talking about mostly today

205
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,040
that's the evolution of the global

206
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,600
cannabis

207
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,139
supply chain

208
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,180
shipping cannabinoids compounds and

209
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:03,059
formulations

210
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:05,879
formulations being the key around the

211
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:08,579
world for a variety of purposes do those

212
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,338
formulations make their way into a

213
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,620
dispensary in Los Angeles California

214
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,440
do they make their way into a pharmacy

215
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,539
in Montego Oregon

216
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,740
do they make their way into a dispensary

217
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:25,500
that's adult use in Berlin Germany

218
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,299
it's a different industry and it's those

219
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,639
segments of the industry that I would

220
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,778
urge you to challenge yourself

221
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:37,220
just because you have a supply chain

222
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:40,458
because you have production extraction

223
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,639
manufacturing packaging and resale

224
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:48,059
retail capabilities does not mean you're

225
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,338
participating in the same industry that

226
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,539
exists for every person that invests in

227
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,440
the industry

228
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:59,579
there are different sectors and segments

229
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,940
now the THC percentage is important

230
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,399
because if I want to buy a flower I want

231
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,160
the THC percentage High

232
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,220
I want the oil extracted from that that

233
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:14,759
distally I want that THC percentage high

234
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,160
but is that the same ingredient is it

235
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,299
the same standard if I'm going to create

236
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,879
a formulation that's designed to treat

237
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:25,319
pure address a specific condition in the

238
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,320
human body

239
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,899
they're different I don't think they

240
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
cross in the future so please understand

241
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,220
that that there are different segments

242
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
in the industry I'll talk about that

243
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,899
from a policy perspective

244
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,958
look at this this map look at the

245
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,240
turquoise color the bluish color that

246
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,159
represents regions of the world and it's

247
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,259
not complete there are some new regions

248
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,458
of the world that need to be added on

249
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,319
there

250
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,958
but look at that man who'd have thought

251
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,339
about this I've been working

252
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:59,099
specifically in this industry only in

253
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,220
this industry for 13 years now

254
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,040
13 years of commercial practice working

255
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,399
on transactions regulations

256
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:11,338
Etc this map gets Bluer every single

257
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,578
year so congratulations to all of us and

258
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:17,100
the policy makers that make it happen

259
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:20,278
so let's look at some of the pieces here

260
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,278
of course what happens in Germany is

261
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:26,039
spread across Europe in many ways that

262
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,620
tends to be the pattern for other policy

263
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,419
developments particularly controversial

264
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,720
policy developments when the German

265
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:36,899
government takes it on regulates it does

266
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,360
it well it will take hold in many

267
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,159
locations around the globe there was a

268
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,220
meeting recently

269
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:47,039
and that was in Luxembourg with German

270
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,680
and several other nearby Nations where

271
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,078
they talked specifically about the

272
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,638
tenants for the program with Malta

273
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,319
involved Malta being the first European

274
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,419
Countryman of course to legalize

275
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,278
cannabis but it's a small small country

276
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,199
actually I think Luxembourg was first

277
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,700
but not for a commercial dispensation

278
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,620
scheme my whole point is there's

279
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,100
movement happening with small but

280
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,179
powerful and important countries

281
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,820
understanding how these countries fit

282
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,979
together

283
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,180
but Mr Holman I'm just trying to open a

284
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,820
dispensary

285
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,838
in Berlin Germany why does this matter

286
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,160
to me

287
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:25,260
it matters to you because it will be

288
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,000
allowed to be traded commercially many

289
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,919
countries around the world develop the

290
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,059
program particularly the Latin American

291
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,299
countries

292
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:35,518
that program allows for exportation only

293
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,699
there's an imbalance from the very

294
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,700
beginning

295
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:44,159
if you don't have exportation balance

296
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,379
with domestic use it's not much of an

297
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,139
economy we're seeing the Latin American

298
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,778
nations change their laws change their

299
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,539
policies in real time very rapidly to

300
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,458
address that fact

301
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,439
but that's what has to happen when you

302
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,578
look at European countries we are

303
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,740
imported

304
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,799
into just about every country with some

305
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,200
new exceptions in Germany and Beyond

306
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,359
that's not necessarily sustainable so

307
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,420
where does the Cannabis come from if

308
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,919
there's new cultivation coming online

309
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,199
and

310
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,899
let's face it does it make sense to ship

311
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,839
cannabis no matter how high quality it

312
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:25,320
is does it make sense to ship it

313
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,779
from Colombia for example all the way

314
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,639
to the European Union to Europe

315
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,559
I don't think the cost of transportation

316
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,480
and the cost of production would support

317
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,119
that in the long term particularly when

318
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,459
you have multiple African nations

319
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,620
producing cannabis for exportation and

320
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:43,078
domestic Supply pardon me International

321
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,419
Supply so those are some of the things

322
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,000
that we're seeing

323
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:51,120
in the Western Hemisphere I believe that

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,039
this will be its own supply chain when

325
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,980
you look at the United States as the

326
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,838
outlier where we have the Holy Grail so

327
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,360
to speak of consumers but those

328
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,639
consumers are limited to the states and

329
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,379
limited by the fact that they operate on

330
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,659
the marijuana side in the face of

331
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,958
federal illegality

332
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:12,360
yet our neighbors to the north and by

333
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,638
Supreme Court mandate our neighbors to

334
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,980
the south of Mexico and multiple

335
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,079
countries across the entire region have

336
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,720
an exportation policy which they'll soon

337
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,599
balance with a domestic policy

338
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,000
this is its own supply chain

339
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,339
it doesn't seem that way today

340
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,820
but it will be it's important to

341
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:35,639
understand that understand the economics

342
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,839
in the Western Hemisphere

343
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,500
so

344
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,880
when you import or export the questions

345
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,539
becomes and I think somebody asked a

346
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,458
question on the wolva app don't we need

347
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:51,778
standardization globally don't we need

348
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:54,059
important and Export uniformity

349
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:55,939
if you want your prices to go down the

350
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,578
answer is yes

351
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:03,800
uniformity and consistency does what

352
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,799
it allows more people to participate

353
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:09,239
if you allow more people to participate

354
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:13,078
what happens with the law of supply and

355
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,659
demand what cannabis is produced if more

356
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,778
cannabis pins produced and the standards

357
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:21,419
are easy to understand and navigate

358
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,278
is your price point higher

359
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,879
or is it low

360
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:29,220
typically it's going to be lower

361
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:32,458
substantially lower so not having

362
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,360
uniformity globally supply chain

363
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:37,319
perspective is actually not an adverse

364
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,600
condition

365
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,579
it's an asset if you can figure it out

366
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,159
and there are people there's many people

367
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:46,799
at this conference and in this room that

368
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,419
know how to navigate that complex Global

369
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,479
Marketplace

370
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,639
to navigate the lack of uniformity

371
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,920
and that's an important piece

372
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,940
when you have distinctions between hemp

373
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:02,639
and cannabis CBD and THC CBD we're

374
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,680
seeing the the marketplace explode for

375
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,259
the last 24 plus months here in Europe

376
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,819
we see the products particularly in line

377
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,100
of the novel Foods rolling in some of

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,139
the inconsistencies there but does it

379
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,420
really only matter that I'm producing

380
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,919
something from a cannabis plant and the

381
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,919
country or the jurisdiction in which

382
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:23,219
that plant was produced

383
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,919
allows it licenses it and and

384
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,079
facilitates the exportation

385
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,539
and the recipient country

386
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,399
you need to have the same thing they

387
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,379
need to be able to possess material that

388
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,078
meets their standard they need to be

389
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:40,919
able to import it into the hands of a

390
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:42,419
licensed producer or participant and

391
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:44,099
they need to have a structure behind it

392
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,399
for the dispensation of that material

393
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,860
those things exist mostly

394
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,839
and there's a part to navigating it

395
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,079
right now that if you can navigate it

396
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,660
now now is the time to go out and build

397
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:00,299
that infrastructure as the price points

398
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:03,000
will be much higher

399
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:06,000
we look at the limited movement of

400
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,119
infused cannabinoid products

401
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,240
oil moves right we see oil move around

402
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:16,078
the world we see flowers move around the

403
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:20,160
world both hemp and marijuana flowers

404
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,678
but what we don't necessarily say

405
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,579
s are cannabinoid finished products

406
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,340
because in jurisdiction by jurisdiction

407
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,319
the types of ways to consume cannabis

408
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:34,319
it's regulated different

409
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,178
it's regulated so differently that you

410
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,159
can't import an edible in most

411
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,960
jurisdictions but maybe you can import

412
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,538
the oil and produce the edible in that

413
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,940
jurisdiction or the consumable

414
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:47,700
so the regulations are your friends not

415
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,919
your fault understanding that

416
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,720
understanding that intellectual property

417
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,299
matters

418
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,259
the brands matter in cannabis today what

419
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,259
do you think yes or no

420
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,340
Brand's math but it depends where

421
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,200
we saw the Willie Nelson

422
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:08,699
Snoop Dogg Brands come out in the United

423
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,100
States

424
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,620
there's not a lot of loyal following for

425
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:17,038
those products

426
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:20,399
we see brands that people buy brands or

427
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,679
they simply buy consistency

428
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,780
isn't that brand new

429
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,000
Snoop Dogg product doesn't sell but the

430
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,558
consistent product cells

431
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,500
these are important things to understand

432
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,599
but also to protect

433
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,038
protect from an intellectual property

434
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,439
standpoint

435
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,298
most recently in Mexico City

436
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,220
Mexico City

437
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,918
there are dispensaries the dispensaries

438
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,440
are not legal but they operate they look

439
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,360
they feel they smell

440
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,860
like a dispensary that you walk into in

441
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,599
Southern California

442
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,639
and guess what

443
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,899
all of the products in that dispensary

444
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,759
are branded like California products

445
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,960
so the question becomes which I didn't

446
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,119
ask

447
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,620
it's driving here from California or

448
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,439
didn't you simply print it on the

449
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:10,199
packaging it's a little bit of both but

450
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,620
my point to you is protect your brand

451
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,240
protect your intellectual property today

452
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,979
the protection exists in multiple

453
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,980
jurisdictions that multiple

454
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,000
jurisdictional registration can protect

455
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
you

456
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,660
it can be enforceable

457
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,740
despite the Cannabis nature of the

458
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,720
industry

459
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,298
and that's an important thing to protect

460
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,660
because if you're not protecting that or

461
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:35,940
are you taking steps to develop your

462
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,980
brand beyond the boundaries of your

463
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,038
country for example

464
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,140
if I have a solution here in Germany and

465
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,359
I have a THC brand

466
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,179
but I want to go to the next country the

467
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,939
one that I predict is going to be next

468
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,519
what if I did a soft launch without the

469
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,558
problem I created CBD products with the

470
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,940
same branding and same packaging in a

471
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,940
jurisdiction that was lawful but didn't

472
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,100
allow THC products that model has worked

473
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,679
all over the United States marijuana

474
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:06,599
brands in the U.S have gone into new

475
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,880
jurisdictions that allow for CBD from

476
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:11,038
industrial hemp and created the brand

477
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,620
awareness and brand recognition before

478
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,379
the market allowed for THC products to

479
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:18,779
be sold in that market

480
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,880
industrial HEPA applications we're not

481
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:23,639
here to talk about him but that's very

482
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,679
exciting and as I mentioned cannabinoids

483
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,159
from hemp can be aggregated all over the

484
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,559
course of thousands of hectares or Acres

485
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,539
and when you have cannabinoids guess

486
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,460
what

487
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:36,960
cannabinoids are cannabinoids

488
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,140
it doesn't matter whether I get my

489
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,940
cannabinoids from marijuana or hemp

490
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,000
the concentration in the individual

491
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,960
plantable matter but that's dictated by

492
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,960
what the consumers want

493
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:53,339
we're seeing major exporters we talk

494
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,619
about Colombia recently changing the law

495
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:58,439
which by the way

496
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:01,139
for those of you non-legal Minds in the

497
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,419
room there's legislation

498
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,460
and there's regulations legislation

499
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:08,220
requires elected officials to vote on

500
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,500
something typically the top executive

501
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,019
would sign that law into effect

502
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,839
but the regulations the regulations the

503
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:18,740
details how something is done

504
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:22,740
that's left to agencies

505
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,319
agencies can change rules very quickly

506
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,179
it doesn't require voting of a

507
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,619
legislature does it require political

508
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,600
capital

509
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,859
regulations can change very quickly and

510
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,899
that's exactly

511
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,819
what happened in Colombia recently when

512
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,580
they were only allowing exportation of

513
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,678
oil and they have shifted the policy to

514
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:43,079
also allow for the exportation of flower

515
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,298
why because they recognize a global

516
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,579
market need for flour

517
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:49,259
the country was producing flour The

518
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:50,699
Operators were not doing so well because

519
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:53,099
they didn't have the capital to build

520
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,659
out their own extraction facilities and

521
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,719
they changed the rates they changed the

522
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,880
law and that allowed for exploitation

523
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,140
uh China is the largest cultivator of

524
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,299
hemp in the world if you didn't know

525
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,620
that I was in China advising the Chinese

526
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:09,720
FDA in 2016. in 2016 they told me there

527
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,459
was no THC in that country

528
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,980
we did a test on one of their head

529
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,360
clients a 14-foot hemp plan two months

530
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,038
prior to harvest

531
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:22,379
it didn't flower like a traditional

532
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:24,359
marijuana plant but it was 13 THC

533
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,620
so they use it for industrial uses so it

534
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,479
does I guess it didn't matter at the

535
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,099
time my point to you is that countries

536
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,259
look at things very differently you know

537
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,819
that I may be stating the obvious but

538
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:34,980
it's for you to figure it out and create

539
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,418
that as an asset for your business or

540
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,000
your opportunity

541
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,640
Israel has an insatiable demand for

542
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,099
product right now uh the United States

543
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,140
from a Industrial Hemp perspective

544
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,538
Germany of course

545
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,120
um Australia for medicinal purposes very

546
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:55,099
strictly and Brazil I think Brazil

547
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:58,019
changes the global landscape immediately

548
00:22:55,099 --> 00:23:00,139
210 plus million people

549
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,579
with a nationalized Health Care system

550
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:07,100
that on their own

551
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:07,099
adopted the use of medicinal cannabis

552
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,219
with a nationalized healthcare system if

553
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,759
I didn't mention that already and Visa

554
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,319
it is a market to watch closely does it

555
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,819
mean that Europeans will be shipping

556
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,819
products to

557
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:23,220
Brazil no but what it does mean is that

558
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,619
the other Latin American nations will

559
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,600
and that will open up opportunities in

560
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:30,239
the in Europe and in this region of the

561
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,099
world that is now being satisfied from

562
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,579
Latin American exports

563
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:38,099
follow these Trends watch those trends

564
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:39,298
I want you to really take away the four

565
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:42,719
elements

566
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:44,759
of the Global Campus supply chain when I

567
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,600
talk about these four elements I talk

568
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,700
about them as four policy Lanes okay the

569
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,619
first one please think about these

570
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,159
because you need to place your company

571
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,899
in one of these four lanes if you don't

572
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,299
or if you're an investor and you haven't

573
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,580
figured out which lane you play in

574
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:03,599
you're going to lose your dollars if

575
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:05,639
you're an operator and you don't know

576
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,500
which lane you plan the business is not

577
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,960
going to succeed we've seen it for 13

578
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,940
years the first lady

579
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,298
OTC dispensary model

580
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:18,419
this means that I walk into a store and

581
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:20,579
I could purchase high THC flour

582
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:23,340
I can purchase a number of other high

583
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:26,099
THC products over the counter what

584
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:28,980
qualifies me to buy that maybe I'm a

585
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:31,980
patient with a specific condition

586
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,360
maybe I'm just 21 years old if it's an

587
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,819
adult use Market

588
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,000
that's over-the-counter marijuana do you

589
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:40,918
plan that lane what are you playing

590
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,079
you're going to jump down to the to the

591
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,840
second one after pharmaceutical

592
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:50,579
ingredients this is medical marijuana

593
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:52,439
folks API grade ingredients

594
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:55,740
that's medicine

595
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,380
those will be formulations approved by

596
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,519
the equivalent of the FDA

597
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,520
in every jurisdiction

598
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,240
it will be real medicine if I have a

599
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,860
condition I go to a doctor the doctor

600
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,200
will say it will take years to get there

601
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:12,959
but the doctor will say take this tablet

602
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,120
that may not be for some of us maybe any

603
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,640
of us in this room that understand the

604
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,739
benefits of the natural plant but will

605
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,020
exist and it does exist and we shouldn't

606
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,659
be scared of it we should not be scared

607
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:27,179
of pharmaceutical companies working in

608
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:29,880
this industry it's just another Lane

609
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,940
it exists side by side with the OTC

610
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,520
cannabis thirdly industrial I don't need

611
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,580
to go into that it speaks for itself

612
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,720
cellulose lignin sugar fuels plastic

613
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:45,379
building materials fiber

614
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,058
50 000 uses

615
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,700
wellness and nutraceuticals this is the

616
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:53,879
lane that would be non-intoxicating

617
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,058
cannabinoids primarily derived from

618
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,820
Industrial Hemp right so if I take CBD

619
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:01,798
out of a hemp plan if I take CBN out of

620
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:03,298
a hemp plan and I create those

621
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,700
formulations

622
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,740
those are over-the-counter nutraceutical

623
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,819
or wellness products they're rich in

624
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,819
proteins

625
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:15,298
Omega-3s omega-6s and they contain

626
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:17,939
cannabinoids it's a different Lane

627
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:19,740
so please understand where you fit the

628
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,840
biggest thing I can encourage all of you

629
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,798
to do in this room is understand your

630
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,658
context this is a fragmented

631
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:31,500
decentralized industry please understand

632
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:34,500
your context what you are where you fit

633
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,900
or else you won't succeed and I want you

634
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,659
all to succeed we all do

635
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,580
the versatility of cannabis

636
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,260
all right let's talk about this for a

637
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:45,359
moment this is not what you came here to

638
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,859
talk about but fiber is making a major

639
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,740
push

640
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:53,219
this fiber from a marijuana crop have

641
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,259
any value not really you want long

642
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,600
fibers that's the added value for

643
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,519
industrial hemp

644
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,199
you want long fibers and those fibers

645
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,538
are being developed in terms of

646
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,340
infrastructure for so many uses from

647
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,400
textiles of door paneling and

648
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,980
Automobiles

649
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,919
the Plastics and whatnot

650
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,558
wellness and nutraceuticals speaks for

651
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,659
itself you see those main uses of

652
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,879
cannabis to the right and ultimately

653
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:22,620
those things are all happening so will

654
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,840
somebody come and buy your stocks in

655
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:27,359
your stem and your waste material from

656
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:30,298
you not just for extracting that extra

657
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:33,599
one percent THC out of it but for

658
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:34,558
industrial uses maybe maybe in the

659
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,439
future

660
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,119
but Industrial Hemp is designed to do

661
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,460
all of the above including produced

662
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,259
cannabinoids in Mass

663
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,819
you guys know the products you've seen

664
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,558
the products out there you're familiar

665
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:49,379
with the products

666
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,599
this is an example of what the

667
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,899
marketplace looks like today

668
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,819
it looks like fiber products

669
00:27:54,898 --> 00:28:00,178
over-the-counter medicinal or wellness

670
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:01,740
products vape pens apply these to hemp

671
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,038
and or marijuana

672
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,240
apply wafer board or fiberboard on the

673
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,278
end from Industrial

674
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,079
this is why this industry is not going

675
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:13,019
anywhere but it's also why you need to

676
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,599
understand the supply chain because it's

677
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:18,538
not just intoxicating materials from the

678
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,939
plant and by the way with more

679
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,500
uniformity with more people

680
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,200
participating

681
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,538
yeah intoxicating products out of the

682
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,419
industry doesn't get more valuable

683
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:32,700
either as I mentioned it gets less value

684
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,899
when you create more opportunities and

685
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,840
standardized

686
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:39,719
so understand the entirety of the plan

687
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,599
some product categories that are poised

688
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,819
for growth we see Cosmetics whether

689
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:48,298
those Cosmetics include

690
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:50,480
CBD for example or THC depending on the

691
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:54,240
different systems you see the Cosmetic

692
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,460
development going a while across Latin

693
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,659
America it's the first products that

694
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,700
we're seeing in many Latin

695
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,020
american-based stores lawfully or

696
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,179
otherwise

697
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:04,558
there's some of the first products that

698
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,899
we see going through marijuana

699
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,538
dispensaries with high THC for topical

700
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:10,918
application and of course products

701
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:12,240
across the United States and around the

702
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,240
world

703
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,759
pet products pet products we had a

704
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,140
Uruguayan fine of ours A Week Ago

705
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:24,778
getting a 15-year contract

706
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,538
15-year Supply contract for cannabinoids

707
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:30,200
including THC for pet products in

708
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:32,759
Southeast Asia these Agreements are real

709
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,100
they exist today

710
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,919
please understand that and don't get

711
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:40,558
caught up in everything in your world

712
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,980
because understanding to look up is very

713
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:42,980
important

714
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:49,140
important concept in the states recently

715
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,319
by the way

716
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,020
the DEA sent out a letter

717
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,819
in response to a lawyer's inquiry

718
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,460
that letter said there's really no

719
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:01,639
distinction between heaven and marijuana

720
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,558
in fact every seed is presumed then

721
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,880
until it's harvested because you can't

722
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,339
determine whether it's point three

723
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,659
percent THC until the time of harvest

724
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,939
legally

725
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,260
Well That Shook things up so all of

726
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,659
these European countries that have

727
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:18,058
produced hemp seeds marijuana seeds over

728
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:20,520
the years are rushing to the U.S market

729
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:22,798
but you'll see that distinction between

730
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,500
seeds as long as they're stable and

731
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:28,918
registered under various oecd or the

732
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,599
equivalent functions can be utilized

733
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,520
some of the investment Trends as we

734
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,798
bring this to an end where are the

735
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,898
dollars going uh Geographic source of

736
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,398
funds we see a lot more money outside of

737
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:40,500
the United States than coming from the

738
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,759
United States although as I mentioned if

739
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,460
you're locked on your jurisdiction

740
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,019
licensed appropriately public markets

741
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,038
and capital markets are available to you

742
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,839
in the U.S

743
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,179
uh what's the purpose for the funding

744
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,158
are you building out facilities are you

745
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,120
expanding are you hiring people where

746
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,919
are you going to spend your money

747
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,859
matters it matters to supply payment

748
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,038
matters and trends

749
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,778
domestic versus export that matters I

750
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:05,879
would suggest very strongly that if the

751
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:08,038
U.S passes the safe Banking Act or the

752
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,679
crime Act

753
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,720
that the international companies have a

754
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,759
much better chance

755
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,220
of operating in North America because

756
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,259
the U.S companies tend to exist and

757
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,740
survive sometimes in spite of themselves

758
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:24,658
because this stuff sells itself

759
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,940
whereas International companies have had

760
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,159
to go through many more Hoops operate

761
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,320
much more complex outbreak much more

762
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,840
sophisticated fashion those are things

763
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:36,000
that I would pay attention to

764
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,918
product verticals to avoid intoxicating

765
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,019
products from hemp

766
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,480
um we see that Delta eight

767
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:45,240
Delta 10 a number of these products much

768
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,720
aligned but something to consider high

769
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,038
THC products the products themselves are

770
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,960
not necessarily being shipped

771
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:55,259
internationally but the base materials

772
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,919
are the novel cannabinoids I touched on

773
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:59,879
that with intoxicating products

774
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,220
smokable

775
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,559
smokable head who thought that was

776
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,880
coming we see that as a trend in U.S

777
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,918
states that don't have lawful marijuana

778
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,380
people smoke out

779
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,380
produces a mild buzz but it's probably

780
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,480
not what the people are looking for

781
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,000
at the end of the day this number is

782
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,620
wrong

783
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,398
23.6 billion I saw an article this

784
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,939
morning

785
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,158
it said 75 billion dollars by 2030.

786
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,960
roughly half of that in the U.S North

787
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,820
America half of that International in

788
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,460
the aggregate that's what I think we're

789
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:34,619
looking at guys that's the opportunity

790
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,200
here and participate in that

791
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:40,979
International Aggregate and when the U.S

792
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,380
opens up access the capital for U.S

793
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,360
based companies the opportunity will be

794
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,860
yours because you'll have gone through

795
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,939
hoops that are much more stringent and

796
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,259
significant

797
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,298
okay

798
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:53,460
at the end of the day

799
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:55,079
the next presentation of the bow is

800
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,600
about market conditions I urge you to

801
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,519
listen and listen technically to that

802
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,819
because that will flesh out this broad

803
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,038
end of the funnel with some concrete

804
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:07,439
details and then right after that at 5

805
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,179
PM it's another conversation which would

806
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,360
be great about the global supply chain

807
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:13,919
look so marry these things together put

808
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,379
a few of these things in your bag of

809
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,600
tricks and please don't ever ever

810
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,120
hesitate to reach out to myself and my

811
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,619
partners anybody at Clark Kent

812
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,018
if you're looking to participate

813
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:27,058
globally please take a look at the gcnc

814
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:29,700
the global cannabis Network Collective

815
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:31,558
is an aggregation to network the top

816
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,840
players around the world and we're very

817
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:35,519
proud to have many of them here thank

818
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,529
you for your attention thanks for

819
