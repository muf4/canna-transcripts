00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,719
the largest Medical Market Germany in

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,000
today's session we will zoom out and

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,280
take a macro view across the global

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,738
medical cannabis sector

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,260
to discuss some of the key trends market

20
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,479
dynamics and considerations when

21
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,820
operating in new regions

22
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,000
outside of Germany we see a number of

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,980
interesting medical cannabis Frameworks

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
Australia in the UK in particular have

25
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,718
seen notable growth rates in the last

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,659
few years and with the limited pilot in

27
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,659
France and unique Frameworks in Italy

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,000
and Portugal there is a lot to discuss

29
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,100
despite this there are still regulatory

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,260
blockers hindering these medical markets

31
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,478
and we also want to discuss some of

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,460
those hindrances today

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,739
it's a pleasure to be joined by such a

34
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,359

00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,018
vertically integrated and we are

78
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,620
exporting these medicines across the

79
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,780
globe to patients and we have a really

80
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,780
big focus on the European market it's

81
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,640
such a special market and really looking

82
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,560
forward to you know joining this great

83
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,119
panel today so thank you for being here

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
and listening to us

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,959
fantastic

86
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,458
um so I'd like to kick off today by

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,239
talking a little bit about patient

88
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,158
access and medical Frameworks Gosha and

89
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,378
flita um you both have experience

90
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,378
operating in a number of key Emerging

91
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:47,639
Markets such as Australia Portugal and

92
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:49,018
Poland

93
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,899
um I'm Keen to hear from both of you

94
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,480
maybe to kick off how has the over or

95
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,480
the under regulation led to supply

96
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:01,518
shortages for patients or a lack of

97
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,518
diversity in product formats

98
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,319
um I think so let's go back a step if I

99
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,438
can and I think it's really important to

100
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:14,399
recognize that each country has its own

101
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:17,759
unique Juris or a regulation or um

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,139
regime and I think that's it comes back

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,819
to each business and I'm just going to

104
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,620
speak at a business front to begin with

105
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,360
is what is the business model to begin

106
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,439
with because which markets do you want

107
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,180
to play in because it's not like you can

108
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,978
send to Germany and you can send to all

109
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,379
the countries in Europe the EU are just

110
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,120
not aligned like that and that was a big

111
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,040
learning curve coming from Australia

112
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,680
when we were exported through a mutual

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,840
recognition agreement initially into

114
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,199
Europe we have to understand the unique

115
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:49,500
jurisdictions legislation and because of

116
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,319
that the patient access system is really

117
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,660
different in each of these markets in

118
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,300
Australia it's a huge demand at the

119
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,860
moment there and we we our patients

120
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,460
access it through a special Access

121
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,280
program through GPS and specialists who

122
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:08,099
can prescribe whereby there are other

123
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,619
countries in the UK very restricted in

124
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,320
terms of patient access at the moment

125
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,879
it's growing it has potential but right

126
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,240
now it's only Specialists that are

127
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,918
actually prescribing there and then look

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
France is a very different cattle

129
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,538
official together you know that's just a

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,939
pilot program several companies are

131
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:29,759
including a little green farmer are a

132
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,800
part of that trial and again it's a very

133
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,520
closed system but we hope that that will

134
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,579
catalyze in the next coming years to a

135
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,139
legal Market there and I guess coming

136
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,439
back to your your question or just about

137
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,960
the product registration side of things

138
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,699
every country is different yes it might

139
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,339
have to be approved by the local

140
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,800
authorities but if you look at Poland

141
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,779
for example you have to go through a

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,180
product registration process or a

143
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,519
marketing authorization process and the

144
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,740
same for Portugal and that can take two

145
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,659
to three years to actually happen

146
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,759
and of course when it's over regulated

147
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,500
it is very hard for patients to access

148
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,360
because there are limited products

149
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,220
available but often that's how an

150
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,060
industry actually begins

151
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,860
yes I will also add um uh thank you

152
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,019
because we have very very similar

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,900
experience but I would like to add

154
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:28,258
mainly that when you the countries out

155
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:31,198
of Europe like Israel Australia Canada

156
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,979
for example wants to enter uh European

157
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,020
uh Market first it's not only business

158
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,818
strategy but it's mainly regulatory

159
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,779
strategy so you are already cracking

160
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:45,300
regulatory puff country by country how

161
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,818
you can register your product first of

162
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,939
all what is the frames regulatory frames

163
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,280
because some countries as as felita you

164
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,740
said are very similar approach like

165
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,079
Magister formulation we know that it's

166
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,240
in Germany in Switzerland in Italy in

167
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,680
Poland and some other European countries

168
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,418
but for example Poland my origin country

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,459
is very specific because

170
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:12,299
um you have to submit full marketing

171
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:14,939
authorization dossier of uh

172
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,280
pharmaceutical raw material it's mean if

173
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,379
you are registering like propylene

174
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,559
glycer or I don't know any other solvent

175
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:26,519
it's the same heavy quality the sale

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,038
like medical cannabis so we can say that

177
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,339
a patient will wait for a little green

178
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,978
Pharma product for example in Poland up

179
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:38,279
to two years for flowers and maybe up to

180
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:40,620
four or five years for extracts so how

181
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:43,679
is going on now in Poland on the market

182
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,478
you have maybe in like in real life in

183
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,478
the pharmacy I don't know four or five

184
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,758
type of different flowers and only one

185
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,860
on two extracts which is crazy if you

186
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,080
compare it with with German markets

187
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,979
which is oversaturated I don't know more

188
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:01,198
than 100 different flowers and and maybe

189
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,939
80 or 90 different extracts so the

190
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,319
doctors in Germany they don't know how

191
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:08,879
to even prescribe so it's like

192
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,098
from French we can say for the patients

193
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,000
and doctors and then what is going on to

194
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:17,279
back to Poland also that the even the

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,439
registrated products which are

196
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:23,459
prescribed by the doctors are high THC

197
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:26,098
and only one flower is balanced uh CBD

198
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,439
thc88 so if patients are searching for

199
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:32,639
CBD flowers for example CBD products

200
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,580
they will go to the to the hemp shops I

201
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,338
don't have any problem with the hemp

202
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,038
shops but the regulation for you know

203
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,500
this CBD food supplement products are

204
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,419
not so strict not controlled so

205
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,299
sometimes the labels we don't know what

206
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,299
is inside so I think that regulation yes

207
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:53,759
but maybe not over regulation and for

208
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,159
sure we should control quality of the

209
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,679
products because we know very well it's

210
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,719
not only the the

211
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,419
label regarding the API content but also

212
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,899
the heavy metals so all the toxins which

213
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:08,939
can be very toxic for the patient so yes

214
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,419
I think that in Europe we are struggling

215
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,940
with this lack of harmonization from

216
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,219
European Union because we know that from

217
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,800
pharmaceutical industry there's always

218
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,220
the harmonized path to access the the

219
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:25,740
European market but in case of cannabis

220
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,620
it's really National path and and so

221
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,080
many countries still are waiting to have

222
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,778
the regulation and we are all waiting

223
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,259
how the Pharma European pharmacopeia or

224
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:39,720
hmpc for example will classify a medical

225
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:43,259
cannabis so I think the patient are like

226
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,620
initiators of um of Regulation we see it

227
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,778
in Spain for example it's still ongoing

228
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,060
and uh we'll see we are looking forward

229
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:53,639
what will be the next steps but France

230
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,919
also was initiated by by the Association

231
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,080
of patients and we still have this

232
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,620
extension of one additional year of

233
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,080
French a pilot project and um hopefully

234
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,600
next year we'll have the regulation in

235
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,839
in France to to let the patient have a

236
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,420
regular access and control access to the

237
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,000
product a very similar way that we

238
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,399
started in Canada uh very challenging at

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,659
the beginning when we first started uh

240
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,220
we would ask people to go to their

241
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,659
doctor to get their authorization and

242
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,160
they would say my doctor doesn't

243
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,600
authorize they threaten to kick me out

244
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,939
of their Clinic if I use cannabis so

245
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,220
that was in 2013 so we had to create

246
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,680
cannabis clinics which are ways for

247
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,660
patients to come in and get educated uh

248
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,458
of course licensed producers had to fund

249
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,199
this and we couldn't pay doctors because

250
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,579
that's illegal of course but we had to

251
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,140
find other ways to fund it because no

252
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,580
one else was funding it otherwise the

253
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,259
patients would be paying and we didn't

254
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,600
want the patients to pay so what

255
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,278
happened was now with legalization the

256
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,778
doctors are no longer scared that

257
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,120
they're the gatekeeper they were before

258
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,500
forced to be the controller of cannabis

259
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,360
because if the doctor didn't authorize

260
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,278
no one was getting cannabis of course

261
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,839
that's not true but that's how they felt

262
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,519
and they were worried about the college

263
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,899
coming down on them but now the

264
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,459
recreational happened and people can

265
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,620
just go by cannabis across the street

266
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,078
everywhere anyone who goes to a doctor

267
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,120
are actual real medical patients and no

268
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:10,739
longer are doctors afraid anymore and

269
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
you know it takes a long time here we

270
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,459
are 10 years later so just a quick

271
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,320
thought on that no thank you and I think

272
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,639
that Taps into something at least so I

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,459
know we were having a quick chat about

274
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,139
just before we came in which was how a

275
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,539
lot of the market dialogue is about how

276
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,039
flower still dominates and and there's

277
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,259
various reasoning for that I mean

278
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,699
doctors have conflicting preferences

279
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,539
sometimes they're preferring a more

280
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,860
controlled dose to product but what are

281
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:36,778
the kind of dynamics that are at play

282
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,778
here it's not just potentially patient

283
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:41,759
Trends but price and accessibility

284
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,559
um I think uh what we have to understand

285
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,480
in Germany is that there are different

286
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,699
groups of patients there are patients

287
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,579
that get their prescription via the Paya

288
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,860
via the doctor and the doctor suggested

289
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,259
because he may think that's the best

290
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,600
type of therapy unfortunately that's

291
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,000
still the least common variant I would

292
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,420
say we have these patients who are

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,919
voluntary or unvoluntary self-payers

294
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:09,120
that are mostly in the flower section

295
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:11,519
where there's also a huge huge kind of

296
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,200
availability of products I mean the good

297
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,659
thing that we can say is that prices

298
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,300
meanwhile are below illegal market

299
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,919
prices which I think is some very great

300
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,838
achievement but still we have a lot of

301
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,699
bottlenecks that patients have to jump

302
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,040
through in order to get a prescription

303
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,440
in order to get maybe reimbursement by

304
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,719
the health insurance but you can see

305
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,579
that it's an ongoing discussion and that

306
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,680
the government is trying to make some

307
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:36,000
some improvements in that regard last

308
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,159
week for example

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
um Miss kapad konta was on the panel

310
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,019
here before she announced that um there

311
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,519
will be like uh like a short a short

312
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,440
image of the time you have to wait till

313
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,539
your application can be approved and

314
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,480
also there may be some doctors um that

315
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,399
get like where you the application does

316
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,259
not need to be happen and so they can

317
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,778
just prescribe which would also be great

318
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,919
but it's baby steps and baby steps and

319
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,799
we're really

320
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:04,620
um developing on on a micro level if you

321
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,199
want to say so for sure and in terms of

322
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,659
that blur as you say between people

323
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,940
liking it and funny easier and actually

324
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,799
better quality products often from the

325
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,180
illicit Market do you think the entrance

326
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,399
and maybe Alex will also have some

327
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,979
insight here from Canada of the entrance

328
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,139
of categories like live rosin and hash

329
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,720
and and more kind of recreational style

330
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,100
formats carts for example

331
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,379
um can help with some of this and can

332
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,839
help bring patients on that potentially

333
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,399
uh into flower absolutely and I get this

334
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,019
question all the time coming to Berlin I

335
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,120
mean let's be honest people in Europe

336
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,860
love to smoke Israel loves to smoke

337
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,200
there's certain places and they just

338
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,959
they just love to smoke but uh bless you

339
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,579
and uh the difference is these other

340
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,039
forms are just much better medical

341
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:49,259
products and here I am so many years

342
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,879
later having the same discussion once

343
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,679
you allow these other formats in they're

344
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,500
a lot more consistent they're a lot more

345
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,458
clear you know again I love flower as

346
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,778
well but when you're talking about

347
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,518
medicine there's just so many better

348
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:01,679
ways and you know we're making the joke

349
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,879
backstage how in California when I was

350
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,638
there a few years ago they talk about

351
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:09,419
distillate as hot dog water that is like

352
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,579
the lowest form of input and look if you

353
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:14,879
can't afford a higher input it's fine

354
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:17,219
but for those that can and want to Hash

355
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,559
Ross and live resin these are way more

356
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,420
pure full spectrum much better effect

357
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,979
you can try five milligrams of

358
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,078
distillate versus five milligrams of

359
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,060
hash rosin edible it's completely

360
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,500
different and I know we're not talking

361
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,059
about that yet in Europe you're just

362
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,220
starting to get your markets established

363
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,539
but this is where it's going and and you

364
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,980
need to kind prepare for that and

365
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,679
especially as a medical product I'm

366
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,820
sorry smoking cannabis as a medicine I

367
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,679
know it seems like that's what you're

368
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,120
fighting for but you're going to be like

369
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,319
five to ten years in the future and

370
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,060
you'll be like oh my God I can't even

371
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,160
believe we were even saying that so

372
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,379
that's that's

373
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,059
thanks can I can I just head on to that

374
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:54,240
as well I think that the concentrates

375
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:57,479
whether it's live rosin resin they're

376
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,100
very pure and the volume and the intake

377
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,440
is probably lower there will be

378
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,600
applications it's about finding a way to

379
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,000
do that safely and obviously to register

380
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,600
those processes but let's not forget

381
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,879
that it's less unadulterated

382
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,800
and there therefore

383
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,320
um the Entourage effect which we all

384
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,179
know will play a really big part less

385
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,100
terpenes are lost less active

386
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,778
ingredients so I think we're mad to

387
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,420
think it's not going to happen it's just

388
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:27,120
a matter of of when and how

389
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,599
I just wanted to add regarding the also

390
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,759
product and back to the regulatory

391
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,060
strategy we are facing in Europe still

392
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,278
the problem that we have only two

393
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,979
countries currently in Europe allowing

394
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,799
finished product registration so we have

395
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,539
Portugal and we have France but France

396
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:51,240
is still not under this pilot trial so

397
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:54,659
we cannot introduce the new product now

398
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,220
but this is also like a kind of problem

399
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:59,879
for the company's pharmaceutical

400
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,100
companies to bring this delay to

401
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,198
purified extract to the market because

402
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,778
when you have the monster regulation

403
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:09,539
under Magister formulation you are

404
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:11,458
bringing to the pharmacist kind of yeah

405
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,439
pharmaceutical raw material and the

406
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:16,018
pharmacist must formulate to continue

407
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
formulating under Medusa formulation the

408
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,278
pharmacy

409
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,198
uh we know that in Poland and I told you

410
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,500
that there is only a few flowers and one

411
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:27,240
or two extracts registered but the the

412
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,000
pharmacists police pharmacies are very

413
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,100
Innovative so how they are doing because

414
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,799
for information you can have per

415
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,600
prescription in Poland a purified extra

416
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:41,278
85 THC with the prescription or legally

417
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,399
so how it's how it's going on it's

418
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,740
pharmacies it's really in this Pharmacy

419
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:50,039
the extraction equipment so he's doing

420
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,399
this ancient way extraction so he has a

421
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:55,620
crude extract then he's standardizing it

422
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:59,399
and then purifying to obtain this uh

423
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,799
highly purified 85 percent per percent

424
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,640
um extract for the vaporization so yes

425
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:09,178
it's possible it's only one product

426
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:13,079
currently in in Poland but and obviously

427
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:15,240
from from like even price perspective uh

428
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,558
Poland has no no reimbursement so

429
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,980
everything is from the pocket of the

430
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:24,418
patient but they can access this uh

431
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,699
Vapes if we can know from legal uh legal

432
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:29,700
sources and especially with the high

433
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:33,440
quality and and Purity but regarding

434
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:36,058
also about the the purified extract

435
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,820
every patient is aware about Entourage

436
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:41,879
effect so it's it's not only searching

437
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:44,399
for TC CBD the patient we know are

438
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,500
searching for specific serpents so

439
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,320
there's also the way to enrich this

440
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,419
purified extracts to I think it's our

441
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,819
role now as a pharmaceutical companies

442
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:55,380
to bring to the market maybe

443
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:58,200
complementary I don't want to say food

444
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,020
supplement but why not the blend of the

445
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,360
turpents to complete like to give give

446
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:06,720
away a package or kit for the patient

447
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,359
which a medical doctor can supervise and

448
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,640
and advice for example because we we

449
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,279
have these large knowledge about

450
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,559
turpents or even other synergistic

451
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,418
herbals so this is something which we

452
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,940
must ask pharmaceutical companies to

453
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,940
introduce because we are limited by this

454
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,798
regulatory path of Magister formulation

455
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,360
and of course hope that in most of the

456
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,500
countries will allow to have finished

457
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,418
product

458
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,058
and along with that will come education

459
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:35,160
because it's so key to educate our

460
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,558
stakeholders including our doctors you

461
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,600
know how to prescribe such different

462
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,119
different products and unique Delivery

463
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,099
Systems yes and you mentioned earlier

464
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,199
obviously um you know the fact that in

465
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:47,459
Australia General Practitioners can

466
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,500
prescribe which obviously we don't have

467
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,058
yet in the UK would you say there were

468
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,859
on any other factors that have

469
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:55,319
contributed to this growth that we've

470
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:56,639
seen in the Australian Medical Market in

471
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,678
particular

472
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
yeah there are a couple of things um the

473
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,360
first one is actually doctoral education

474
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,000
I think that is huge now you know it's

475
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,979
up to us as producers and and everybody

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,319
in this room to have a part in the

477
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,779
education process because that's how an

478
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,700
industry evolves uh it or it obviously

479
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,339
starts from patient demand but then we

480
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,160
need to educate doctors it's the 80 20

481
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:22,678
rule so you'll have a handful of doctors

482
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,140
who are your main prescribers but that's

483
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,320
definitely growing we've got over 5 000

484
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,900
prescribers now in Australia and the

485
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,579
other reason and it's it's there we

486
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,679
haven't really talked about it and that

487
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:37,439
is in most markets it's the Quasi

488
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,538
medical where the recreational and those

489
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,019
using it for self-medicating purposes

490
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:45,058
access it legally through the um you

491
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,579
know the regime or the the legal process

492
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,440
because why not you know you would argue

493
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,538
that the quality is safer just in terms

494
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,240
of extraction techniques and what have

495
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:57,359
you you get the consistent the same

496
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,819
supply all the time it's a and most

497
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,979
importantly it's legal

498
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,659
I will also add something regarding the

499
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,058
education of the doctors and thank you

500
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,640
flita to touching these sensitive points

501
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:10,319
it's not I after education but of course

502
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,960
because they are used to have the

503
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,480
clinical data or some support and we

504
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,340
know all that this plant with we are

505
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,779
discovering every day some some

506
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,538
publication and there is a lot of

507
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,779
clinical trials observational studies

508
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:26,400
but after the the trainings we we know

509
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,918
it from France for example the doctors

510
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,660
must to practice and then have this

511
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,000
relationship with the patient very close

512
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,120
to take the the feedbacks from there

513
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,819
because it's constant interaction I

514
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,879
would add also in this relationship the

515
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:44,759
pharmacist so back to France we know

516
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,520
that the first year the doctors were

517
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,700
prescribing a high CBD product to to

518
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,038
treat the pain and after a few months

519
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:56,100
patients were just not happy and they

520
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,960
stopped this uh um they stopped they

521
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:00,839
asked to withdraw we withdrawn from the

522
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,900
from the project effect because they

523
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,819
didn't receive any any relief so only

524
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,919
after one year the the French doctors

525
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,139
they just learned that maybe they should

526
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,320
start titration with the balanced

527
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:16,080
product and then to to obviously start

528
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,659
Slow and Low but that increase this uh

529
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,819
this content of THC I think there's the

530
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,058
huge stigma about THC everyone is very

531
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:26,279
afraid of THC and and the doctors needs

532
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:27,859
to practice and have interaction because

533
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,480
it's really like personalized medicine

534
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:33,240
so interaction close interaction with

535
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,380
the with the with the patient and and in

536
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,079
the other countries like Magister

537
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,640
formulation in this duo we have to add

538
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,199
the pharmacies because it's really like

539
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,620
pharmacists who is doing this module

540
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,840
formulation but he may do it only if he

541
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,099
has a prescription so if for example you

542
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,839
would like to introduce some very

543
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:51,779
Innovative formats I don't know some

544
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,759
topicals or even I don't know liposomal

545
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,859
Solutions we have to first of all

546
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,379
educate the doctors that yes we will

547
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,538
introduce it through the pharmacist so

548
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,400
we the we are initiate like the

549
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:05,099
prescription then the pharmacist is

550
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,360
formulating in the pharmacy so and you

551
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,939
actually said something really important

552
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,219
uh the follow-up we did tons of doctor

553
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,140
education if they don't practice it

554
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,640
doesn't do anything so what we would say

555
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,500
to them is why don't you find a few

556
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,840
patients that nothing else is working

557
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,640
for try those patients and then follow

558
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,959
up with them and what the doctor has

559
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,280
found because I would go to a lot of

560
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,720
medical conferences every year and I

561
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,859
would see the same doctors and they

562
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,058
would at first they were very skeptical

563
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,379
then they were like you know I tried it

564
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:29,460
with a few patients and you know it's

565
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,080
kind of working and one of the funny

566
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,000
things they would say to me is you know

567
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:34,619
either this cannabis stuff is working or

568
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,419
all the patients are coming together and

569
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,379
agreeing on what they're saying to me

570
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,900
because they're all saying the same

571
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,520
thing and either it's working or they're

572
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,679
just all working together to like trick

573
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,658
me so after a while they realize it is

574
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,059
legitimate and it is helping but it's

575
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,919
all in the follow-up and pharmacists

576
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:51,839
which only now in Canada are getting

577
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,038
involved is the secret to it because

578
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,480
they're the ones that are more following

579
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,579
up they're the ones monitoring the other

580
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,620
medication the doctors can't be expected

581
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,199
to do all that and I think that's a big

582
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:02,639
help yeah I think like the pharmacists

583
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,440
are actually like an interesting point

584
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,940
because if you think about it in Germany

585
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,460
we have had the prescription of Thrones

586
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,380
which is pure THC for ages like the

587
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,360
pharmacists I have the impression that

588
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,679
they feel comfortable working with it

589
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,959
the doctors feel more comfortable

590
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,519
prescribing it there's more like this

591
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,000
barrier in the mind for the flower

592
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,639
products and for the extracts but I

593
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,220
think also that we owe a lot of the

594
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,320
progress that we have in Germany to some

595
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,480
very motivated pharmacists who want to

596
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,279
become experts who are working together

597
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,339
with doctors to get these prescriptions

598
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,619
or who are there to maybe do test

599
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,119
filling of cartridges like let's if you

600
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,859
look at in Germany for the extract

601
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,139
products there's only one extract

602
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,019
available for inhalation all the other

603
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,538
extracts are basically oral Solutions

604
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:50,700
and but there are also pharmacists who

605
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:52,379
are processing flour into extracts for

606
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,659
example so there are possibilities

607
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,419
through the magistrial preparation and I

608
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,580
think it's uh quite interesting to get

609
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:02,340
the pharmacist also involved as well as

610
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,658
doctor because you need both right are

611
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,980
there any pharmacists in the room here

612
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,659
is there any pharmacists here checking

613
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,339
out only a couple in the back all right

614
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,799
awesome let's talk to them they're smart

615
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,639
sorry

616
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:12,960
fantastic

617
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,820
um and I'm Keen to hear from all of you

618
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,000
actually how do different countries

619
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,038
trees approaches to which conditions are

620
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,940
eligible for medical cannabis how does

621
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,940
that impact access

622
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,440
yeah I think most countries are probably

623
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:31,038
relatively conservative when they begin

624
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,259
and do restrict to a number of

625
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:37,440
conditions epilepsy pain tends to be in

626
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:40,740
there so cancer or going through chemo

627
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,000
treatment and Ms and I just feel

628
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:47,700
rightly or wrongly that it's based on

629
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,859
what the perceived evidence is

630
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,779
and I feel that there is so much more

631
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,759
data out there now that we need to just

632
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,558
open our eyes because it is there we're

633
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,558
getting a huge amount of data being

634
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:00,000
gathered from Real World evidence but we

635
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,099
do know that governments need to be

636
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,960
conservative particularly to begin with

637
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:06,779
and so if they restrict to a certain

638
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,179
number of conditions but we have seen

639
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:11,038
that that quickly evolves and take

640
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:14,038
Australia for example they have now

641
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,440
prescribed for over 200 different

642
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,900
medical conditions it started off with

643
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,298
just five so that was you know within

644
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,820
four years it got to over 200 conditions

645
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:26,579
so it's got to start somewhere

646
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,859
yes and I think that in Europe we

647
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:31,379
actually now we have two type of

648
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:34,278
countries like first those who are

649
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,980
preparing them the regulation by

650
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:40,619
reviewing all existing data so from last

651
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,019
year so clinical and scientific data and

652
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:45,359
then they decided with the pluri

653
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:47,579
disciplinary Committee of scientists to

654
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,699
set a few indications like France for

655
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:53,220
example they said this five indication

656
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:55,679
and for this pilot project we know in

657
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,120
Portugal there's seven indication and we

658
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,220
have this simplified marketing

659
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,899
authorization submission but it's also

660
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,298
for only for this specific seven

661
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,100
indications and then in parallel we have

662
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,980
these countries like Germany and Poland

663
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:11,038
with no limit of indication only the

664
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,620
knowledge or Convention of of a doctor

665
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,298
again I'm sorry I'm back to example from

666
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,759
Poland because I was practicing this

667
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:21,079
country for four years but I remember I

668
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:24,359
made a very very young motivated

669
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,980
medical doctor his specialization I

670
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,678
think was

671
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,919
uh general medicine and then he was

672
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,519
doing the PHD in medical cannabis and he

673
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,038
started just discovering using

674
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,019
prescribing the the Cannabis and he told

675
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:45,230
me that he had a group of

676
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:47,298
um six or seven a woman with very severe

677
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:50,519
[Music]

678
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:53,119
pain you know

679
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,038
what is the pain of the day

680
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:59,038
menstrual pain period pains

681
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:00,720
migrants I'm sorry yes it's a very

682
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,900
severe and migrant and one of the

683
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,819
patients was so it was so difficult for

684
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,778
her to manage this pain that she she

685
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:12,720
planned twice to commit suicide so and

686
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:14,220
so she was really desperate and and she

687
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,558
started to have this prescription of

688
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:20,819
this purified extract for Vaping so 85

689
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:23,519
percent THC and she she said obviously

690
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:26,038
that it changed her life but on on the

691
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,679
on the scale of pain on pain it still

692
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,658
was like two but she could function so

693
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,538
so then he was motivated and he said

694
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:35,520
okay I saw it's working so I started to

695
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:37,980
um to have a group of these women

696
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,440
between 40 50 having this uh these

697
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,659
severe migrants and and he was convinced

698
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,360
because he was just uh close to this

699
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,220
patient and and he even said like okay I

700
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,339
would like to start observation study in

701
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:53,339
my hospital to maybe produce some some

702
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:55,379
scientific data so so observation is

703
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:57,839
Studies by the way it's it's very good

704
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,880
tool to have there to generate this real

705
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,859
life data we'd pay from patients on

706
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,840
under control condition and maybe not

707
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:05,339
going directly to the full clinical

708
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,619
studies which is obviously time

709
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:10,079
consuming and money consuming but but

710
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,418
again it's it's enough to have one and

711
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,639
two a few doctors which are specialized

712
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,799
in specific domain and they are very

713
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,200
motivated close to the patient with a

714
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,538
lot of empathy and then I think we can

715
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,159
generate a lot of information from

716
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:25,079
patients fantastic could you both

717
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,059
mentioned the French trial quite a few

718
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,678
times do you think any of the data

719
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:31,139
collection from the French trials will

720
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,679
be useful for other markets

721
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,299
of course I mean I love that the French

722
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,038
government are collecting this data and

723
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,418
we really hope that they do something

724
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:40,919
with that

725
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,480
um you would expect a report to be

726
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,038
published on the efficacy or

727
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,079
particularly the safety sorry in that

728
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,980
particular trial so we hope that they

729
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,099
will

730
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,558
um but in if they don't then I know we

731
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:55,500
as a company supplying into that trial

732
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,359
collect our own uh pharmacovigilance

733
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,179
data and that's going to be really

734
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,099
important as we continue to build you

735
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,720
know on that data Gathering so yeah

736
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,699
let's hope that France come out because

737
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,440
I think that could be a turning point

738
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,679
for other countries as well

739
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,720
yes I will add also that here a French

740
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,179
pilot project it's not clinical trial

741
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,480
okay it's it's really the purpose was to

742
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:22,679
to have uh to check uh kind of supply

743
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,798
chain uh how it can be controlled from

744
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,740
from yeah manufacturer this through the

745
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:32,278
distributor to the patient so it's a

746
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,859
trial a lot of learnings I think first a

747
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:37,380
report was published already after two

748
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:39,778
years and and as little you said

749
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,059
something new which is not existing in

750
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,220
any other European countries

751
00:29:41,058 --> 00:29:46,259
pharmacovigilance so it's also like a

752
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,140
kind of hybrid through the Audra Alex

753
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:52,259
website Etc but every month every

754
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:55,860
company participating in this trial are

755
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:58,679
receiving the the report of the of the

756
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:00,898
of the complaints of the patient some

757
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,538
sometimes these are very light cases

758
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:07,379
sometimes it's severe cases but we have

759
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:10,440
uh statistics and we can see it and and

760
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:14,278
by the end they will generate kind of a

761
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,399
report for information lack of efficacy

762
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:19,339
is also a side effect we can say and and

763
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,139
this is what I was mentioning about

764
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:24,418
doctors who started to to treat the pain

765
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,500
with the high CBD product the first year

766
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:32,640
so we lost a lot of patience because of

767
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,679
this lack of knowledge or maybe yes yes

768
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,100
lack of experience but then we practice

769
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,080
we could improve this data in France I'm

770
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:43,439
sure and and this is why it was also

771
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,538
this extension of why one year for this

772
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,720
pilot project big deception for the

773
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:51,419
patient obviously but I think that it

774
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,159
will allow help authorities but also all

775
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:56,159
the institutions who are implementing

776
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,419
regulation to to use this data to maybe

777
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:03,559
not only use that digest and and take

778
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:07,020
some learnings to implement the solid

779
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:10,038
real not only because this is what I was

780
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:13,740
mentioning about over regulation like

781
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:15,839
realistic regulation to help a patients

782
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,720
have a high quality product but in the

783
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,240
easy way not too complicated way

784
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,620
fantastic I think it's been so great to

785
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,899
hear um and I'm sure everyone in the

786
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,158
audience agrees the detail from the

787
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:28,079
different markets and how much we

788
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,580
actually do have to learn from what's

789
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,558
Happening we're not doing all this in a

790
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,960
kind of microcosm country by country and

791
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,119
there's so much globally to learn

792
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,798
um as as a result of that I'd love to

793
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:40,019
kind of open up to the audience and see

794
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:41,579
if there are any burning questions key

795
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,918
thoughts anyone wants to raise as we've

796
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,500
got such an international uh panel of

797
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,140
amazing women and Alex as well uh here

798
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,058
with us today and Alex as well let's

799
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,440
hear for all these amazing women and

800
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:55,879
Alex as well

801
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,880
this man right here has a question

802
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,679
[Applause]

803
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,619
yeah hi yeah so uh coming back to

804
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,659
education because I know in Denmark well

805
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,579
fleeta you were saying in Australia part

806
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,840
of the success has been the fact that

807
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:11,278
doctors have been educated maybe

808
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,359
patients have been educated and I think

809
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,278
in Europe that's still a huge problem

810
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,558
because a lot of patients don't actually

811
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,240
know that they have access to cannabis a

812
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,859
lot of doctors you know they don't

813
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,960
they're a bit scared of prescribing it

814
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:24,240
most Europeans in theory have access to

815
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,399
cannabis but you know they don't in

816
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,200
reality I know in Denmark the Danish

817
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,079
government are also trying to you know

818
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,278
Implement uh events and conferences to

819
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,379
kind of bring you know people like

820
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:37,140
yourselves doctors and patients together

821
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,700
to sort of implement it but what can the

822
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,620
rest of Europe do because Alex you said

823
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,058
you had to almost take it you know take

824
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,459
control yourself and create these

825
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:46,259
cannabis clinics I mean how do you move

826
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,460
that conversation forward and try and

827
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:53,220
get medical cannabis out to the masses

828
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,140
well you know one one thing that I think

829
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,460
is really important and I didn't want to

830
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,720
touch on earlier because I wanted to get

831
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,460
to questions but I mean since you

832
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,960
brought it up I think something that was

833
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,000
really important is for people to be

834
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,319
honest with their doctors what we had in

835
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Canada just like everywhere else there

836
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,619
was such a stigma where people who were

837
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,819
using cannabis were not telling their

838
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,778
doctors to use cannabis because they

839
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:11,519
were worried what they were going to

840
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:13,558
think and then when we started teaching

841
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,879
the doctors we said you know talk to

842
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,980
your patients about it be honest and

843
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,419
they were blown away that the patients

844
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,460
once they felt more comfortable talking

845
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:21,659
to their doctor that their doctor knew

846
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,220
something about this then they were

847
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,720
opening up and the doctors would say

848
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,700
holy cow I didn't realize how many of my

849
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,919
patients are using cannabis once I was

850
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,880
started to be like hey it's okay I'm not

851
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,500
asking you because I want to kick you

852
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,320
out of my clinic I'm asking you because

853
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,700
I'm interested and all of a sudden that

854
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,019
all changed and people were being honest

855
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,100
with them and then they were like oh

856
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,440
wait a minute more of my patients are

857
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,240
using cannabis maybe I'll talk to them

858
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,980
about it because the reality is cannabis

859
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,839
is so readily available pretty much

860
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,360
everywhere in the world like everywhere

861
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,879
we go people use cannabis it's easy to

862
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,319
get so I think once doctors realize that

863
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,240
that the patient are you going to use

864
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,500
cannabis whether they like it or not and

865
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,720
now they should have a harm reduction

866
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,398
approach and maybe we should talk to

867
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,980
them about maybe not smoking it or using

868
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:03,538
CBD or not such high THC then we can

869
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,339
have real conversations and I think that

870
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:07,140
is a big game changer that I would like

871
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:09,659
to share with people is be honest with

872
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,940
your doctor and if the doctor is hating

873
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,440
on cannabis maybe you should find a

874
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,179
different doctor there are open-minded

875
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,820
doctors out there

876
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,878
it is such a patient-driven industry you

877
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,800
know and our doctors do from patients

878
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,739
they don't

879
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,320
and are open and willing to learn about

880
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:30,059
prescribing cannabis medicines they

881
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,280
potentially lose patience

882
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,320
and the patients move on and that's

883
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,419
where you start to get these clinics and

884
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,820
other specialized doctors or authorized

885
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:41,158
prescribers in the space because they

886
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,440
are willing and open and

887
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,358
there are channels you know whereby

888
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,240
patients can access and know who to

889
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,519
access just in terms of who prescribes

890
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,500
more often than not so you know patients

891
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,780
have got a huge voice but it doesn't

892
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,780
take away from the fact cannabis

893
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,760
producers just like pharmaceutical

894
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,339
companies have got a role to play and we

895
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,580
need people on the ground educating and

896
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:07,139
we need to be continuing our webinars

897
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:08,699
whether that's sending out faxes to

898
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,578
doctor clinics because believe it or not

899
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,618
that's still happening and as well as

900
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:16,019
other strategies to bring doctors

901
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:19,320
together to educate

902
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:20,699
great thank you uh I think we have one

903
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,079
question up here one question very

904
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:23,279
quickly please because we're running off

905
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,660
time you've all talked a lot about

906
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,660
concentrates but you haven't really

907
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:28,858
mentioned anything about pills or about

908
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:30,960
ingestibles Edibles that kind of thing

909
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:34,500
is there is there any market for that in

910
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,480
Europe today and uh if if not yet in THC

911
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,659
what about CBD

912
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,119
so yes all the garlic formats are

913
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:44,098
possible but obviously we have to submit

914
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,599
full marketing authorization to the

915
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:50,880
country which is ready to obtain such a

916
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,640
submission So currently it's Portugal

917
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,400
very ready from few years I think three

918
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,219
four years very explicit and detailed

919
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,680
regulation

920
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:03,539
but currently nobody achieved to have

921
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,519
marketing authorization we have only one

922
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:10,199
approved flower in Portugal and so

923
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,239
still I think there is the path and this

924
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,799
is like confirmed from Magister

925
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:19,259
formulation so this is why the the

926
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,180
proactive Innovative page pharmacies

927
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,339
which I see that are sitting there for

928
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:26,940
example having the big Magister

929
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:28,980
formulation and the labs in their in

930
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,960
their Pharmacy if they have a knowledge

931
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,519
of formulation if they have a

932
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,858
prescription for the doctor for example

933
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,679
for the tablets with CBD or TC they're

934
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:39,598
able to do but there is the also the

935
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,539
financial aspect in the reimbursement

936
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,980
like for example in Germany because I

937
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,380
don't think that the pharmacist will

938
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,539
spend their time in doing these tablets

939
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,160
or any other Edibles in the in the

940
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:53,400
Pharmacy in the Magister formulation

941
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:56,098
only to help the patient so I think this

942
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,858
is more a complex project the problem

943
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:00,900
not only from from form formulation from

944
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:02,940
visibility because this is possible if

945
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,160
the doctor is prescribing the tablet for

946
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,740
example we I don't know 50

947
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:10,078
um a milligram CBD 50 milligrams THC it

948
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:12,358
can be manufacturing by pharmacies in

949
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,880
the pharmacy in Germany also in Poland

950
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,799
yeah but but I think there is the the

951
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,599
problem of the of the time on the

952
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,800
reimbursement also of the pricing of

953
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,660
this product

954
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,000
yeah there are there are some available

955
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:26,279
there are soft gel caps in the market

956
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,358
and I think again it's a patient driven

957
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,220
thing

958
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,920
um perhaps it's what's the content and

959
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:33,539
and what is inside the capsule that's

960
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,099
probably the issue at the moment and not

961
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:36,480
getting the results but the patients

962
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:38,400
just don't seem don't seem to be

963
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,460
demanding that right now but I think as

964
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,700
you find as will as the medicinal regime

965
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,880
progresses and more doctors start

966
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,838
prescribing they will want these options

967
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,820
but they do need to go through

968
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,440
registration processes as well and

969
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,880
earlier in the beginning of the talk we

970
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,838
touched on it we didn't touch it on it

971
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,940
too much because there's not really any

972
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:59,039
regulations for it but truthfully these

973
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,800
products are amazing we see a lot of

974
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,139
Edibles beverages extracts being used by

975
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,359
medicine reduces stigma doesn't have the

976
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:08,098
smell uh you know one thing I want to

977
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:10,319
point out about this is that you're only

978
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,760
letting the illicit Market win by not

979
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,559
having these products what we had in

980
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,480
Canada is every product that wasn't

981
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,578
legalized was what the illicit Market

982
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,380
was celebrating and now the only

983
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,839
negative we kind of are left with is a

984
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,000
10mm maximum per package which is

985
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,679
extremely wasteful and stupid so now the

986
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,480
listen Mark is pretty much holding on to

987
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,399
100 milligram a thousand milligram

988
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,960
Edibles outside of that there's almost

989
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,019
no reason to go to the listed Market

990
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,300
anymore and we'll I predicted two years

991
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:38,338
ago by 2025 we aren't even going to have

992
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,440
an illicit market so you know this is

993
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:42,059
what the future holds for everyone else

994
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,559
