2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:16,170
well ICBC is all business right here

3
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:21,269
it's about networking and organizing a

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:24,118
complete new market this is a group of

5
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,679
potential entrepreneurs money is going

6
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,009
to be involved very very quickly

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,589
probably a good many of them are going

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,649
to do very well financially from

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,750
cannabis legal for for medical use and

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,789
eventually for recreational use here in

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,269
Germany it's very exciting to see such a

12
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:44,850
large market open up for cannabis

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,239
especially you know really leading the

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,359
way for the rest of the EU this is

15
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,578
global this is prohibition coming off

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,289
it's exciting to be the cusp of a new

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,719
exciting industry if you look around

18
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,489
here everyone's excited to be here you

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,198
know so it's it's very exciting to be a

20
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:03,058
part of that and to help educate people

21
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,280
about us and about the industry and

22
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,798
about where we see it going my idea that

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,750
we have a totally different approach to

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,530
addiction in general not only cannabis

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,368
that we really see it as an illness and

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,868
not something criminal and very

27
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:22,079
optimistic that we get this in five or

28
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:24,629
ten years I think the key to this is

29
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,478
just to try and do keep people try to

30
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,759
get experts from countries where this

31
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,429
has already been on the market for years

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,810
for example we are quite new to the

33
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,420
cannabis scene and for us it's a great

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,460
way to connect with people and to find

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,109
new business opportunities because the

36
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,589
scene is growing and growing but still

37
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,599
quite small and

38
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,210
just a great way to get to know everyone

39
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,928

40
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,000
whenever I speak at one of these

41
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,879
conferences I begged these people when

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,670
they open their shop to be encyclopedias

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,618
of information on cannabis the nice

44
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,750
little old lady comes in from the

45
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,879
grocery shopping into the cannabis shop

46
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,438
her hands hurt she could no longer knit

47
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,599
here's a brochure

48
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,608
about what a cannabinoid could do for

49
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,879
your arthritis if you want to explore

50
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:10,650
that more come back and see us
