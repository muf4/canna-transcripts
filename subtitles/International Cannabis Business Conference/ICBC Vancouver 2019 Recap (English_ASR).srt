00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,550
which we've been really delightful to be

3
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,119
at this ICBC show in Vancouver is the

4
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,039
vibe has been so business oriented but

5
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:40,049
also friendly and creative and the

6
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,379
content that the talks has been really

7
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,058
good it's been an elevated version from

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,429
a lot of other events that I've been to

9
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,829
I've really enjoyed that we exhibited as

10
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,600
well and the conversations that we have

11
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,549
had who have been the same on a business

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,550
level so it's been it's been really nice

13
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,519
this is Joshua green cross we traveled

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,829
up here from Texas for the education for

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,079
the networking to be a part of a

16
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,969
community that's very special and dear

17
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,679
to our hearts but we do take all this

18
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,679
knowledge back to Texas and try to

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,390
spread as much of it as we can sprinkle

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,430
it in throughout our retail process

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,120
Vancouver is definitely one for the

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,649
books
