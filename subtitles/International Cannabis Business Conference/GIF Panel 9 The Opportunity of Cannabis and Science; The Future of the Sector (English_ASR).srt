1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:14,580
thanks everybody uh I uh well doing the

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,718
science panel of what I will do uh since

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,760
we're not going to moderate this one

4
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,919
either I'm going to have these guys

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,679
introduced my steam colleagues in their

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,960
background science and we'll jump into a

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,939
question or two and then kick it out to

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,179
you guys on where these guys think it's

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,579
going uh Geo do you want to start

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,640
yeah sure thank you hi everybody again

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,340
so I'm Giovanni venturini so

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,420
um yeah I've been working in the bio

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,280
refining space since uh at least 15 15

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,120
years

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,020
um

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,179
after after graduating in engineering I

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,840
started to work on second generation

18
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,659
biofuels in in Africa from non-food

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,320
crops then I

20
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:04,439
I moved to the biomaterials where I

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,459
started a company called agroots and

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,798
that company is producing a bio glues

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,780
bioresins

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,020
for replacing formaldehyde in wood

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,840
paneling in Wood panel

26
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:21,478
production so and that's where

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,520
I actually I learned first time about

28
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,920
about the

29
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,099
um hemp because I was looking for a

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,939
protein sources to be used in the bio

31
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:36,599
resin formulation and uh then I

32
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:40,758
I I started a second company dedicated

33
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:44,578
to to cannabis and hemp in 2018

34
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,560
that's herbalea and we are specialized

35
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,139
in

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,000
solventless extraction we develop a

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,060
number of Technologies for obtaining

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,060
concentrate vape liquids with different

39
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,700
cannabinoids terpenes fraction starting

40
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,439
from fresh fresh material

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,439
and and what's your educational

42
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,780
background yeah I was saying so I study

43
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,780
in the Industrial Engineer in University

44
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:18,060
of Florence then I spent a year at the

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:20,878
kotehoa in Stockholm in Sweden and a lot

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,239
of experience on the ground I just want

47
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,479
to mention perhaps that had a as a

48
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,030
mentor a biotechnologist there was the

49
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,299
first uh inventor at Genentech

50
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,878
[Music]

51
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,640
a few years ago and I learned a lot from

52
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,939
from him is Professor Roberto Crea and

53
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,299
uh yeah I mean now I have like eight

54
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,859
between pattern and pattern applications

55
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,140
what's up

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,959
yeah so I started my career at Imperial

57
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,919
College as an academic drug developer

58
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,080
developed a number of targeted

59
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,299
biological therapies and spanout patents

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,760
that ended up in becoming biotech

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,800
companies then spent a period of time at

62
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,598
Harvard Medical School doing similar

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,640
types of research at which point I

64
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,699
pivoted my career into technology

65
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:11,219
technological entrepreneurship and then

66
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,859
spent the last 15 years in that sort of

67
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:16,219
vein eventually bringing myself back

68
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,780
actually to

69
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:21,239
cannabinoids primarily because what I

70
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,818
saw was an industry that really had a

71
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,459
deep need to be able to address complex

72
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:29,399
questions and the best process we have

73
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,840
today for that is called science and so

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,340
from that point of view I saw a real

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,319
opportunity with the way that things had

76
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,060
been scheduled and also therefore grants

77
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,339
had been blocked universities couldn't

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,620
do the research that was required that

79
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,098
we could create a an Innovative company

80
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,080
that could actually address or build a

81
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,060
platform and an innovation investment

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,780
system to be able to develop that early

83
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,759
stage research and capitalize upon it

84
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,919
my personal interest there really comes

85
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,780
from the fact that as a as a drug

86
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,399
developer in my early career it felt

87
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,878
like we were developing drugs that

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,879
blunted and kind of dampened the issue

89
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,139
rather than found real cures and

90
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,579
cannabinoids were interesting to me for

91
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,958
a long time primarily because they still

92
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,019
didn't teach them they still don't teach

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,878
them in medical school but they interact

94
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,139
in a fundamentally interesting way in

95
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,599
the fact that they interact with the

96
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,579
brain the neurological system and with

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,620
the immunological system and it gives

98
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,680
you an incredibly new way to think about

99
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,540
how you might cure diseases that are

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,579
more on the lines of complex chronic

101
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,139
Community non-communicable diseases my

102
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,120
background

103
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,819
I've got a BSC in Biochemistry and

104
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,800
genetics PhD in molecular biology and

105
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,879
biochemistry in an MBA

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,879
thanks Eric

107
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:47,939
let's see this is working here okay so

108
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,939
um I first became familiar with uh

109
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,918
cannabinoids in the 1980s I think in the

110
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,740
early 80s in the latter part of the 80s

111
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,439
and I'd uh been a member of the American

112
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,160
Chemical Society for I think over 23

113
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:05,399
years now most my most recent experi

114
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,080
experience with cannabinoids began in

115
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:12,359
2019 I was at the University of tubingen

116
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,659
at The Institute of organic chemistry

117
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,180
there and they had a vaping crisis in

118
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,840
the United States and people from the

119
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,860
United States had contacted me and asked

120
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,918
me what we could do as far as finding a

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:33,180
safe diluence for a THC that was going

122
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:35,459
into these vaping carts and so uh you

123
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,519
know I I studied a little bit about the

124
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:41,579
problem which was lipoid pneumonia at

125
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,279
the time and we began the looking into

126
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:47,159
this a little bit but one day as I was

127
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,859
looking at compounds we pulled into the

128
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,960
parking lot of the university and I

129
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,419
looked at the structure of CBD and then

130
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:58,198
I looked at the structure of THC and I

131
00:05:54,418 --> 00:06:01,918
said wow these compounds are so similar

132
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:07,139
it would be very easy to um you know

133
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,758
cycle size CBD into uh into THC I I I

134
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,560
don't know I maybe they were doing this

135
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,879
in the United States at the time we

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,319
looked and we found in the patent

137
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,360
literature that other people had done

138
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,879
this previously but we thought well we

139
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,400
could make a nice uh solid supported uh

140
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:23,339
Catalyst for doing this and perhaps sell

141
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,859
it to licensed companies in the United

142
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,318
States and that was our our first

143
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,060
business model we we did that and then

144
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,660
we began

145
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,519
um

146
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:38,400
making uh derivatives of uh CBD Pro

147
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,279
drugs and THC which were water-soluble

148
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,620
and had increased bioavailability and so

149
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,638
uh basically I would say since that time

150
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,500
we've been focused on making

151
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,379
modifications to cannabinoids and novel

152
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,860
cannabinoids and lately I've been

153
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:59,759
directed toward the recreational markets

154
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,600
here in Europe and also in the United

155
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,259
States so that's uh that's primarily the

156
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,060
focus of tresco labs which as I said

157
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,740
interior educational background

158
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,280
educational background yeah my

159
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,780
educational background is a Bachelor of

160
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:23,698
Science degree so I'm not

161
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:26,279
as is uh decorated as decorated it's

162
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,699
decorated yes as Sebastian is and who

163
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,258
provides such a very uh articulate uh

164
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,478
answers to many of the questions we have

165
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,520
to say I am quite quite proud of you uh

166
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,918
for that Sebastian but I do have a lot

167
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,839
of uh experience in organic synthesis

168
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,659
over the years and that's that's

169
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,638
primarily what I'm uh focused on but I I

170
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,639
have just like Giovanni I have spent

171
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,680
time at uh Genentech where they teach us

172
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:55,740
that the process is the product yeah

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,720
so so so there's a reason why I put this

174
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,120
panel together so essentially Eric is

175
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,099
working out of Frankfurt you have Geo

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,079
working out of Florence and you have

177
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:07,139
said you're working out of uh north of

178
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,719
London south of London but yeah sorry

179
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,079
yeah I had that 50 50.

180
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,139
uh but so essentially Eric it kind of

181
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,339
does the the molecular side uh seb's

182
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,439
looking at the business and then

183
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,359
certainly Geo's looking and has

184
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,959
Technologies as far as separations or

185
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,720
inclusions so I guess starting with UGL

186
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,899
what is uh what are a few of the things

187
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,719
three two three things that you see uh

188
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:36,658
most exciting on the near-term horizon

189
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,820
whether it's 12 months 18 months that's

190
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:40,799
going to make the most impact what we're

191
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,899
talking about cannabis cannabinoids or

192
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:47,519
something in between

193
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:49,259
okay thank you so I I think that also

194
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,560
from the questions that I raised to the

195
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:55,080
previous panels I think that

196
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,000
here we are assisting to a bit of

197
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,639
dichotomy between of course the European

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,419
market or rest of the world and the us

199
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:07,799
where the US is a let's say an open lab

200
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:10,799
for experimenting uh what what is uh

201
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,599
what is interesting from from a consumer

202
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,039
perspective more than a patient's

203
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,800
perspective

204
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:20,699
so I think that uh

205
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:23,458
um if we go if we look at what will be

206
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,700
the development of the European sector

207
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:29,039
um maybe in a bit more than one year if

208
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,040
some recreational market for instance is

209
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:35,159
going to be to to open also also also in

210
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:38,338
Germany uh I think that

211
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,319
the importance of understanding what the

212
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,320
consumer not only the patient but also

213
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,019
the consumer that and I say patient and

214
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,480
consumer with with and we mentioned

215
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,379
today that is the the separation between

216
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,420
these two concepts is uh is sometimes

217
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:57,958
not easy to to make but what really the

218
00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:00,979
consumer wants is is important so my

219
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:04,139
point is that for instance when I was

220
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,899
studying a bit the sector I went to to a

221
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,600
pharmacist and um

222
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,639
and I was looking at the way they were

223
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,019
producing the tincture

224
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,740
they cannabino tincture the boiling the

225
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:22,200
dry flour in in oil

226
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,919
they were obtaining a tincture there was

227
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,120
like smelling of rotten fish and I asked

228
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,120
but

229
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,100
so it smelled bad I mean and I don't

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,720
think this is we like and the answer by

231
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,300
the pharmacist was but that's a medicine

232
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,339
so it doesn't have to to taste nice or

233
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,199
whatever so that's that was the

234
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,540
mentality that I

235
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,899
that I found at least in Italy three

236
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:48,659
three four years ago and uh it hasn't

237
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,120
changed so much in in Italy at least so

238
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:54,120
I think that what is what is important

239
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,399
to understand is that the the quality

240
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,399
and and having product that really meet

241
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,919
the expectation by by the consumer and

242
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,759
and and can be good for them and they

243
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,159
can be

244
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,379
Pleasant is also very important also in

245
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,059
the medical sector so in that regard I

246
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,100
think that

247
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:14,278
for instance what we are doing with some

248
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:17,399
Partners in California we are developing

249
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:21,120
this solventless product which in my

250
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,159
view represent what is what the market

251
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,019
is is demanding from for many for many

252
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:29,519
for many reasons because you know it's

253
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:33,600
it meets a lot of ESG let's say uh

254
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,000
um point on on the way that

255
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,259
the consumer can can can understand that

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,419
there is no you know that is not um

257
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:44,159
let's say organic solvent be used being

258
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,759
used in the in in the production process

259
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:50,278
and um and and for instance in a product

260
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,139
that he has to inhale that's something

261
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:55,320
that

262
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:58,139
um the consumer is is growing a

263
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,760
Consciousness on what is inhaling and

264
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,458
that's very very important

265
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,419
so I think let's say

266
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:09,059
the obtaining products that can be of

267
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,559
high quality and can meet the consumer

268
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,619
expectations

269
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,359
now and the future expectation I think

270
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,120
it's very very important

271
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,300
thank you sir

272
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,519
yeah so I think the most exciting thing

273
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,899
in the next two years firstly I want to

274
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,778
say that science time is a bit like

275
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,539
geological time it runs way slower than

276
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,399
investors or maybe cannabis cultivators

277
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,219
would like it to but that's the nature

278
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,179
of the Beast so our I can tell you what

279
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,399
we're working on that we're

280
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:42,059
fundamentally excited about and that is

281
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,519
a platform for utilizing data science to

282
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:48,899
surface and develop pipelines of

283
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,959
biopharmaceutical drugs now historically

284
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,879
there are we've been focused on THC and

285
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,679
CBD fundamentally and most people in the

286
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,299
room today are focused primarily in

287
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,699
their knowledge based on those two

288
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,979
molecules there's a hundred cannabinoids

289
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,139
the 23 000 terpenes there's 10 000

290
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,579
flavonoids out there some of those you

291
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,139
can get to in high abundance in the

292
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,019
plants some of them you can't

293
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:12,060
however what we lack in this industry is

294
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,459
the ability to connect the market with

295
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,919
the production and that is fundamentally

296
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,899
a question of function in the human body

297
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,299
which we don't yet have a good answer to

298
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,519
so what I'm fundamentally excited about

299
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:24,419
over the next two years is the data

300
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,879
science that we're doing around

301
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:30,120
correlating Plant production or Natural

302
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,039
Abundance with known data in the in the

303
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,419
literature primarily scientific

304
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,578
literature and our own that we're

305
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:38,159
generating in our labs and then

306
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:40,620
developing concepts of how we might

307
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,899
think about disease not in the Cartesian

308
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,360
model of Alzheimer's cancer so on and so

309
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,179
forth but in what are the core

310
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,278
common features of those diseases like

311
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,778
dysregulated inflammation and so on and

312
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,399
so forth so that we're designing

313
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,559
clinical trials that actually have

314
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,600
relevant endpoints for cannabinoid-based

315
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,578
medicines or molecules that may be

316
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,778
coming out of that same plant because if

317
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:03,659
you look at the data I think there's

318
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,578
something like 400 trials only 40 of

319
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,838
them have reported that means the rest

320
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,939
of them are basically flunked and

321
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,940
they've not even bothered of those I

322
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,339
think 20 are around sort of successful

323
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,899
and most of those are based on CBD so

324
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,399
we're only just scratching the surface

325
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,539
of what could be a trillion dollar

326
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,519
market

327
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,139
in the future but we've got to go and do

328
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,120
the leg work to get there so that's what

329
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,399
I'm really excited about David thanks

330
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,278
herb Eric

331
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,740
well what I'm excited about is I speak

332
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:35,220
to people on a daily basis who in the

333
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,980
United States and in Europe move metric

334
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,339
tons of cannabinoids into the

335
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,920
marketplace and so I hear from them uh

336
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:48,000
every day and every week what's going on

337
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:51,719
uh in the industry worldwide

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,519
and it's a very it's a very volatile

339
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,800
industry but

340
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,778
I think personally that what we're going

341
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,120
to see and a thing that I'm very excited

342
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:03,620
about and what we're working on is

343
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,078
having materials that are

344
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,720
non-psychoactive that consumers can

345
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,419
easily access

346
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,560
but that they can have tools in place to

347
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:18,360
be able to modify these

348
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,838
non-psychoactive completely unregulated

349
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,879
compounds if they want to

350
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,579
into

351
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:30,240
compounds that are say for example CB1

352
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:32,219
receptor agonists which are greatly in

353
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,399
demand you know in the United States and

354
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,579
in Europe and in other markets so I see

355
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,419
this really is is the way forward and

356
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:45,719
also as the way forward for

357
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:48,899
marketers is being able to put tools in

358
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:53,278
the the hands of the the patients where

359
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:56,159
the patients can make a decision to if

360
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,559
they want to to produce a substance that

361
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,919
might be considered controlled in their

362
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:04,559
jurisdiction and so uh

363
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,599
this is an area that that I'm working on

364
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,799
every day and I think this is rather

365
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,740
exciting

366
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,859
uh just add probably kind of uh treading

367
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,240
the line in between everybody here uh so

368
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,919
we mentioned earlier we're a lead

369
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,879
sponsor of can Med

370
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:24,539
uh in April we were able to put on the

371
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,120
stage uh with myself some of the leading

372
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:28,620
scientists uh one of the things that was

373
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,320
really interesting that came out of that

374
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,198
is having the next killer app if you

375
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,940
will on cannabis and cannabinoids so if

376
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,979
you live in the states especially in

377
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,899
Colorado when you saw in 2012 a bunch of

378
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,300
a lot of people moving to Colorado was

379
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,759
one of the first legal states because a

380
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:47,698
lot of mothers and fathers had kids that

381
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,379
had epilepsy and the easiest access was

382
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,299
to come to Colorado as you guys know

383
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,240
mothers and fathers will do anything for

384
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:56,159
their kids and so that I think was the

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,339
first kill wrap if you will on canvas or

386
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,899
CBD and I think that's the thing that

387
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,120
we're searching for is what's the next

388
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,500
really killer app and one thing that

389
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,759
came out of can man that was really

390
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,220
interesting that came out of a

391
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,199
conversation with on stage with Teddy

392
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,959
meiery and Ethan Rousseau as they think

393
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,539
women's health is going to be one of the

394
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,000
next low-hanging fruits for cannabis and

395
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:21,359
cannabinoids the the other thing that I

396
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,359
think touching on Eric's and what Geo's

397
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,578
doing is where this molecular world is

398
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,339
going to go as far as making some of

399
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,899
these new I know Eric's said before one

400
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,899
of the main things he's selling here in

401
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,100
the uh in Europe is hhc

402
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,019
hexahydrocannabinol so a lot of these

403
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,519
miners in the production of those and

404
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,859
then actually trying to find out what

405
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,319
those do because if you guys everybody

406
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,839
knows here there's still a stigma and if

407
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,000
we can do more data get better molecules

408
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,579
more consistent high quality molecules

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,460
we're going to get rid of we're going to

410
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:55,019
definitely get rid of the stigma

411
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,700
one other question before we put it out

412
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,660
uh

413
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,298
really talking to all you guys on stage

414
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,880
innovation has not had a lot to do with

415
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:08,339
cannabis and intellectual property has

416
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,500
not had a lot to do with cannabis so

417
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,359
maybe getting two more specific points

418
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,679
Geo if you want to start off as far as

419
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,439
your thoughts on what we can do better

420
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,259
with the Innovation thank you I I think

421
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,360
that's a very interesting angle so

422
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:23,819
um you know I was

423
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,099
I've been keeping track on you know on

424
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,359
bad end but an application in the in the

425
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:31,259
canopy space

426
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:33,019
and um I think there has been a pretty

427
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,759
pretty interesting ramp up

428
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:39,599
[Music]

429
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:42,538
three four years ago uh on the on the

430
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:46,199
planet application that were filed every

431
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:48,599
every year on on on different areas so

432
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,860
it's interesting to notice by the way

433
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,740
that

434
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:55,159
one of the I mean some of the of the

435
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,538
largest uh

436
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,640
let's say some of the of the companies

437
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,558
most active in in filing pattern

438
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,900
applications on cannabinoids and

439
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,960
cannabis in general actually where we're

440
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,600
Pharma companies right so

441
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,360
but at the end let's say the their

442
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,399
commercial activity on on the field

443
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,759
that's been uh let's say with exclusion

444
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,759
of uh of GW

445
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:24,179
until until uh last year has been um

446
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:26,640
limited right so

447
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm referring to the the big big Pharma

448
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,500
companies big Pharma so despite having

449
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,839
uh some interesting uh patterns around

450
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,519
that they they were pretty

451
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,619
um Limited in the in the commercial

452
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,980
exploitation and that's something that

453
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:43,859
that puzzled a bit uh me I mean having

454
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,099
having a patent a protection but not

455
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:49,079
getting to to the market with the with

456
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,558
um with final product is something that

457
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,599
really puzzles me I think a lot

458
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,538
um I don't have I don't have an answer

459
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,359
for specific answer for that there are

460
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:03,119
some ideas I mean but uh

461
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,819
if you look at the of the statistics

462
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,579
that have been published earlier also

463
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,079
this year

464
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,418
wherever cannabis has been you know

465
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,918
legalized to a certain extent there has

466
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:17,220
been certainly um

467
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,620
a decrease in opioids consumption right

468
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,620
and um

469
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,579
so I I maybe the simple answer is that

470
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,599
you know

471
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,779
um

472
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:30,240
allowing of course a big use of of

473
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,160
cannabis in the sector would have a big

474
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,960
impact also on the sales of other of

475
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,700
other products that's maybe a very

476
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,100
simple answer I don't know if that's if

477
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,319
that's correct but but the reality

478
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,659
coming coming just to comment also the

479
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,298
previous the previous point that you

480
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,580
were making uh David on the on the

481
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:50,400
stigma I mean it's

482
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,298
I think it's really ridiculous that you

483
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,080
know

484
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:59,339
in opioids prescription is uh is done

485
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:01,199
such a light and easy manner

486
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:04,319
I mean I was

487
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,480
like personally let's say exploring a

488
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,899
bit the the opioids consumption in

489
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,380
pharmacies in in uh just in my city

490
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,360
Florence and it's simply crazy I mean we

491
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,360
I mean we're talking about really a a

492
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,399
percentage of of of of the population

493
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,759
that is consuming this consuming opioids

494
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,519
and this should be a short a short

495
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,619
period of treatment of with opioids and

496
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,538
and they want one once these people they

497
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:32,759
entered the the loop they they cannot

498
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:34,500
exit easily so it's I found really

499
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,720
ridiculous that

500
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,058
the doctors then can prescribe and

501
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,940
pharmacists can provide opioids in such

502
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:44,519
an easy Manner and um and there is still

503
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,640
a stigma on cannabis so and actually the

504
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:51,779
the the the the length of the treatment

505
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,120
of for instance in Italy is often

506
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,859
um

507
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,058
made it difficult because of the lack of

508
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:59,058
of uh

509
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,440
availability of of the products to the

510
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,480
pharmacies so it's it's really strange

511
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,740
and I hope that you know this will uh

512
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,740
will we get better

513
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,220
I got three things on IP

514
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,900
um when we started five-time Life

515
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,460
Sciences we made a very strong decision

516
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,860
not to straddle ourselves between

517
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,900
production and Manufacturing and being a

518
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,339
research company we're 100 a research

519
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,559
company focused on the development of

520
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:28,379
intellectual property the licensing of

521
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,519
it and commercialization of it I think

522
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:34,140
that's a very important thing to think

523
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:36,599
about we do not start any wet research

524
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,700
unless we've done a patent landscape

525
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,639
search which we have an intellectual

526
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,740
property office for and number three

527
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,020
fundamentally is if you're not willing

528
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,359
to defend a patent I.E you've got the

529
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:50,158
cash to do so do not go and publish

530
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:51,658
everything you know about that process

531
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,740
because someone's going to copy you and

532
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,640
you're not going to be able to defend it

533
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,099
and you're going to be able to do

534
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,600
nothing about it I hope that's clear

535
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:00,178
enough for everybody in the room what I

536
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,339
think about that

537
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,159
so you were talking about Innovation

538
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:07,619
David in the Cannabis space and I have

539
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:12,240
to say what I think is interesting is

540
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:15,599
how fast the market has responded to

541
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,179
um some key uh peer revert reviewed

542
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:23,038
papers that we had on Alka chain

543
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:25,919
derivatives of for example THC so we had

544
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,058
and these I think papers at least the

545
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,400
first one came out of an Italian

546
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:30,658
University didn't it with what they

547
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,820
called um

548
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,280
the THC

549
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:37,139
by for all or something no it wasn't

550
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,599
that that was the heptal chain the

551
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,159
heptal alkyl chain derivative so then we

552
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:45,899
began to see in the United States

553
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,220
production of thcp they called it that

554
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,720
was for the heptal alkal chain

555
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,200
derivative and then of course

556
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,880
immediately after that came the hhcp

557
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,058
which was a heptal chain derivative

558
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,820
there so many people got to know

559
00:23:56,058 --> 00:24:03,119
firsthand that these alkyl chain uh

560
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:06,079
derivatives of the classic cannabinoids

561
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,479
could provide

562
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:12,000
a more powerful effect or an equivalent

563
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,538
effect with a smaller dose and that they

564
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,839
lasted for a longer period of time so I

565
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,779
I think that the consumer base with many

566
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,779
of these products has experientially

567
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:25,339
learned how different

568
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,178
modifications

569
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:33,119
to these molecules are capable of

570
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:35,820
influencing the the perceived

571
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,479
central nervous system effect yeah so

572
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:42,119
that's one Innovation I've seen so well

573
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,679
real quick there was a a client of ours

574
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,699
and he'll be telling a little later on

575
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,220
who produced some thcp and he said he

576
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,080
took it and he was high for three days

577
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,140
so it's uh it's fun it's called fun with

578
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,579
chemistry no one thing real quick and

579
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,720
then I'll kick it over you guys then we

580
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,759
can kick it to the audience one thing

581
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,558
about intellectual property in the IP is

582
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,960
if you really knew the GW Pharma Jazz

583
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,940
deal that was really done it wasn't done

584
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,179
really on epidiolex it was done on the

585
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,558
IP that GW Pharma had so and that's the

586
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,120
biggest deal that's really ever been

587
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,099
done in the sector and really if you

588
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,619
look at GW it's it's more of a biotech

589
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:19,259
company than a cannabis but the the

590
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,359
importance of IEP and Innovation is only

591
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:25,140
going to grow in the sector for sure

592
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:28,558
yeah I think I think just to to connect

593
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,740
to the point of Sebastian so

594
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,440
we opened the our you know industrial

595
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,220
lab in in Los Angeles from Florence

596
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,740
um

597
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,000
at the end of last year and we started

598
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,620
to interact a lot with California

599
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,278
companies and I think it's very

600
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:46,879
interesting to notice few few things

601
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:50,339
one is that the

602
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,799
many producers they they they try to

603
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,439
just to stay secret about what they are

604
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,658
doing in terms of

605
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,860
the process their formulation because

606
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:05,340
Sebastian was saying I mean it's not

607
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:07,979
easy to fall apart and and and remain

608
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:10,019
protected and fight fight for that and I

609
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,620
and I I know at least a couple of cases

610
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:15,179
where actually there has been a file a

611
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:19,019
pattern that has been filed for instance

612
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:22,798
one is in the production of uh uh thca

613
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:26,038
diamonds okay and uh and the company was

614
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:28,798
a small company and uh many others they

615
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:31,200
started to copy to copy the process and

616
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,480
in the end he couldn't do anything else

617
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,940
that you know being acquired by one of

618
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,120
the companies that was copying their

619
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,220
method and uh and agree with uh you know

620
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,979
with their royalty whatever but it has

621
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,740
been a clear defeat okay on that regard

622
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,980
and also the is interesting the the the

623
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:53,579
case of uh of um

624
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:57,419
GW and and canopy and there has been a

625
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:59,939
an IP you know low suite and and uh

626
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:03,179
probably the the the end of the lawsuit

627
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:06,600
was a bit unexpected uh perhaps in in

628
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:10,200
the US and uh and therefore it is is

629
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,839
certainly a double a double-edged sword

630
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,960
the the IP protection I mean on our on

631
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:18,178
our end we we believe that

632
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,400
but in protection and Innovation pattern

633
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,600
protection is is important so we we we

634
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,440
find

635
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,579
uh five different uh patent families and

636
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,778
most of them they have been already

637
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:33,079
granted so because because our model is

638
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:36,298
also based on licensing this technology

639
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:39,000
but of course as always and every as in

640
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:41,158
every sector filing a pattern is not

641
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,038
sufficient you have to protect by

642
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,260
executing through the execution and and

643
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:47,759
deliver you know the best service or the

644
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:50,519
best product on the market in any case

645
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,099
so the IP protection IP protection I

646
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,700
believe is just a plus so

647
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:58,558
anything else no nothing to add on that

648
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,259
so we'll go

649
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,399
uh and guy we can put it out to the

650
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:07,158
audience for

651
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,159
for any questions we may have

652
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,240
um honestly uh it was hard for me even

653
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,759
to take notes because things that you

654
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,038
folks seem to assume

655
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,140
um

656
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:25,859
is so far over my head

657
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,299
um

658
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:34,459
but um in the United States recently as

659
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:38,700
you know the DEA has granted licenses

660
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,319
to a number of cannabis cultivators who

661
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,919
are meant to supply

662
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:47,278
product and competition with a much

663
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,900
maligned University of Mississippi

664
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,778
and

665
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:55,140
I am curious uh

666
00:28:51,778 --> 00:29:00,000
in if you anyone on the panel has a

667
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:02,038
sense of how those business models what

668
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,759
kind of business models might develop by

669
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:09,119
having a well-funded DEA approved

670
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:14,099
presumably well regulated new suppliers

671
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:16,439
of of cannabis and cannabinoids into the

672
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:18,959
research space and into farm and into

673
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,840
Pharma like is this is this a big deal

674
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,000
or is it just

675
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,038
um TBC

676
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,960
Joe Montana

677
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:30,179
uh it is a big deal because it shows

678
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,100
intent federally that they want to

679
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,080
develop research and that possibly then

680
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:35,639
opens up grant funding In America which

681
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,798
is still the biggest grant funding

682
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,179
capability in the world so from a

683
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:41,940
research perspective I think is

684
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:44,399
fantastic news and basically Mississippi

685
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,159
cannabis was dust that was off the floor

686
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,918
I think in Mississippi somewhere so

687
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,440
fantastic on that front in terms of

688
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,080
really getting to the molecular level of

689
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,960
the issue I think it provides a generic

690
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:59,939
starting point for questions that are

691
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,000
molecular questions not necessarily

692
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,340
biomass or whole flower questions and so

693
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,099
it therefore has a certain limited

694
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,959
potential if it's just one strain of

695
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:13,319
cannabis grown to order through a

696
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,298
certain federally licensed site we are

697
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,220
much more excited about

698
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:19,558
organizations that can grow small

699
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,480
batches of material where you can still

700
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,099
do pilot studies but they're

701
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,778
fundamentally thinking about the

702
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:27,898
chemistry and the variable chemistry

703
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:30,538
possibly in polychemical format not down

704
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:32,158
to THC CBD but maybe it's Unique land

705
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:34,259
race strains or other things that are

706
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,080
producing really interesting things that

707
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,359
we don't see regularly that has huge

708
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,879
potential to be far more impactful over

709
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,319
time than just a generic centralized

710
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,820
source of cannabis but it's a great

711
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:48,178
start for helping the industry get

712
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:51,298
started uh it from the capital side yes

713
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:55,140
it's a big deal uh

714
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:56,879
uh because you know if you look at uh so

715
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,200
there's there's a we know a number of

716
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,120
these companies Sue Sicily who I've

717
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,798
known forever she has a D.A license in

718
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,538
Arizona she's doing some interesting

719
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,700
things it also helps on the Psychedelic

720
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:07,798
side but we've talked before I mean uh

721
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,538
you heard me earlier the Pharma

722
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:10,980
companies really are not the source of

723
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:14,278
innovation anymore it's biotech

724
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,919
companies but that has lowered the in

725
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:18,538
the U.S which is really still The Hub of

726
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,059
Biotech in the world

727
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:22,798
has lowered the activation energy to get

728
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,798
to market for example what is and why

729
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,480
it's a big deal BRC biotech research

730
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,119
company has a D.A license in California

731
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,339
hunter land who's a friend of mine is a

732
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,379
head Science Guy there they raised 20

733
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:37,740
million I think intrinsic lab or

734
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,899
intrinsic Partners LED that round uh and

735
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,880
so the 20 million bucks is a big deal

736
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,158
and then if you look at another of the

737
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,260
companies that owns a D.A license is

738
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,840
bright green they're public on the

739
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:51,319
NASDAQ so as far as capital yes it makes

740
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,319
a big deal

741
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,520
hi uh thank you for a fascinating

742
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:58,739
conversation

743
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,960
um I was particularly interested in the

744
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,880
data science aspect so about actually

745
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,380
clinical trials these past couple of

746
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,380
years I had some experience doing

747
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,640
clinical trials in cannabis from my PhD

748
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,659
research

749
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,640
um and

750
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:13,620
as I'm sure you know there's still

751
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,700
stigma still exists in senior scientific

752
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:20,579
boards like the incb it's still

753
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,200
um an uncertain regulatory landscape for

754
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,418
for a lot of Pharma companies to invest

755
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,640
in so I wanted to ask what do you think

756
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:30,480
of uh

757
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,399
real world data as an alternative to to

758
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,380
form the clinical research is it a valid

759
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,898
way around the problem and as a

760
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,880
follow-up question if so what kind of

761
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:41,278
what kind of data should we be

762
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,220
collecting what variables are most

763
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,038
important uh to to gather from The Real

764
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,500
World use of cannabis both medical use

765
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,079
or otherwise

766
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,259
do you want to go

767
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:58,918
so I mean I'm we are not as a company

768
00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:01,980
involved in the clinical trials so we

769
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:06,360
are collaborating with um with companies

770
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,058
that are using our extraction system to

771
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,439
produce

772
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:13,740
compounds which can then be used in

773
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,759
clinical trials so

774
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,558
um

775
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,819
a comment that I would like to make is

776
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,480
that

777
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:23,879
you know a few some months ago there was

778
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,940
a research studies that hits the the

779
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:31,039
news saying that most of the clinical

780
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:33,840
trials were in conclusion inconclusive

781
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:37,220
regarding the digitization of a

782
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:41,278
cannabinoids for a number of

783
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,740
pathologies so we we took a bit of time

784
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,038
entirely to review these

785
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,880
these research studies

786
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:49,319
meta studies

787
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,840
and

788
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:54,058
what we found out I mean not being again

789
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,000
a a company specialized in this field

790
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:59,038
but what we found out is that it was a

791
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,558
very interesting uh correlation let's

792
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:06,679
say between the studies that found kind

793
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:11,000
of be nice to be effective

794
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:15,960
with the subministration subministration

795
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,099
method so what I want to say is that

796
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:25,139
apparently the inhalation is uh is way

797
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:28,619
more effective than other ways and

798
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:31,500
and I think that that aspect

799
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:34,679
for for cannabis again I'm not a doctor

800
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,260
I'm not a physician but uh that's that's

801
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,320
what we found so we reveal the 2030

802
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,139
studies that were considered in in that

803
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,940
meta meta-analysis and and clearly there

804
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,800
was a strong correlation between the

805
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,918
inhalation and the effectiveness of the

806
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,919
treatment

807
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,699
I think it's really helpful I think the

808
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,099
the challenges that the retrospective

809
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,559
work where you have no handle at all on

810
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,119
what the user is taking and possibly

811
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,239
getting a beneficial therapeutic effect

812
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:06,480
is quite limited so we're about to run a

813
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:08,159
pilot actually in a cohort of chronic

814
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,179
inflammatory disorder I won't tell you

815
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,279
what it is but it's a chronic

816
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:14,399
inflammation

817
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,920
where we are going to be working with a

818
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,980
major university in the UK to collect

819
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,960
the material they're actually using

820
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,820
alongside collecting the if you like the

821
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,559
clinical data or the feet the

822
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,140
questionnaire feedback to do the

823
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,480
chemical analyzes of the material

824
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:32,219
they're using and then using data

825
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,579
science to your point to be able to look

826
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:37,199
for signals in those data so I think it

827
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,339
has huge potential we've we've been

828
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,919
doing it for decades it's called

829
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:42,719
ethnobotany we've just been doing it in

830
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,579
the Peruvian jungles and places like

831
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,779
that but hey it's time for us to bring

832
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,539
it into the Western World and start

833
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:51,599
doing it here too

834
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:53,519
just at a point Counterpoint on that I'm

835
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,200
assuming if you're doing real world data

836
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,099
you're talking non-clinical trials that

837
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,559
are out kind of like a phase four trial

838
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:03,420
uh yeah I I think that's it's it's great

839
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,400
the more data we have the better it is

840
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,559
to get rid of the stigma on the negative

841
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,780
side we know a group that was asked by

842
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,838
Mitch McConnell and the FDA to evaluate

843
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,119
CBD and CBD toxicity with a range of

844
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,440
different products in the U.S and they

845
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,480
came up with some really interesting

846
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,858
findings one of them being that CBD is

847
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,740
not that dangerous and actually had

848
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:24,239
beneficial effects on diabetes and they

849
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:27,179
sent that into the FDA guess what the

850
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,799
FDA did they buried it so Frankly

851
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:30,659
Speaking our thought is if you really

852
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,480
want to do real science

853
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,399
on cannabis and cannabinoids go to

854
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,019
Australia do it in Israel don't do in

855
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,820
the U.S because I think the FDA right

856
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,440
now is abdicating their leadership in

857
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,680
the role if you really want to know my

858
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,679
opinion

859
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,599
hello

860
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,059
okay

861
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,980
um

862
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:55,380
cannabis Association I think the point

863
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,280
is you know to look for opportunities in

864
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:02,579
science is not so difficult and before

865
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,380
the allowance of the German law bee farm

866
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,539
who is known as one of the strictest

867
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,300
rapporters in any kind of registration

868
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:12,960
process already made an allowance

869
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,839
for 44 indications to get it on a

870
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,599
special permission imported so I think

871
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,699
the road map where to go is there I

872
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,200
think what we are missing is is a

873
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:24,239
cannabis industry is to understand

874
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,578
ourselves as part of the pharmaceutical

875
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:29,399
industry and to figure out the

876
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,900
regulatory path and the dosage finding

877
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,059
because I think this is where we are

878
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,480
lacking data due to the prohibition for

879
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:39,719
a long time and here I think there will

880
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,300
be no avoidance of Coalition in somebody

881
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:45,239
who is knowing the regulatory path and

882
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,820
the clinical trial path and I think the

883
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:50,519
the 44 indications are unmet medical

884
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,039
need so anything what you can provide in

885
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:56,639
this area will be more than welcome by

886
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,559
the EMA by bee farm as not no not be fun

887
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,379
because they're all strict conditions

888
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,500
you go to the EMA and you get 26 markets

889
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,838
so I think it's not as difficult as we

890
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,539
might think

891
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:12,119
yeah I agree fundamentally with you I

892
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,739
think it's challenging when um so that

893
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,300
that process already exists it's how

894
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:16,858
Pharmaceuticals are developed and I'm

895
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,720
like you're saying the same thing and I

896
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:20,819
agree with you on that

897
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,679
um I think it is a problem when we just

898
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,900
decide that cannabis is going to be

899
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,480
relevant to X number of conditions

900
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,039
because we kind of like it that's not a

901
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,260
very scientific process so I would

902
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,539
suggest that we need to be a little bit

903
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,339
more open-minded in understanding the

904
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:36,900
fundamentals of how the biochemistry and

905
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:39,000
the pharmacokinetics of the molecules

906
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,160
work which we still don't understand

907
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,838
before we just go and put a blanket

908
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:44,279
those 44 other ones don't think about

909
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:46,440
anything else because you might

910
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,300
fundamentally be missing an enormous

911
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,838
opportunity left field which you just

912
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,839
don't look at

913
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,480
do do it works it does work

914
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,920
um a number of questions were asked in

915
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,079
previous panelists what's the most

916
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,700
important thing that could be done for

917
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:04,440
the Cannabis sector and I think you guys

918
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:06,659
sitting up there you've nailed it

919
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,579
basically it's the science that

920
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:11,279
increases the knowledge

921
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,200
that reduces the stigma so the question

922
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,240
is this is the stigma still going to be

923
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,519
here in four years time

924
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,979
or do you think the actions that you're

925
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:23,338
taking now will have removed that stigma

926
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:26,820
within that four years and if not how

927
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:31,219
can we improve the removal of stigma so

928
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,220
that it is long in four years

929
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,759
I'll say real quick I mean just two

930
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:38,280
examples Geographic it depends on your

931
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,839
geography John I mean if you look at

932
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,180
Malaysia and anybody especially

933
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,219
Australia knows about Malaysia they have

934
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:47,159
capital punishment for anybody with any

935
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,598
amount of cannabis any drug right or the

936
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,000
fact here if you're in Germany and you

937
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,220
go to Bavaria Bavaria is still not very

938
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,838
keen on on cannabis so I think the

939
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:57,539
stigma and how long it lasts going to be

940
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,279
geographically determined

941
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:03,599
so

942
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,579
I have maybe wrongfully but I have big

943
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:12,180
hope in the completion of the assessment

944
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:15,660
in the US at the base of uh eventual

945
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:18,419
decision for rescheduling so

946
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:21,539
I believe that you know if

947
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,680
the final outcome that is supposed to

948
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:28,679
happen by the end of the year

949
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:30,179
uh it's going to provide the basis for

950
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,159
an effective

951
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,659
for real I mean rescheduling let's say

952
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,759
above

953
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:39,179
last three

954
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:43,200
um I I expect that to have a big impact

955
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:44,639
because in in the end the on at least on

956
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:50,299
the western world

957
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:52,500
the the influence of uh you know the U.S

958
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,780
in many manner

959
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:59,579
the same manner that revision has been

960
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:04,140
kind of exported I think maybe that the

961
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:05,400
same type of opposite Trend kind of core

962
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:08,639
so

963
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,500
I really hope that this assessment is

964
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:14,098
sufficiently clear

965
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:16,559
to to provide the basis for the DEA

966
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,400
to to reschedule cannabis

967
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:22,078
I see that as a major Milestone if that

968
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,079
would not occur

969
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,660
I think many other countries like I'm

970
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,640
talking about for instance Italy we are

971
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:32,039
really far from eliminating the stigma

972
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,960
but really really far

973
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,219
and the sigma is also present in still

974
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,699
in California

975
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:42,838
I mean uh the the the the the

976
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:46,259
so we have a local team there and uh

977
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:49,199
you know some managers they even in

978
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,839
California they are they are avoiding to

979
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:55,199
they are avoiding to mention what their

980
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,880
job is when they you know when they when

981
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,039
they go to the school you know like

982
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,740
that's that situation in California so

983
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,000
in Europe when Italy is it's not it's

984
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:05,000
not possible for years I see

985
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:11,159
if I can add a comment so I work in

986
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,239
Europe's third largest chemical Park

987
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:18,358
which is hoaxed and I can tell you that

988
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:21,719
uh many of the world's top custom

989
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:23,578
chemical manufacturers right and for

990
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,578
example one of them a pharmaceutical

991
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:28,980
companies sanofi divested their Fine

992
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,160
Chemicals uh production to a company

993
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,500
they call Euro appy and Euro appy are my

994
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,899
neighbors and I was speaking with them

995
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,760
about

996
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,760
uh some you know doing some work on some

997
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,200
cannabinoids that's you know perfectly

998
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:49,099
regulatory compliant but they still feel

999
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:52,199
a stigma with these you know it's like

1000
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:54,059
uh and one of the the answers that they

1001
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,838
gave me one time as well they had just

1002
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:59,880
gone uh public you know uh been listed

1003
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,119
on the German Stock Exchange and they

1004
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,920
thought and they didn't they didn't want

1005
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,800
to have anything to do with any

1006
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,800
chemistry that touched upon cannabinoids

1007
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,660
and that includes even you know CBD they

1008
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,800
they didn't want to do anything with CBD

1009
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:19,199
because there's still that that stigma

1010
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:22,579
involved so I can say that a large

1011
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:24,779
German chemical manufacturers at least

1012
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:26,700
they still

1013
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,560
there's still too much of a stigma

1014
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:30,419
involved for them for them to become

1015
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,099
involved with these types of compounds

1016
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,720
can I respond to your question before

1017
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:35,640
you ask another one just really quickly

1018
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:38,759
I think

1019
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:40,679
um anything that verges on a religious

1020
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,760
experience or a mystical experience

1021
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:46,199
which cannabinoids psychedelics may do

1022
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,960
is always going to have a stigma

1023
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:51,358
associated with it with those who are

1024
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,420
looking to control the populace and

1025
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,400
therefore I think education of yourself

1026
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,940
so that you understand how to use that

1027
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,500
medicine beyond the medical practitioner

1028
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,900
is going to be a big part of how

1029
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,818
actually this becomes destigmatized and

1030
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,460
repatriated into the hands of the people

1031
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:12,000
who can treat themselves with it

1032
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:16,318
well put well put Sebastian thank you

1033
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,199
just one point or more you mentioned

1034
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,480
sorry can you hear me now yes so um one

1035
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:23,338
point more I was in Singapore last week

1036
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,079
we're looking at doing research here I

1037
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:26,578
was in Malaysia we're looking at doing

1038
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,740
research there so these Asian countries

1039
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,839
are moving along despite them hanging

1040
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:33,118
somebody in Singapore six weeks ago

1041
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:35,759
right we already operate in five

1042
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,818
countries so USA Canada UK Germany

1043
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,859
Australia and funnily enough Jamaica so

1044
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:42,960
I'm just the biggest problem we face

1045
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:45,000
around the world is stigma

1046
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,980
you guys have nailed it but we have to

1047
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,500
actually work together to overcome that

1048
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,300
stigma that's the one thing I think out

1049
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,760
of this whole Forum we need to actually

1050
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,260
grasp overcome the stigma the rest of

1051
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,119
the route will follow

1052
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,660
thank you so much let's hear it for the

1053
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,969
panel

1054
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:00,969
[Applause]
