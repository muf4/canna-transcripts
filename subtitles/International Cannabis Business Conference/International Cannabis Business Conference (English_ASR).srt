a lot of nice people with a lot of

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,240
information you can see the people kind

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
of go oh I hadn't thought about that

26
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,000
before it's raising a lot of

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,520
Consciousness about the social rep

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,078
percussions of prohibition and I'm not

29
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,560
sure that everybody here came in the

30
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,319
door worrying about that but more like

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,680
oh how can I make money or how can I fit

32
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,758
into the industry and I hear that

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,479
they're being inculcated with more and

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,118
more Progressive thought about why we're

35
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,840
doing this why we're fighting to end Pro

36
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,319
so what's happening in in in this

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,600
situation right here is people are a bit

38
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,279
overwhelmed by the breadth of the

39
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,640
understanding that people have for one

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,159
another and empathy and and you know

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,680
this might sound like some hyy toyy uh

42
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,520
stuff to if you're if you're just a

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,319
businessman well I'm a businessman I do

44
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,799
well in the industry and I believe in

45
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:15,039
karma I believe in community I believe

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,239
in love and understanding and I actually

47
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,560
believe if you hold true to some of

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,920
those tenants and precepts that you're

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,318
only going to benefit yourself for so

50
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,079
many reasons and and in my case it's

51
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,919
actually helped me make money also so

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,599
it's this new win-win situation that's

53
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,159
happening uh with the Cannabis industry

54
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,639
uh in particular and I I think that's

55
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,878
what people are very surprised about

56
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,958
that that they can make money they can

57
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:39,719
be successful and no one else has to to

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,439
lose all right it's the fastest growing

59
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,639

81
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,280
remember to keep the hippie ideals right

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,438
uh I've always proceeded from the idea

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,840
that the hippies were right and I try to

84
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,878
let that guide my actions uh but this

85
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,319
was a great conference you can go to om

here at the international cannabis

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,158
business conference you know when we

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,438
when we started doing this or when we

91
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,919
had the concept to come up with the

92
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:59,759
international cannabis business

93
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,039
conference uh of course business

94
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,840
business is is in the title however we

95
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,318
wanted to do a whole ton of advocacy

96
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,319
politics and culture that's our that's

97
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,878
our passion that's what we were pushing

98
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:12,039
and we were curious of how people would

99
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,000
react to it there's so many other

100
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,120
business conferences out there that uh

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,759
talk about Investment Banking or penny

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,639
stocks or whatever and we thought if we

103
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,360
did a business conference that was not

104
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,000
just focusing on on business business

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,600
business and money money money we

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,720
thought we were actually taking a chance

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,439
and people might not groove on that or

108
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,800
or not get what they expect for their

109
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,240
highend uh ticket price well uh what's

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,680
happened in fact is people are actually

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,038
overly excited and happy that we have

112
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,840
decided to dedicate so much of this to

113
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:49,240
culture politics and uh advocacy and I'm

114
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,560
tremendously happy with the

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,639
feedback I never doubt a small group of

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,959
concerned citizens can change the world

117
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,759

118
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,758
