1
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:20,710
so hi everyone hi everyone so I'd like

2
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:24,009
to thank Alex in the ICB icbc foot for

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,469
this award I don't think of it as a

4
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:31,059
Lifetime Achievement Award more as a

5
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:33,159
tenacious miss of work and this it could

6
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,429
be an inspiration to everyone here if

7
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:39,689
you just last long enough eventually

8
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:43,359
they'll call you an elder states person

9
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,329
so that hasn't happened to me yet but I

10
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:52,210
think that it will at some point maybe

11
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:54,159
so anyway I worked long and hard on this

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,570
because I didn't want to do a Donald

13
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,339
Trump you know I actually have a speech

14
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,540
it's an hour and a half I hope you don't

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:07,719
mind did it it's my entire views of the

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:14,680
entire world and the situation and it is

17
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:17,978
dire but actually more of my philosophy

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,190
is one of a great 20th century baseball

19
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:23,379
player satchel paige and he's not

20
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:25,959
recognized a lot because spent most of

21
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:28,839
his time in the black leagues but he did

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,899
say somebody said he could turn off the

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,810
light and get under the covers before

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,060
before the light went out and he did say

25
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:41,590
don't look back they might be gaining on

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:44,200
you and you know you start looking back

27
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,770
to get scary about some of the things

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,810
that you did in the past and I'd never

29
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:58,569
do those things now so close Castaneda

30
00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:01,090
who was a writer about spirituality had

31
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:04,779
a character in his books by the name of

32
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:07,719
Don Juan and Don Juan was this Indian

33
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,068
Shaymin from the southwest and he had

34
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:15,489
all the psychedelics in these different

35
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,619
different psycho phytochemicals and he

36
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:24,209
said

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:28,370
and his his said that his he had this

38
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:31,319
Ally plant that he would smoke and then

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,689
after I read that book eventually I

40
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,469
smoke marijuana not to eventually but i

41
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:40,620
did and i realized that i don't know if

42
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:43,348
that was exactly his ally but i realized

43
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,408
that marijuana was my ally and i

44
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:48,149
realized later on something that you

45
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:50,939
know the difference between marijuana

46
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:58,409
and politicians is that good marijuana

47
00:02:50,939 --> 00:03:01,439
never told a lie so and i think that the

48
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,479
reason why i like marijuana so much was

49
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,239
described by aldous huxley when he

50
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:09,209
talked about psychedelics and he said

51
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,209
that you know we develop the brain the

52
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,848
mind in our brain as a filter and it

53
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,769
filters out we learned what to filter

54
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:20,068
out and how to filter it out depending

55
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:23,599
on what society were in and so we have

56
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:26,250
sort of boxed in and he said that

57
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,560
psychedelics alter the brain's ability

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,840
to be a filter so all these thoughts

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,699
that would be boxed in and wouldn't come

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,340
into consciousness because they didn't

61
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,798
fit the mold start shooting out and

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,469
that's certainly what marijuana does to

63
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,079
me and I'm sure to most people here and

64
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:46,530
i'll just give you one example of it you

65
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,689
know that obama when he first became

66
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,090
president had marijuana deficiency

67
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:55,109
syndrome which people used to laugh at

68
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,239
when I said that and then when when

69
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,489
physician started saying if they took it

70
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,099
more seriously for some reason but

71
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:05,159
anyway with marijuana deficiency

72
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,988
syndrome he was not able to make wise

73
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,269
decisions in the beginning and that's

74
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:12,180
why he was taken over the coals by the

75
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,759
banking industry and if he had only been

76
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,329
able to smoke marijuana and look at

77
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:21,120
things from both the straight with a

78
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,120
straight mind and all would somewhat

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,550
altered mind that what would allow him

80
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,280
to be creative we wouldn't have gone

81
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,340
through the

82
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,809
wrenching thing that that we did and a

83
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,119
lot of the people who were wearing

84
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:44,379
pinstripes would be wearing horizontals

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:49,720
now so if marijuana teaches you to think

86
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:53,230
outside the box then thank you somebody

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,380
said they agree so I consider that a

88
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,200
vast majority so if somebody they think

89
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:03,668
so if you start thinking outside the box

90
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,729
then you're going to change so you could

91
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:12,729
say marijuana is an agent a catalyst of

92
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:17,189
change and and we need a lot of change

93
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:20,979
you know recently I've been annoying

94
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:24,910
people who work with me at quick trading

95
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:26,740
with some songs from the 60s and i'm not

96
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:31,240
i'm neither going to sing them to apply

97
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:36,160
them for you but one of them was the

98
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,829
mothers of inventions called song called

99
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,169
trouble coming every day and if you look

100
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:43,629
at that on youtube and with certain some

101
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:48,038
of the videos as long as 50 years old

102
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:51,129
but it could be taking place it could

103
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,620
have been taking place this summer you

104
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:56,168
know on the streets except that most of

105
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,720
the videos show people rioting and in

106
00:05:56,168 --> 00:06:03,099
this case it's cops rioting really and

107
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:06,280
then a second was is Donovan season of

108
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,590
the witch I should say the second is

109
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,259
really for the fugs kill for peace and

110
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:13,538
in that song from fifty years ago they

111
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,490
say if you don't kill them the Russians

112
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:19,300
will if you don't want America to play

113
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:22,389
second fiddle kill for peace and isn't

114
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,360
that what it's going on right now 50

115
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:29,159
years later different countries same war

116
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,259
and then the third was and this is more

117
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,080
applicable directly to what we're doing

118
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:38,769
now and why people are here it's

119
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,618
Donovan's season of the witch and in

120
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:48,368
that he has one line

121
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:52,839
beatniks out to make it rich well

122
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:59,289
hippies whatever right come on recognize

123
00:06:52,838 --> 00:07:02,788
yourselves so the reason why I got into

124
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:06,519
marijuana is because I hate war and

125
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:09,368
marijuana is an agent of change and we

126
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:12,248
have not only Americans but the whole

127
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:15,669
world has to change and we have to get

128
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:19,088
out of war and anti the war on ourselves

129
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:21,068
in the war on environment and those two

130
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:23,408
things are really important and the only

131
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:26,229
way to do it is to change consciousness

132
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:28,118
laws don't do it regulations don't do it

133
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:31,568
it's a change of consciousness and

134
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:34,389
marijuana helps you get out of that box

135
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:47,259
so you can actually see reality and

136
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:53,918
that's why I'm in marijuana now you know

137
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:56,079
I wrote this marijuana users Bill of

138
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,609
Rights which you can just go on google

139
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:03,399
and google that in and it will come

140
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:08,098
right up and one of those is that and

141
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:10,718
ultimately that the questions or the

142
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:16,808
though that Bill of Rights brings to

143
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:19,718
mind some something and that is if it's

144
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:24,399
a question of freedom or profit what do

145
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:26,978
you choose now i would say moat many of

146
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,990
the people who are now in marijuana have

147
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:32,168
chosen prophet they don't really care

148
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,408
about freedom you know freedom is um in

149
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:37,978
let's close the door and I don't I don't

150
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:42,490
really think that that's a really good

151
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:45,009
policy for society I think it's a stupid

152
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:49,600
policy and I think it's a policy that

153
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:52,180
ultimately brings illegality and illicit

154
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,110
activities because if you can't get in

155
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,479
the door you're still

156
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,009
going to do it so how are you going to

157
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,450
do it you're going to do it outside the

158
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:04,028
door and I hate the term organized

159
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,600
organized crime as I understand it and

160
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:11,259
as I've seen it marijuana outside of the

161
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,750
system is disorganized crime totally

162
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,088
disorganized so if they want to talk

163
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,389
about organized crime and heroin or

164
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:22,120
something or oxycontin with the cartels

165
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:28,720
that are making all these opioids fine

166
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:30,789
but leave marijuana out of it I'm please

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,129
please when people say well we're

168
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:35,379
protecting society from organized crime

169
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:38,189
and all that that's they're

170
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:45,070
protecting society from people like us

171
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:51,610
ultimately come on so what I think is

172
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:53,680
that you know profits really great but

173
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,659
i'd rather have freedom if it's a choice

174
00:09:53,679 --> 00:10:02,588
of profit or freedom I'll take freedom

175
00:09:55,659 --> 00:10:06,429
every time every time and you know only

176
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:08,829
the people who really believe that who

177
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:12,399
are willing to fight for that they're

178
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:14,439
the only people who have freedom you

179
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,909
know I used to belong to the yuppies

180
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,860
youth in youth international party and

181
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:25,120
we had a saying when freedom is outlawed

182
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:28,180
only outlaws will be free and that you

183
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,149
know there are different like people are

184
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:32,799
saying well prop 64 it legalizes

185
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:35,259
marijuana yeah if you have under an

186
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,958
ounce if you've one of the chosen few

187
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:40,539
who gets it who gets a license that then

188
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,549
it then marijuana is legal but if you

189
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,889
have over an ounce if you want to grow

190
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:46,809
more than if you want to grow plants in

191
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,139
a county that doesn't allow plant

192
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:53,078
growing if you have if you want to sell

193
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:55,120
to your friend if you don't if you're

194
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:58,000
not within the system then marijuana

195
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,940
isn't legal that's why prompt 64 is a

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,778
farce and as much as people who keep

197
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,579
saying that prop 64 has to pass or else

198
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:09,159
marijuana will be set back

199
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:10,868
no no no we're not going to we should

200
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:15,249
not sacrifice the people of California

201
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:17,619
for other people's ambition 64 is just

202
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:19,689
when you read it when you actually read

203
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:22,059
it it's total you could be

204
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:23,769
totally legal in one County step over

205
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:26,078
the line you're illegal at

206
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:28,539
fractionalized it's California it's a

207
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:32,019
terrible law and the worst part of it is

208
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:35,379
it keeps the cops n who wants cops n

209
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:37,028
anybody nobody here wants cops in their

210
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:39,009
system they'd rather have civil

211
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:41,619
regulation well you better start telling

212
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,139
the people on Prop who are voting who

213
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:47,139
are campaigning for prop 64 what you

214
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:50,019
think of it because if you want cops in

215
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,629
your system and taking your money you

216
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,970
know one thing that Assad knows don't

217
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:57,489
feed your enemies that's why he's had

218
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:01,569
that siege at Aleppo all this time I'm

219
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:04,959
not saying I'm pro pro him but but prop

220
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:08,678
64 and the Oregon initiative both of

221
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,359
them feed the cops can you believe that

222
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:13,659
you're feeding your enemies I don't

223
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,999
understand it I don't get it that I

224
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:17,708
don't think that's legal action so I

225
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:23,980
wasn't going to I promise not to talk

226
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:26,318
about 64 month or so so you know I think

227
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,168
that marijuana is an agent of change and

228
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:32,798
I think that we really need this agent

229
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:34,659
of change because you know we're at war

230
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:36,999
with the world I don't only mean the

231
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:39,308
United States I mean people are at war

232
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:42,909
with the world there were war with their

233
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:47,428
mother they drill it they pierce it they

234
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:50,678
tear it up they break its skin they put

235
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:54,278
they fill it with concrete they make it

236
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:57,100
poisonous they toxify it how can we live

237
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:58,928
that is it so eat on musk and a couple

238
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,360
of others are going to go try and find

239
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:03,039
another planet but I don't you know

240
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,808
there's a difference between columbus

241
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,448
coming to america and us going to

242
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:10,328
interspace and the difference is he had

243
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:12,248
air to breathe and when he got here when

244
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:16,838
he got to the new world there was food

245
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:19,680
to eat big difference and you know and

246
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:24,990
there was intercourse back and forth but

247
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:27,149
between between the contents but we when

248
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,970
you go out into space it's a one-way

249
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:37,230
journey and you better take everything

250
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:46,769
with you oh we forgot a piano did

251
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:51,930
anybody take the Dylan tapes so actually

252
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:54,389
as bad as 64 is the one thing that it

253
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:57,829
will do is get more marijuana to people

254
00:13:54,389 --> 00:14:01,470
and that's the most important thing and

255
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:04,020
the reason for that is it just what I

256
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,230
was saying is that marijuana is an agent

257
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:10,528
of change and being an agent of change I

258
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,259
think that these laws or any laws that

259
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:15,720
stopped the free market in marijuana and

260
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,879
what I don't mean a regulated market I

261
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,700
don't mean that you know anybody should

262
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:24,028
be able to sell any quality marijuana

263
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,920
just like they can food no I'm talking

264
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:29,039
about a regulated market that protects a

265
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,958
consumer but but anyssa body should be

266
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,088
able to get into it and anybody should

267
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,338
be able to get out of it and anybody

268
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:37,080
should be able to buy and anybody should

269
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,209
be able to sell as long as they have a

270
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,650
license in the zoning and everything

271
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,399
else in the state shouldn't be able to

272
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:45,360
say I like you but I don't like you

273
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,309
shouldn't be able to do that it

274
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,339
shouldn't be able to say oh we have

275
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:52,319
enough licenses so you let all the

276
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,730
stores that want to open open and you

277
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,220
know that most of them are going to

278
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,930
close right and people think Oh people's

279
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,480
people are going to have their life

280
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:03,059
dreams dashed of owning a store but

281
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,399
that's life but it's not the state doing

282
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,439
it it's a market doing it and when the

283
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,659
market does it it's okay for that to

284
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,910
happen for the market to say I like this

285
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,860
door I don't like that store but it's

286
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:16,769
not okay for the state to do that to

287
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,778
people because we're all equal we should

288
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,088
all have equal opportunity and it

289
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:24,919
shouldn't be who got here first we're

290
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:28,279
not taking any more applications that's

291
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:31,159
its demanding just talking

292
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,720
and and you know what here's the other

293
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,469
thing that I have to say about that is

294
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,670
that you know you could be a farmer

295
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,149
nobody says you have to make a profit

296
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:43,370
and what I mean by that is farming is

297
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,379
farming and it's a very risky business

298
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,558
and there's you know environmental

299
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:50,209
things there's all kinds of problems and

300
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:51,799
you know of course when you have a great

301
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,929
crop the price goes down because

302
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:55,609
everybody else has so nobody says

303
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:57,679
farmers have to make a profit but

304
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,778
everybody should be allowed to try to

305
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,669
make a profit in and if they want to

306
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:03,980
farm everybody should be allowed to farm

307
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:07,490
as long as they're on proper farming

308
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:10,159
land or in proper area anybody disagree

309
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:13,818
with that you know brendan kennedy said

310
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,289
the same thing it's it's I think that

311
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:17,028
there's rude anybody who's read

312
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:19,639
marijuana growers handbook and I'm sure

313
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:21,230
everybody here has if you know if you

314
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,049
haven't you should immediately go out

315
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,089
and pick up a copy and read it and in it

316
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,938
there's a there's a page about the

317
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:32,180
tomato model you know with tomatoes

318
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:35,740
there are large tomato growers there are

319
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:37,909
small tomato growers there they're

320
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,159
international companies national

321
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:42,730
companies regional companies local farms

322
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:46,338
and neighbor to neighbor sales and

323
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,740
everybody's doing okay with tomatoes and

324
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,680
I think it could be like that here I'm

325
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,058
not opposed to giant corporations I just

326
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,789
think that we should allow all

327
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:57,740
corporations and all people to do

328
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:59,419
whatever they want in marijuana as long

329
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,100
as it they're following the rules and

330
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,318
doing it legally and the rules should

331
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,078
allow them to do it anybody disagree

332
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,119
with that well that's what we have to

333
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,490
fight for and that's what we're not

334
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,889
getting and none of the laws do this and

335
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,740
all these state legislators who are so

336
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:19,579
in favor of capitalism except when it

337
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:24,399
comes to to to marijuana for instance in

338
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:26,959
in California but note profit-making

339
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:29,298
dispensaries are allowed no

340
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,519
profit-making dispensaries but it's such

341
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:35,480
a capitalist state could you imagine if

342
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,490
they had said okay no you know computers

343
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,870
are so important to society that we

344
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,630
shouldn't allow any of these companies

345
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:42,839
to make a

346
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,670
profit just think how far advanced much

347
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,369
further advanced we would have been with

348
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:52,800
computers now like we would have been up

349
00:17:47,369 --> 00:18:01,769
to 128 not billion but millions no or

350
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:04,829
whatever it's how so okay so so I think

351
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:07,019
that marijuana has to become totally

352
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:09,509
civil and we have to get the cops out of

353
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,339
it and we have to get the legislators

354
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:14,789
out of it to the extent that they allow

355
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:17,699
a free market but on the other hand we

356
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:20,940
also have to make sure that that people

357
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,960
have the ability and the right to use

358
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:27,360
marijuana as a light so that we can

359
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:33,559
change society and become a more loving

360
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:38,509
