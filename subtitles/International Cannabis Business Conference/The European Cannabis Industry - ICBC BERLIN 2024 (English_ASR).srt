00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,879
all right here to discuss the European

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,160
cannabis industry the head of the

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,800
European cannabis group for Dentons

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,638
let's hear it for Peter

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,920
[Applause]

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,919
humberg ladies and

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,118
gentlemen good

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,800
morning one year ago I have been

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,320
standing here and presented what was a

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,839
plan for

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,599
legalization which was significantly

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,799
different from the original proposal of

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,840
the German government back in October

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:40,119
2022 it was and I have to say that and

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,039
sorry for disturbing the party a partial

16
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,679
legalization we are far away from Full

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,000
legalization which the government

18
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,759
actually wanted to

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,039
establish and the Germans wouldn't be

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:56,119
Germans if there are not funny stories

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,719
about all this and you know Germans have

22
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:02,799
a very special sense of

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,879
humor and let me just uh Enlighten you

24
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:09,759
with two very funny

25
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,679
stories the first one uh our Chancellor

26
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,560
Olaf Schultz as you may know is

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,640
currently in China having diplomatic

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,560
talks in

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,159
China regarding various

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,400
issues yesterday in a official statement

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,520
about the

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,799
talks in a side remark he said this

33
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,840
shiny Nation should not get the

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,120
impression that all Germans are now

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,759
smoking

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,600
[Music]

37
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,920
weat what kind of statement is that you

38
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,679
know even the Chinese president could

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,960
have say well you should not get the

40
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,000
impression that 1.4 4 billion Chinese

41
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:55,118
people are getting drunk every evening

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,519
so uh as I said it's a kind of a sad

43
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:01,680
rather sad story and by the way uh where

44
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,840
is no uh if if you actually if you

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,840
actually have weed with you and you're

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,200
smoking you're not uh a patient and

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,080
that's the next funny story and you're

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,399
traveling to B wenberg which is one of

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,599
our states here it could be that the

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,239
police is questioning you where you have

51
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:21,079
the wheat

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,080
from because for home grow it's too

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,800
early it's 15 days you couldn't grow

54
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,360
that at home uh the social clubs or the

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,080
cultivation associations are not yet in

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,480
place so the question is where did you

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,560
get your read

58
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,959
from and your questions of course as a

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,439
witness because after the legalization

60
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,680
you will not be punished if you are

61
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,800
carrying less than 25 G in

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,680
public and if you don't answer correctly

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,879
well you can be imprisoned for

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,879
contempt that's what the police and

65
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:55,919
Barton wenberg actually said so don't

66
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,039
travel to stutgart and smoke openly I

67
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,439
would say at least for the time

68
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,840
being so welcome to the the club last

69
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,280
one

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,039
laughing so what we're going to do this

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,799
morning after these uh funny stories we

72
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,318
get a little bit more serious let me see

73
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,920
whe I can do that yeah so we are talking

74
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,679
about a little bit of

75
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,439
business that's what we all are

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,680
interested in besides the various

77
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,079
legalization issues I would like to take

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,840
you on

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,799
a on a journey through various uh

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,280
European countries where do we stay

81
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,920
stand there of course I will Enlighten

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,080
you a little bit about Germany and what

83
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,199
is going to happen there just really

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,920
saying these what are the real points in

85
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,079
this uh legalization process and then we

86
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,000
going to Czech Republic Malta Portugal

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,599
Spain Switzerland the Netherlands and

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,199
the UK and then we'll see what can we

89
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:56,280
expect in the

90
00:03:53,199 --> 00:04:00,280
future and if we look into

91
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,919
the uh industry estimates here and I

92
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,799
don't want to bother you too much with

93
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:09,238
facts and figures I have only two slides

94
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,200
of that um is that the expectations uh

95
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,519
are

96
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,798
significantly high if you look into the

97
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,918
Cannabis Market in Europe uh forecasted

98
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,159
for

99
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,639
2024 it looks like $6.2 billion

100
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,320
US well if you look into the medical

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,680
Market uh which was I would say nicely

102
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,439
developing in Germany but of course has

103
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,918
not reached uh its a full extent for

104
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,000
various reasons uh this is a figure

105
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,240
which is not too far away from my point

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,160
of view from

107
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,759
reality uh as we have heard uh this

108
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:50,720
morning uh prescriptions within the

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:54,800
first 14 days of since April 1st have

110
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,919
really doubled in to some expect it is

111
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,960
an increasing Market we didn't we we saw

112
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:04,519
that the legalization of cannabis taking

113
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,758
cannabis and THC related products out of

114
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,680
the narcotics act would have also a

115
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,759
positive effect on the prescriptions in

116
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,720
the medical Market but nobody expected

117
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,360
that these figures in the first two

118
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,560
weeks really would appear uh we have

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,840
clients who have platforms bringing

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,319
patients pharmacies and Physicians

121
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:29,879
together and they have need tripled the

122
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:33,639
prescriptions uh for since before in

123
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:37,199
comparison to the time before April 1st

124
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,478
so the medical Market is really going

125
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,240
forward the effect of that legalization

126
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:45,519
and we will see that in a minute is

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:50,918
significant so these are the forecasts

128
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:53,758
of the uh sales here uh and the turnover

129
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,439
uh of CBD products Medical Products

130
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,319
pharmaceutical cannabis products like

131
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,079
sax for example uh and the recreational

132
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,039
cannabis

133
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,159
so it's a significant growth which we'll

134
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:09,680
see so this legalization even it's only

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,439
partial has a significant effect Market

136
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,319
in Europe and we will see other

137
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,598
countries and I come back to that in a

138
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,479
minute we will see other countries

139
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:20,918
following the approach of Germany uh and

140
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,918
we all know and I will show you that

141
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:26,799
once again why the uh

142
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,639
legalization actually is not what we

143
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,439
call a full legalization uh but it has

144
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,560
has its positive effect of course these

145
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,680
facts and figures here may be a little

146
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,439
bit too optimistic and we have seen even

147
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,160
after the legalization of medical

148
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:46,000
Canabis back in 2017 in Germany some

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,840
figures which have never been reached uh

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,439
but uh it the legalization has a real

151
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,239
impact on the industry and I will come

152
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:59,038
back to that in a

153
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,759
minute so this is the pathway of Germany

154
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,759
and I don't want to elaborate too much

155
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:07,120
on that how we actually legalized uh

156
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,360
cannabis here in Germany I think the

157
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,680
most in important key points are October

158
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,280
2022 where the full legalization like in

159
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,439
Canada was proposed by the government

160
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,959
followed

161
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,839
by constructive talks with the European

162
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,120
commission as Mr labach our minister of

163
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,519
heals actually said well I have of

164
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,519
course a little bit of different

165
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,680
definition of constructive because the

166
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,000
outcome is that we have now a partial

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,959
legalization with hom grow cultivation

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
in clubs and of course the uh

169
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,439
decriminalization which is a step

170
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,560
forward but it's far away from the full

171
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,800
extent of legalization as we have seen

172
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,839
that in the program of the government

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,879
back in

174
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:52,918
2022 the German government was afraid of

175
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,759
being sued by the European Commission

176
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,000
because they clearly made a statement

177
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,639
you not should not go forward with that

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,560
plan even as a pilot country here in

179
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,038
within the in the European Union um and

180
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,478
we will sue you before the European

181
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,439
court of justice for the breach of the

182
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,478
Shen agreement and that was a convincing

183
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,839
argument for the government not to do

184
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,839
the full

185
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,720
legalization so if we look like now into

186
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,318
the uh consumption and cultivation rules

187
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,680
here in Germany and we have heard that

188
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,400
this morning I've just put that together

189
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,000
as a brief summary so the most important

190
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:33,838
one is cannabis has been removed of the

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,799
list of prohibited prohibited substances

192
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,760
in the German narcotics

193
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,478
act uh it is now put into the new

194
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,159
Canabis act and of course all offenses

195
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,120
and the punishments have been

196
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:50,199
significantly reduced uh it is still

197
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,639
forbidden actually and that is what you

198
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,600
should know to even hand over uh the

199
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,480
wheat which you have cultivated at home

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,000
to your friend absolutely no goal you

201
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,759
cannot even uh uh give it to one of your

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,360
family members actually if they are not

203
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,559
growing that uh like your uncle who's

204
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:14,000
visiting you from stard for example so

205
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:16,559
uh these are some I would say uh very

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,278
difficult to understand regulations out

207
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:24,039
of this new cannabis act but it has all

208
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:26,639
to do with the consequences that to be

209
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,039
compliant as much as possible under the

210
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,919
UN 961 convention the Shen agreement and

211
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:36,360
its protols so there should be no sales

212
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:39,078
uh there should be no profit making uh

213
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,759
cultivation so these are and we will see

214
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,639
that in a minute with regard to the

215
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,958
Cannabis cultivation associations these

216
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,600
are not cannabis Social Clubs we are far

217
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,639
away from that it's a cultivation

218
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:55,278
Association where up to 500 members can

219
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,000
come together and grow their eat even

220
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,759
third parties are not allowed to touch

221
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,120
the plant only members can do that this

222
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,000
is all what we have seen the Cannabis

223
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,679
which is

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,078
a in part in Parts very detailed in

225
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:13,639
other parts it's has a lots of

226
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:16,399
loopholes uh and again of course here uh

227
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:20,480
the in private space you can store up to

228
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,200
50 g dried flowers this was the last

229
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,440
amendment in the law why 50 GRS well if

230
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,480
you cultivate three uh flowers or if you

231
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,480
have two family members who are growing

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,240
six flowers and you're harvesting it

233
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,360
well I I'm not a cultivator but this can

234
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,600
definitely be reached quickly if the 50

235
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:47,120
g dried flowers really

236
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:50,759
quickly sorry PL yes right so they have

237
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,519
increased that uh and the 25 gram of uh

238
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:57,879
you can carry not only four you can

239
00:10:52,519 --> 00:11:01,519
actually uh carry 25 G uh I have no idea

240
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:03,838
why 25 G should be here the threshold uh

241
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,360
you may ask those who have actually

242
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,440
implemented in the law 25 it's a lot 25

243
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,000
G is a lot I would say well there are

244
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,880
calculations 70 70 uh joints something

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,320
like that 25 gr uh it doesn't sound uh

246
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,240
wrong so uh that is what you can carry

247
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,040
in

248
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,639
public and again we have some some rules

249
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:32,759
and regulations which which are somehow

250
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:36,360
strange uh for example uh uh where you

251
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:39,559
can actually smoke of course away from

252
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,720
kindergartens sport Arenas Etc where you

253
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:46,359
have to keep a distance of 100

254
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,800
m uh there's also something in provision

255
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,720
in the law if you can't see it the

256
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,479
school the kindergarten you can actually

257
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,959
smoke there yeah it could be less than

258
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,039
100 m you are not allowed to smoke in

259
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:01,359
pedestrian areas in the time between I

260
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,958
think 8 a.m. till 8:00

261
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,519
p.m. but but don't count me on that on

262
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:11,599
that time for whatever reason so uh as I

263
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:15,799
said it is to a certain extent uh an

264
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,159
interesting approach uh and uh we'll see

265
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:22,919
how this actually will work out in the

266
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:26,559
next weeks when everybody can Harvest at

267
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,639
home and then the social clubs or

268
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,799
cannabis cultivation associations will

269
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,799
become active

270
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:36,399
with uh July

271
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,759
1st maybe just a word with regard to

272
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:44,159
these Social

273
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:48,039
Clubs the the law now is totally silent

274
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,799
on where how and under which

275
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,198
circumstances a cultivation Association

276
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:57,120
can apply for a license to grow they

277
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:59,639
need a license that is clear so it is

278
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,078
left now to the states

279
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,240
and of course to the communities to set

280
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,120
up rules and regulations under which

281
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,198
circumstances the cultivation

282
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,480
associations can actually

283
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:14,479
operate and Frankly Speaking they are

284
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,639
helpless they are helpless they are

285
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,320
looking for guidance because you know

286
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,159
they have neither the infrastructure nor

287
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,040
the Personnel nor the financial

288
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:29,120
financials in order to really implement

289
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:34,198
this infrastructure to control the CL

290
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:37,959
clubs to license the clubs to check the

291
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:40,838
applications uh and as such I'm not that

292
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:42,679
confident that we will very quickly see

293
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,680
those cultivation associations being

294
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:48,879
operative well 1 of July is the due date

295
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:51,519
so until then the respective uh

296
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,439
authorities have to have implemented the

297
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,879
respective rules and regulations for

298
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,600
these clubs there are already so-called

299
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:01,799
f as we say in Germany who have a Lish

300
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,759
themselves and who are ready to get into

301
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,240
operation but they don't even know to

302
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,240
whom they should file any kind of

303
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,399
application there's not even a form uh

304
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,720
in which they could actually send the

305
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,720
application and of course no

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,559
Authority let's have a look into the

307
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,519
medical cannabis and I mentioned that

308
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:28,559
already uh it is for the medical

309
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,000
cannabis a big step forward that

310
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:34,679
cannabis and THC rated products are

311
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,839
taken out of the German narcotics

312
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:42,519
act uh there is a new prescription

313
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:45,600
requirement Which is less strict as the

314
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,198
prescription of a narcotic so Physicians

315
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,920
do not have even to register with the

316
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:53,439
bay form they have they should not use

317
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,559
the I would say red prescription blocks

318
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,240
uh where which is kind of a

319
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:02,119
psychological barrier anyway uh to

320
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,000
prescribe kind of so that relaxation has

321
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,799
actually caused the increase of

322
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,519
prescriptions uh in the last a couple of

323
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,519
weeks

324
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,278
um and what is of course also important

325
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:21,399
the uh certain relaxations with regard

326
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:23,799
to where you can actually uh purchase

327
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:29,519
your readed with the respective

328
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:33,159
prescriptions in the pharmacies

329
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,078
having said that for Germany uh we jump

330
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:38,480
into the next or travel to the next

331
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,679
country which is the Czech Republic the

332
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,839
Czech Republic has always been

333
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:47,359
supportive of the German approach uh

334
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,000
very open uh with respect to the uh

335
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,519
legalization process uh and medical

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,879
cannabis was already legalized back in

337
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:03,879
2013 um and in the use of recreation

338
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:06,958
uh cannabis is is still illegal uh there

339
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,000
are also some uh rules with regard to

340
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,719
new

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,440
substances uh which uh came up on that

342
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:19,278
market which of course also are causing

343
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,680
some uh issues here like hhco and

344
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:25,000
thcp uh and you will see in a minute

345
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,758
that the Czech government is taking care

346
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,318
of these as

347
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,519
well um

348
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:35,879
what the what is expected here is that

349
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,480
there will be a certain legalization uh

350
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:42,799
in due course uh in in in Czech Republic

351
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,879
as well and in 2025 actually at

352
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,120
beginning of 2025 these restrictions of

353
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:52,318
these new seven uh substances will be

354
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,078
reviewed again uh and there is still

355
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:57,879
kind of a stand still the they were very

356
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,719
when we started our legalization process

357
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,559
in Germany they were very Force coming

358
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,318
and now it slowed down a little uh and

359
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:09,958
we actually the Czech Republic wanted to

360
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,599
go for full legalization uh in order to

361
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,318
challenge the European commission and

362
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,918
see what's going to happen uh risking to

363
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,798
be sued before the European court of

364
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,079
justice for the violation of the shenen

365
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:23,400
agreement this is off the table uh at Le

366
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,759
until now unfortunately because they

367
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,798
would have of course uh one of those

368
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,640
countries which have uh actually then uh

369
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:34,480
probably before the European court of

370
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,200
justice at least make their stand Point

371
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,599
very clear unfortunately it's a little

372
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,759
bit of a change right

373
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,038
now we travel to Malta well not the

374
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:47,640
largest member in within the European

375
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,119
Union but one of those as we heard this

376
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,640
morning who started their legalization

377
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:56,759
process and uh yes indeed it looks like

378
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,559
that the German legislature has copied a

379
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:02,158
little bit of what the males government

380
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,279
has done with regard to the Cannabis

381
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,480
Social

382
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:10,399
Clubs uh which are the

383
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,798
CH cannabis harm reduction

384
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,440
associations um in January 2024 so just

385
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:22,400
recently the first club actually became

386
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,400
active started its operation and the

387
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,000
maltes have actually

388
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,798
established an authority for the

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,960
responsible use of cannabis who actually

390
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:39,279
are testing um the quality of the weed

391
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,558
which is cultivated in these clubs

392
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,038
jumping back to Germany yes this will

393
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:47,798
happen here as well what is going to be

394
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:51,200
tested is not clear uh what is clear is

395
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:55,519
that the members who are between 18 to

396
00:18:51,200 --> 00:19:01,480
21 only get flowers with a THC content

397
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:04,440
of 10% or less uh with only 30 grams all

398
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,880
other adults above 21 uh there's no

399
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,919
limit except that they will get only 50

400
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,799
g a month uh what kind of quality well

401
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,720
again I we don't know whether it's gacp

402
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,359
or whether it's anybody's asking for GMP

403
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,640
or just a regular control with regard to

404
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:25,038
any kind of uh substances is also not

405
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,440
yet clear here we have an authority in

406
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:31,919
Malta who is taking care of that

407
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,200
all right from Malta from the little

408
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,200
island in the Mediterranean to

409
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,320
Portugal 2018 we had already the

410
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:45,440
legalization of medical cannabis uh

411
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:48,599
recreational is not legal but it has

412
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,600
been decriminalized to a certain extent

413
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:54,399
uh so if you look into consumption and

414
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:57,199
possession of small amounts uh there

415
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,440
will be no real

416
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,120
punishment uh which is a step forward

417
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,000
there it is of course away from what we

418
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,439
have done here in Germany with regard to

419
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,558
the legalization and the very very

420
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,720
strict uh decriminalization of

421
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,519
possession uh currently there are two

422
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,120
drafts uh in Portugal that allow the

423
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,359
consumption cultivation and possession

424
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,319
of cannabis for recreational use and uh

425
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,759
well we'll see what the government will

426
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,439
do there's a certain instability in in

427
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,200
Portugal uh and we'll see whether they

428
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,679
will move forward following Germany

429
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,759
maybe with that model which is in line

430
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,120
what the European commission actually in

431
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:43,960
the constructive talks with the Germans

432
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,959
have actually asked to

433
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:51,439
do from Portugal to the larger neighbor

434
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,600
Spain um medical cannabis is not yet

435
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,720
regulated in Spain the cultivation of

436
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,639
cannabis for research and medical and

437
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,720
scientific purposes is prohibited and

438
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,919
less authorized of course by the uh

439
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,240
Spanish Agency for medicinal products

440
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,360
and medical

441
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,079
devices um the Ministry of Health

442
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,439
actually announced in February 2024 that

443
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:16,839
had started the progress to develop a

444
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,840
Royal Decree with which it plans to

445
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,599
approve the regulations of medical

446
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:26,720
cannabis so a little bit behind Germany

447
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:31,439
uh all nearly seven years uh but we'll

448
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,679
see what actually will Spain be doing uh

449
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,278
despite that of course as you know in

450
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,960
Spain we have these cannabis

451
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:42,119
clubs great number of Canabis Bloods

452
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,640
where actually you can go and

453
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,119
consume again back to Germany in these

454
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,759
cannabis clubs or cultivation

455
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,599
associations consumptions are allowed

456
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,119
yeah you just what you just can do as a

457
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,918
member you can go there and collect your

458
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,959
weed that's all and have to leave

459
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,880
there's no even no space No Room allowed

460
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,759
where you can actually consume your

461
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,559
cannabis so you have to take it home uh

462
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,400
different of course from the model which

463
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,480
we see in Spain and so it's not

464
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,200
comparable at all the cannabis clubs in

465
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,720
Spain are not comparable to the Cannabis

466
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,000
cultivation associations in Germany and

467
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,558
there are lots of rules and regulations

468
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,079
with regard where you can actually grow

469
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,319
as one of these cannabis clubs here in

470
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,439
Germany uh and uh that will be

471
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,480
interesting to see what the state

472
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,519
government and the communities are

473
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,519
bringing up

474
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
all right to

475
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:39,119
Switzerland Switzerland not being a

476
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,839
member of the European Union actually uh

477
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:46,119
uh has implemented these scientifically

478
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:49,399
controlled pilot projects and you may

479
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,359
have heard about that uh the UN

480
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,519
conventions the various un conventions

481
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:58,959
in particular the UN convention 1961

482
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:03,639
exempts the use and transfer of cannabis

483
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:06,919
or uh cannabis for medical purposes and

484
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,960
of course for scientific purposes and

485
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,440
that is actually what the Germans

486
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,278
anticipated here and have implemented

487
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,880
into the second pillar because as we

488
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:19,960
heard this morning already uh the

489
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,159
legalization process has two pillars

490
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,720
first is hom growth cultivation in clubs

491
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,600
and then of course the second one is the

492
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,919
implementation of scientifically

493
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,359
scientifically controlled pilot projects

494
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,759
very much the same as Switzerland has

495
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:40,278
done that um of course we were expecting

496
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,480
the first draft law on that before

497
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:45,558
Christmas uh even the Easter Bunny

498
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,759
didn't bring it so we'll see when we

499
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:49,960
actually will get the first draft on the

500
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,359
table we know that the Ministries are

501
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,640
working on that uh for the

502
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:58,158
implementation of uh these uh pilot

503
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,559
projects uh we don't know yet whether

504
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,240
this dispensaries will be licensed uh

505
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,759
how to register as a participant in this

506
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,839
pilot project what are the numbers of

507
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,960
pilot projects in which regions do we

508
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,439
have them how many actually can

509
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,558
participate so that is all unknown we

510
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,880
will see that and you course hopefully

511
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,720
uh in order to have the implementation

512
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,640
of the second pillar of that

513
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,679
legalization process which is of course

514
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,919
a step

515
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,080
forward however I think what is uh

516
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:36,000
important

517
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:39,000
to know is uh that U the uh third pillar

518
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,720
uh which nobody actually has recognized

519
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,319
is that the German government is going

520
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,960
to seek uh other countries in Europe to

521
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:52,119
influence the decision-making process at

522
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,960
the European commission level for that

523
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,759
they would like to gain data see what is

524
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,840
the impact of the legalization and once

525
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,960
these data has been gained they will

526
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,359
definitely go to the European Commission

527
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,640
in order to convince them to change the

528
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,918
prohibition policy very important step

529
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,000
nobody's really talking about that uh

530
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,960
but is an important part of that

531
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,919
legalization process uh for that as I

532
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,360
said we need that scientifically

533
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,880
controlled pilot projects in order to

534
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,199
get to gain data and if you look into

535
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,440
Switzerland they have actually these

536
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,440
seven different uh pilot trials as we

537
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,480
call it uh some of them have already

538
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,798
been active some of them are set being

539
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:40,000
set up uh they uh script for example

540
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:44,158
weed care and Turan these are these

541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,359
projects actually PPP uh public private

542
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,360
Partnerships uh together with the

543
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,678
universities who is are going to collect

544
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:55,759
the respective data of the use of

545
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:59,640
cannabis and what kind of impact it may

546
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:02,319
have uh this is the model which Germany

547
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,520
is going to implement to which extent I

548
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,879
can't tell you not I can't tell you at

549
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:09,879
this point in

550
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,720
time so just a couple of words to uh the

551
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,720
Netherlands oo the

552
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,519
Netherlands uh actually uh you know

553
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,960
since 20 since

554
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:24,440
2003 uh medical cannabis was permitted

555
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,840
uh and already back you know in 1976 the

556
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,399
use of recreational Cannabis was

557
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:32,798
permitted uh if you have reached the

558
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,918
legal age so it's a long history of the

559
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,038
use of of Canabis for recreational

560
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,159
purposes we all know this coffee shop uh

561
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:43,079
system where you could actually could

562
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,559
get in and and consume buy and consume

563
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:49,798
cannabis uh which was uh not legalized

564
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:52,720
but it was

565
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:57,000
accepted uh which is

566
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,120
uh speciality of the uh Dutch criminal

567
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,319
law you they can do it in Germany we

568
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,239
couldn't do it we have a different

569
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,759
principle we have to implement and rule

570
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,319
the the respective laws in in the

571
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,558
Netherlands they are following a system

572
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,519
where they can but not have to do that

573
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:17,119
and that's what they did uh actually

574
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:20,839
ignoring the use of cannabis in these

575
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:23,719
coffee shops which were actually illegal

576
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:28,199
um however now they are starting up as

577
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,558
well uh to implement this uh kind of

578
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,240
projects scientifically controlled as

579
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:38,240
well U so there startup phase uh with

580
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,599
respect to that um so the are going to a

581
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,359
certain extent legalize now their copy

582
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:47,119
shop system uh smart move of course also

583
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,959
in the borderlines of the European uh

584
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,158
commission guidelines and of course the

585
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,200
Shen agreement uh and they have as you

586
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:57,760
know licensed out uh to 10 cultivators

587
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,798
in Netherlands to to serve the market uh

588
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,519
with uh cultivated cannabis for

589
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:03,519
recreational

590
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,600
purposes so now we are leaving the

591
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:14,720
European Union and jumping

592
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:16,639
into uh the United Kingdom uh and uh uh

593
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,919
that's kind of very interesting if you

594
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,960
look into the UK CBD market for example

595
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:26,640
you will find a great number of products

596
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,440
and those who are either living there or

597
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,159
who have visited the UK they she have

598
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:37,240
seen all the shops with regard to CBD

599
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:40,440
products uh and uh which are if you look

600
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,880
into the European legislation are not

601
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,200
permitted in particular with regard to

602
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,840
food supplements uh and of course as you

603
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,000
know you know foood supplements

604
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,519
containing CBD CBD which according to

605
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,240
the decision of the European court of

606
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,558
justice is not a narcotic needs a

607
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,679
registration under the novel foot

608
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:02,798
director of the European Union and of

609
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,759
course we have companies who have

610
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,960
applied for that uh and they

611
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,679
applications have been put on hold by

612
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,880
the respective directorate of the

613
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,679
European Commission because the

614
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,919
respective safety data they provided

615
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,759
were not sufficient so they have asked

616
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,600
for more data and more data and again

617
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:26,759
for more data and now all the applicants

618
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:30,359
who are left over I think of 50 are

619
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:32,798
around 35 which have uh formed groups in

620
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:35,879
order to get the uh

621
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,960
costs actually divided between them for

622
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,240
gaining those data uh are would say

623
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,600
frustrated by that

624
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,278
approach uh in the United Kingdom uh

625
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:50,398
there this if you look into the medical

626
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,640
Market it's a very limited market uh

627
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,639
very limited market with regard to the

628
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,480
indications and very limited market with

629
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,799
regard to who actually can prescribe uh

630
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:05,640
the respect Ive uh uh Medical

631
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:09,798
Products um if you look over into what's

632
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:12,038
going to happen here uh there's a leaked

633
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:15,079
report for a pilot project for

634
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:18,640
decriminalization of cannabis well we'll

635
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:20,879
see what it will bring actually um and

636
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,919
of course the mayor the office of the

637
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,919
mayor of London is up to reelection in

638
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,360
May this year so just shortly and in

639
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:33,720
we'll see what actually this has as an

640
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,959
impact on the new cannabis uh

641
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,798
legislation they are looking forward

642
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,480
though it's all connected of course to

643
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:44,278
politics our Chancellor in China the

644
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,038
mayor in London having elections you

645
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:49,359
know it is the the law is made by

646
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,119
politicians and that's where we have

647
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:56,519
actually to Lobby

648
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:59,239
that so if you look into uh in Scotland

649
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:02,599
uh it is interesting course uh uh in

650
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:06,720
Scotland the ruling uh is that of the of

651
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:10,558
the Scottish Lal party uh they advocated

652
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,360
uh a kind of a decolonization of drugs

653
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,398
including cannabis Scotland has one of

654
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:19,319
the highest drug death rates in Europe I

655
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:23,119
didn't know that before I went into uh

656
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,798
the investigation of that and uh we

657
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,239
hopefully will see a change in the

658
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:31,918
policy approach and a kind of a deiz

659
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,798
probably to the back door as outlined

660
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,240
here so coming to the end of my

661
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:40,798
presentation let's have a look where do

662
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,599
we stand here and today in Germany and

663
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,119
in

664
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:47,240
Europe the legalization for medical

665
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:49,359
cannabis and recreational purposes gains

666
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,679
momentum in Europe I think that is clear

667
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:55,519
everybody is getting into the discussion

668
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,399
of legalization of medical cannabis I

669
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,120
had the pleasure to be invited to

670
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,479
Slovenia to speak before the National

671
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,518
Council about the legal legalization

672
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,558
process in Germany uh of course starting

673
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:12,200
with medical and uh there are other

674
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:14,519
countries not only Slovenia but also uh

675
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,278
in the uh in Czech Republic for example

676
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,558
in other parts of the European Union who

677
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:21,558
are looking at what is Germany doing and

678
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:24,879
as such it may have a pulling effect

679
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:27,519
they are looking into more and more uh

680
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,440
uh legalization at least for medical uh

681
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,159
it's not legalized in each and every

682
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,120
country of the European Union and of

683
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,720
course we should actually try to get at

684
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,278
least the harmonization within the

685
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,880
European Union at least for medical and

686
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,880
earlier or later also for

687
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:51,639
recreational the obstacle as we know uh

688
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,919
is uh the the shenen convention and the

689
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:58,038
EU Council framework decision of

690
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:00,720
2004 uh and of course the various single

691
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:04,679
conventions to which the European Union

692
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,038
actually uh uh is also a party and a

693
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:11,759
such very reluctant to allow member

694
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,759
states to go forward with a full

695
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,839
legalization so if we look into the

696
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,558
political challenges and we heard that

697
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:26,079
this morning as well from from gor uh

698
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:26,079
there are of course uh in all

699
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,440
countries part ities groups which are

700
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:37,638
strictly against the legalization of

701
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,720
cannabis U not only for recreational but

702
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,439
also for cl for medical

703
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,240
purposes um also in Germany and we have

704
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,600
to say that very clearly the opposition

705
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,638
are very very clearly said that they

706
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:55,240
were against the legalization Pro and

707
00:33:50,638 --> 00:34:01,599
they are still of that opinion today so

708
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:03,240
the more we go forward the more uh we

709
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,319
step into a

710
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,480
legalization uh and the

711
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,398
more experience we will have the more

712
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,398
data we will have with the

713
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:17,679
legalization uh the better the arguments

714
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:19,719
are to me to do the next

715
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,440
step and

716
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:28,638
nevertheless uh I'm convinced that more

717
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:31,878
countries in Europe will go that path

718
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,800
and as such our legalization in Germany

719
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:37,199
wasn't all that bad I think it's a good

720
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,960
step forward even if it's not the full

721
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,439
legalization which we

722
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,440
expected thank you very

723
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,240
much Peter humberg Peter Humber I think

724
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:53,078
we have time for a question or two maybe

725
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:58,479
if there's a question does anyone have a

726
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,480
question all right Derek has a question

727
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,078
thank thank you my question is about the

728
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,919
talks that the German government said

729
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,680
they had with the European commission

730
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,639
what's unclear to me is there's no name

731
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:13,399
of who they talk to there's no date

732
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:16,679
there is no official release has there

733
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,440
really been this discussion can you tell

734
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,759
a bit more about that is there a

735
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,400
discussion yes there was a discussion I

736
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,720
I I believe our minister of Health that

737
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,838
he's telling the truth on that uh it is

738
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:33,118
and was not not a formal process there

739
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:37,719
was no there is no process in order to

740
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,160
get the opinion or to get the uh the

741
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,919
confirmation of the European commission

742
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,598
that we can go forward it was an

743
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,920
informal Talk of the ministry and uh the

744
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,960
group who wanted to do the legalization

745
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,318
to a full extent uh and I don't know to

746
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,838
whom they talk uh of course probably to

747
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:58,480
the directorate of which is responsible

748
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,880
for the pharmaceutical developments but

749
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,519
uh it is indeed not even published it

750
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,358
just said they were constructive talks

751
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,039
with the European commission and I said

752
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,000
as I said before I have a little bit of

753
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,358
a different understanding what

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,119
constructive really means uh but that

755
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:17,639
is between us they have been feared

756
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,960
away they could have of course gone

757
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,480
forward with a legalization process uh

758
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,039
they could have not been stopped but of

759
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,559
course they could have been actually uh

760
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,719
sued before the European court of

761
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,239
justice and Germany just lost two large

762
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,799
cases before the European court of

763
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,199
justice so they were afraid of another

764
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,560
one from my point of view and that's the

765
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,799
reason why we have this twostep

766
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,719
legalization process Which is far away

767
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,720
from the total

768
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,039
legalization all right uh oh you have to

769
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,480
jump we have we have time for one more

770
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,759
I'm glad I wore comfortable shoes uh

771
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,599
I'll remind you also that there's

772
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,599
microphones back there

773
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,429
[Music]

774
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:05,639
hi Peter um I guess my question is

775
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,160
regarding pillar two in Germany what are

776
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,759
in your opinion what are the chances

777
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,960
that it gets passed and implemented

778
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:16,119
prior to the October 2025

779
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:21,559
election that's a let me see crystal

780
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:24,358
ball uh there is a if the opposition uh

781
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:27,880
the conservative parties would

782
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:30,279
succeed um they have

783
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,760
made statements uh since the

784
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,960
legalization even before that they would

785
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,960
like to reverse it whether they really

786
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,440
will do that is another question you

787
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,119
know we're not in Thailand uh this is a

788
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,079
democracy and of course there are

789
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,920
different opinions about uh the

790
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:51,560
legalization process um from my point of

791
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,159
view it would be difficult to totally

792
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:56,920
reverse that legalization

793
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,519
without uh getting at least a

794
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,920
significant

795
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:04,800
uh uh significant strong opinion against

796
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,599
it to say it in more diplomatic way more

797
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,599
diplomatic than all of schs yesterday in

798
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,318
China so difficult to say uh I don't

799
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,559
believe Frankly Speaking that they will

800
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:19,199
totally reverse that that legalization

801
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:22,799
uh which is which is from my point of

802
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:25,759
view uh already uh as you would say

803
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,440
written in stone at least sorry my

804
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:34,720
question was pillar two oh pillar two oh

805
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,880
sorry yeah yeah there you go yes all

806
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,919
