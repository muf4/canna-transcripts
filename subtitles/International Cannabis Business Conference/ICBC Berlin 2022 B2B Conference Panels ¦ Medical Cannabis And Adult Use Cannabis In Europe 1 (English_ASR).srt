53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,959
been active in the market since 2018 and

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,959
the inception of the medical market

55
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
and after an initial kind of interest in

56
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,199
music thomas first founded his first

experience in software development

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,920
but due to kind of the the cannabis

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,560
opportunity decided to

61
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,958
leave that role and snap our ceo role to

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,878
join 420 farm farmer

64
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,719
how much you've had over here and

65
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,439

and the research and agency also have a

79
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,039
lot of experience to share with us today

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,199
they've got very deep insight into

81
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,280
cannabis use among patients and among

82
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,878
the quality of products they want to

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
test them for virtually so they're

84
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,239
pretty much in and out of these products

85
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,119
day in and day out so

86
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
really

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,719
joined by this panel and yeah looking

88
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,878
forward to getting stuck in so

89
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,239
i guess we are going to kick things off

90
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,959
it would be great to hear a bit about

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
how

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,360
you think the medical market will be

93
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,799
affected by legalization in germany and

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
whether you think it will continue to

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,799
grow as we've seen or there'll be some

96
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,560
sort of shift uh when recreational

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,319
access opens

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
yeah hello everybody

99
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,958
yeah what will happen to the medical

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,680
market uh in the moment the naval market

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,360
is well developed in germany i think

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,040
since 2017 it's a good development

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
it is the same development what has

104
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,840
happened in many countries first there

105
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,640
was a medical market and afterwards

106
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,080
there

107
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,798
started the discussions about

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,560
recreational and so it has more or less

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
paved the way in direction of

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,878
recreational

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,479
we can assume today that a certain

112
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,039
amount of people

113
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,840
inside the medical system

114
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,438
maybe would drop out if there would be a

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,640
legal alternative

116
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,079
available yeah at the same time when

117
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,759
discussions are

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
about kinetics

119
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,478
because more broad available there will

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,078
be new patients also available maybe

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,039
also resistance

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,360
to prescribe will will come down in the

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,879
moment we see the most restrictions in

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,520
the cannabis market by missing a doctor

125
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,800
soviet greece crisis who really believe

126
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,639
in canada's

127
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,319
as a medicine

128
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,240
so overall

129
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,599
although we have seen like in canada we

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,840
have seen that the

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,560
medical market is went down i don't

132
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,799
think this is necessarily the case in

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,959
germany because the medical market is

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
not so big at the moment we have seen

135
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,039
the numbers this morning uh

136
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,039
many people believed 800 thousand

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,199
patients would be available and we have

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
not even half of them

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
at the moment

140
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,918
so

141
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,000
i only believe that the market overall

142
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,478
all the medieval market will grow

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,879
the problem but also was several times

144
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,800
discussed this morning is the supply

145
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:14,000
what will people do will there be enough

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
supply for the medical market

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,079
at the double standards they discussed

148
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
now yeah of course for the for a

149
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,000
producer if you can

150
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,240
get maybe more easy to

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
to grow a recreational cannabis instead

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,879
of medieval canals of course you may

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
would switch to this to this side and

154
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,918
but

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,720
yeah overall i think for the government

156
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,839
it must be a priority that

157
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,160
the medical market is first served and

158
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,799
then the recreational market itself a

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,199
patient who really needs the medicine

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,400
who needs it daily to handle his pain or

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,199
whatever

162
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,560
must be a priority for the government

163
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,560
before a recreational user can enjoy

164
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,918
his canels

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,839
thank you and i think you raised some

166
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,680
interesting questions there around

167
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,359
where supply will come from how the kind

168
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,199
of framework will look

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
thomas i guess from your experience

170
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,960
working with distribution with

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,399
regulators so far

172
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,638
how do you kind of think that

173
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,839
legalization may look in germany and how

174
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,038
do you think

175
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,879
things are going to how do you think

176
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,399
things will proceed going forwards and

177
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,159
do you have any sort of a vision of

178
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,120
where we could be going

179
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,720
so after we heard some uh keynote from

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,879
our uh book at leaner here in the panel

181
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
i'm pretty sure that they will have a

182
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,439
very strong look at the medical market

183
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,599
and the experience we

184
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,519
just collected in the last five years

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
and i'm pretty sure they will be very

186
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,240
open towards that topic because the time

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,079
is very very right i guess you see this

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
all over the world to spreading cannabis

189
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,198
as a new market even for medical and

190
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,000
recreational purposes but

191
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,639
it's very um dangerous to have this

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
double standard stuff and uh for example

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,918
the medical market is very important

194
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,879
that the research and development

195
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,439
continues because you definitely have to

196
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,360
differentiate your product portfolio

197
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,279
between reg market and medical market

198
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,879
because at the moment you have lots of

199
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,359
strains in the market

200
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,519
and you sometimes have the problem so

201
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,759
what is the exact cure of that strain

202
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,799
and opposite to another strain and that

203
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,560
is the fact why a lot of doctors refuse

204
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,120
from that topic and i'm pretty sure that

205
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,038
they will have a very very

206
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,680
open discussion for grant market and

207
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,680
both markets will uh work together very

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
aligned i guess because research and

209
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
development will be more in the medical

210
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,598
market and experience in the field will

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
be more coming up from wreck mark

212
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,598
because the volume is much bigger there

213
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,639
so i'm guessing um yeah they will be

214
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,319
have a very very certain

215
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,879
framework in the wreck market which is

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,400
very very uh nearby the medical market

217
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,639
and then after

218
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,478
four years maybe and you see what is

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,120
really going on in the red market you

220
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,680
can maybe adjust this a little bit

221
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
thank you i think yeah this is quite a

222
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,360
little clear that while there are some

223
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,680
great advantages and

224
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,199
experiences to gain from pivoting

225
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
medical questions to recreation there

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,720
does need to be a really clear mind and

227
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,479
i think that's been echoed by everything

228
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,120
i've been hearing today

229
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,038
and above i guess speaking about the

230
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,959
current medical framework in itself

231
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,759
something you've been working with and

232
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,239
kind of

233
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,120
uh doing activism for over the last 20

234
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,478
years

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,560
do you think that the current kind of

236
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,878
pharma framework is meeting the needs of

237
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,879
patients and do you think

238
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,120
it's easy enough to kind of access the

239
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,199
natural remedies and to access

240
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,759
um the type products and the formats

241
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,519
that patients want

242
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,838
not really i can talk

243
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,440
for slovenia where the bureaucratic

244
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,560
obstacles are

245
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,000
as severe as maybe in germany

246
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,479
we have no

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,120
medical cannabis approved since five

248
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,278
years but you can probably find a doctor

249
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,278
in slovenia who will prescribe it and

250
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,759
even if they prescribe it legally they

251
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,159
can propose all the medical chambers and

252
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,679
they just want to avoid it

253
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,759
the problem

254
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,479
for this medical part because i would

255
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,919
not mix personal use of so-called

256
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,000
recreational

257
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,559
use of cannabis is not recreation it's a

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,360
personal use we don't have recreational

259
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:16,559
mining no

260
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,240
but i think the education is crucial to

261
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,359
get doctors

262
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,839
on the

263
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
cannabis side

264
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,640
because

265
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,360
they need protocols they need you know

266
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,639
everything around because they

267
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,959
and it's a quite individual approach so

268
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,679
in slovenia it's hard to find doctor

269
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,079
today even if it is they can prescribe

270
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,000
flowers they can describe everything

271
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,639
but everything is more or less on

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,639
satellites

273
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,199
and cbd

274
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:52,720
this is what's allowed by slovenian

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,720
public agency for drugs

276
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,719
therefore we started already four years

277
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,480
ago

278
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,639
educational program

279
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,039
all together also with medical chamber

280
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,439
of slovenia nurses chamber slovenia we

281
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,000
organize already

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
actually three education courses for

283
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,039
doctors

284
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,200
and i hope this will bring some changes

285
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,519
onto this field

286
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,879
fantastic thank you and i guess moving

287
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,278
on to kind of what legalization means to

288
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,360
operators into businesses themselves

289
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,078
such as a lot of people here

290
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,639
and what kind of does legalization mean

291
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,559
for your stores

292
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,480
i mean one of the things i find quite

293
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,838
interesting about you guys is you're one

294
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,839
of the only kind of

295
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
bit of businesses that have got proven

296
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,839
revenues from medical you've got a deep

297
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,720
understanding of consumers both kind of

298
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,360
in the recreational space uh overseas

299
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
alongside a medical kind of the german

300
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
space

301
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,320
and i guess from that position how do

302
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
you see

303
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,040
things shifting through stores of

304
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,639
bicycle and how do you see your

305
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,439
consumers and revenues being affected

306
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,600
yeah

307
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,640
um i say i think we are a little bit

308
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,800
cautious about uh our expectations uh we

309
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,278
are already in business as you mentioned

310
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,399
yeah we are distributing them to more

311
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,879
than 100 countries uh in the year

312
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,879
yeah we are available with

313
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,439
what we call hostile devices well the

314
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,679
intended uses of chamomile and such

315
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,959
things and we have the major products

316
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,399
where the intelligence is for kennedy

317
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,479
nights

318
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
but we think once this legalized of

319
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,278
course you will have a

320
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
push

321
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,240
always hit at least at the beginning

322
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,600
you will have more information available

323
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,839
therefore we will

324
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,000
should we reach more clients but we

325
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
don't believe that our business will be

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,639
have a little skyrocket because of

327
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,039
legalization in germany there's as

328
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,319
mentioned already a good business

329
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,679
in germany

330
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,519
and

331
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,078
and so if you look to the to the rest of

332
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,759
the world of course there it can be if

333
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,479
you look to canada to experience there

334
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,720
of course here there was improvement in

335
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,360
but also not too much and many times

336
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,079
this legalization it also comes with a

337
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,399
lot of regulation who you have not in

338
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,159
place before you know of course we

339
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,399
cannot in a moment do advertising for

340
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,120
cannabis but we can do

341
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,679
advertisement with life science

342
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,759
stuff and things but once like in canada

343
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,078
then you are not allowed to

344
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,319
for example to show your products or you

345
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,000
must

346
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,440
must your products bring to it that

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
you're not usable you're taking a better

348
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,240
result so you cannot turn them on in a

349
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,200
shop and and and things like that

350
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,680
so overall we see um this legitimization

351
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,600
because government there's so much fear

352
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,000
about it and so they think about all

353
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,159
this what we all hear today about yours

354
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,919
uh protection about uh consumer

355
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,039
protection and then these fees then at

356
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,240
the end of the

357
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:52,799
of the day uh you cannot even show where

358
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,240
you can get your cannabis from yeah even

359
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,479
you they even think about having um

360
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,919
at the state distributing in their own

361
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,240
shops you know what you have in the

362
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,599
model of quebec for example yeah if you

363
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,879
look to grab

364
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,360
the government

365
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,039
by themselves and there's for example no

366
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,759
weaponries available at all in their

367
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,679
shops yeah because they they don't think

368
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,639
this is necessary yeah so there are only

369
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,278
also devices available so overall which

370
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,799
legalization also can come additional

371
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,039
difficulties

372
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,120
for for the business

373
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,519
so overall we will have

374
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
some improvement in business but

375
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
not skyrocketing

376
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,679
thank you so much very very valuable

377
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,119
insights

378
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,120
um

379
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
you mentioned the product differences as

380
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,560
well the difference in your kind of

381
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,639
portfolio that you might need to stop

382
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,399
from medical and recreational do you

383
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,039
expect to see any kind of overlap of

384
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
products and suppliers or do you expect

385
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,559
this to be a completely separate thing

386
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,040
completely grounds for that format

387
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,239
no because because i thought as i said

388
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,319
at the beginning i'm pretty sure that

389
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,320
the politics will be very aligned

390
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,880
foreign supplier for medical and

391
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,879
suppliers or rate markets to be

392
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,919
something in the same

393
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,159
but

394
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,559
to answer the question i'm pretty sure

395
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,399
that from from the product side in the

396
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,679
medical market what i really mean is you

397
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,839
have to develop a real medicinal product

398
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,838
to to get all the doctors on board

399
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
because at the moment i would guess

400
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
maybe two three four percent of the

401
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,919
doctors in germany prescribe cannabis

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,559
and all the others say okay give me some

403
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,278
data and that is for example the reason

404
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,359
why we as a company do not hire as much

405
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,198
farmer sales guys as we could because

406
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
what should they tell the doctors they

407
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,078
come to the place and say yeah this is

408
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,759
cannabis and what's the difference

409
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,599
between that

410
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,078
it's another strain and has another

411
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,320
turbine profile but the the real data

412
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,559
based medicinal standard

413
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,639
we are far away from that so and we

414
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,518
definitely have to put more and more

415
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,159
effort

416
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,159
into that to really create a medicinal

417
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,078
product which more and more doctors can

418
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,078
prescribe because they are responsible

419
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,559
for that and when i would be a doctor i

420
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,319
would be very interested in the fact

421
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,799
what exactly will happen to my patient

422
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,360
when i'm describing this kind of product

423
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,719
and i think the wreck market when this

424
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,919
is coming up

425
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,959
and the

426
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,838
topic cannabis as such is spread among

427
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,479
the

428
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,920
whole society i guess then more and more

429
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
doctors maybe

430
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,879
put away their doubts about cannabis and

431
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,120
be more open into and and do more

432
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,799
research and stuff like that and so um

433
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,679
this will be a very crucial process

434
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,319
during the whole great market opening

435
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,039
fantastic thank you so much and

436
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,360
i guess a kind of closing question

437
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,480
as uh as well as kind of the impacts on

438
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,919
companies

439
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,278
of the industry

440
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,120
at the bottom line of this there is

441
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,679
quite a big fundamental human rights

442
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,078
question this is it's not just any sort

443
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,559
of product this is like a human right

444
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,000
noise to be able to consume calories and

445
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,359
to be able to enjoy that as giving

446
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,399
personal use

447
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,919
and i think

448
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
there's been a lot of activism as we

449
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,360
pioneered and i think

450
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
that's been a huge role in getting the

451
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,278
medical market off the ground

452
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,360
and i think do you see a place for more

453
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,439
recreational activism how do you think

454
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,399
that kind of civil disobedience and

455
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,600
these forms of activity can help to kind

456
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,039
of progress

457
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,920
the cause and help achieve some of these

458
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,879
aims that we will be talking about

459
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,519
of course the use of cannabis special

460
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,759
for medical purposes and purposes is a

461
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,039
basic human right you know because we

462
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,159
have enough data that we cannot just ban

463
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,919
it and

464
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,319
take it off

465
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,240
of the table

466
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,360
but i really think we should divide

467
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,480
medical market and personal use

468
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,120
because for personal use i think

469
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,600
we don't have to invent hot water again

470
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,639
we have regulated alcohol everything

471
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,360
what is needed we have huge

472
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,919
because of alcohol and everything so

473
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,959
just copy paste and i think it's

474
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:05,279
regulated more than enough alcohol also

475
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:08,720
domestic use and domestic

476
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:12,078
brewery it's very hard to regulate so i

477
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,919
think we should apply something similar

478
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,279
for this

479
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,360
and medical market

480
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,000
rules are completely different different

481
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,639
laws different approach so we can i

482
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,919
don't think we can mix those two

483
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,840
fields you know in one past

484
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,799
years

485
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,918
so

486
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:36,720
unfortunately i have to tell you that

487
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,759
around 15 percent of slovenians are

488
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,038
using cannabis on daily basis that's

489
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,759
that's a lot and we cannot look away

490
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:45,759
and

491
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,679
now actually patients are forcing

492
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:51,919
doctors to prescribe cannabis because

493
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
patients are also well educated

494
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,480
especially when they are

495
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,798
you know very sick or they need really

496
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,880
help so

497
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,918
in slovenia without the survey of

498
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,000
faculty of social sciences 30 percent of

499
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
oncological patients are also with

500
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,679
candidates

501
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,159
and i think this is not really good for

502
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
credibility of the

503
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,279
medical

504
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,279
societies are the same

505
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,639
you know so i think this should be

506
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,678
changed

507
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
and

508
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,798
the crucial of the personal market or

509
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,519
personal use market

510
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,720
is

511
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:31,599
quality control we have quality control

512
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,279
now for our last eight years

513
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,918
and it should really be controlled as

514
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,558
it should be for cannabis because now

515
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,120
is the worst thing where you can buy

516
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,119
whatever

517
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,440
[Music]

518
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,200
fantastic thank you and i guess just

519
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,360
just wrapping up now as we are close to

520
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,038
time i'd like to offer everyone everyone

521
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,479
the same question is there an ideal

522
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,160
scenario where

523
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,240
everyone can win the industry

524
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,279
governments the recreational users the

525
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,558
patients

526
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,319
operators

527
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,240
um and i know it's quite a broad

528
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,639
question but in a nutshell do you think

529
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,519
that's possible

530
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,600
of course it's possible uh maybe we

531
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,798
should invest a little bit more into

532
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,038
education

533
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,599
not just the research because this is

534
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,759
most research planned on the planet

535
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,319
you know but i think we should

536
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:27,119
put more effort to education and things

537
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,879
will change soon

538
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,639
perfect words i cannot add some more

539
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
because education is the crucial point

540
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,480
here in this case especially for

541
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,359
cannabis market and

542
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,519
yeah

543
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,199
if we achieve to have a very good

544
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,960
education base and

545
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
acceptance within the society i think

546
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,720
there could be a win-win situation for

547
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,558
all relevant players in the market

548
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,558
yeah i think in the center of the wind

549
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,359
you must be the patient and the consumer

550
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,918
of course it's available so for the

551
00:19:53,359 --> 00:20:00,000
government it is important to make it as

552
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,840
easy as possible be as no or as

553
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,079
few regulations as possible in the

554
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,839
moment there's still all this this fear

555
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,439
and then also

556
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,199
[Music]

557
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
and all these things i think you can

558
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,480
treat this much much easier and and if

559
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,159
you look to a congress where they have

560
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,159
legalized it you see the negative

561
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,919
consequences are men enough and they are

562
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,400
definitely lower than the consequences

563
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,520
of prohibition so i would say the more

564
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,679
liberal the approach is the better it is

565
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,158
fantastic and thank you so much for

566
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,320
coming that was the end of the panel

567
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,480
i just want to say thank you to all of

568
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,480
your parents

569
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:45,638
