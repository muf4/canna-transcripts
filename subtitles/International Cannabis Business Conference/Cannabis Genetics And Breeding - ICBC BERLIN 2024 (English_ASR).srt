this um yeah so we wanted to just get

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,718
the conversation started uh on genetics

25
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,519
you know there's it's one of the main

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,280
main things that you know Growers uh

27
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,798
think about talk about you know when

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,599
starting an operation it's one of the

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,400
main things that uh they need to keep in

30
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,759
mind right so yeah let's uh we we'll

31

um the commissioner for Big League

35
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:29,719
genetics uh we are a licensed Nursery in

36
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,118
Canada uh we've been selling genetics

37
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,959
for for the last 3 years across the

38
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:36,200
country and now I'm super proud to say

39
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,879
that we uh completed our first export to

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,560
Germany uh we spent 17 genetics over to

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:45,039
deman um yeah we're pretty excited about

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,840
it um on top of our Nursery program

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,520
we've also got a 20,000 ft cultivation

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,880
facility where we run our feno Hunts uh

45
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,879
we grow our we have to you know walk our

46
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,078
talk we we run a lot of our genetics on

47
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,078
a regular basis commercially and we

48
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,000
export that flour to uh Germany to

49
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:05,758
Australia happy to be here excited about

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,319
it right on um Matthew donus from the VP

of sales and business development for

52
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,799
SRA International we're a tissue culture

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,000
uh company with u molecular Lab Services

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,160
as well so we work with amazing breeders

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,479
from all over the world and we uh bring

56
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,400
their plants in vitro uh tissue culture

57
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,238
them uh we DNA fingerprint them so

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,239
they're true to type and we can monitor

59
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,280
the stability of the genetics in an in

60
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,000
vitro State and we shipped to I think

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,680
eight countries right now and we've got

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,080
three more countries coming online very

to my customer to get the maximum

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,759
potential of the cultiv awesome thank

84
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,958
you and my my name is Juan Gutierrez I'm

85
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,919
uh I'm a consultant uh now been a

86
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,680
consultant for four years uh but I've

87
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,839
been growing cannabis professionally in

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,360
Canada for for some time now um started

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,719
back in 2013 uh managed some big

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,000
facilities out there kept expanding our

91
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,759
company was bought out by Aurora

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,919
cannabis um and then yeah now we're

93
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,959
Consulting uh we're building facilities

94
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:48,318
all over the world uh helping Growers

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,799
improve their facilities um so yeah so

96
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,199
I'm let's say A customer from these guys

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,920
you know I go to companies like SRA like

98
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,238
you know Big League we're looking for

99
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,399
genetics you know so for me it's it's

100
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm more on the client side let's say so

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,039
I guess one of the the the first things

102
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,438
that I wanted to ask you guys what's

103
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,840
what what are what are you seeing right

104
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,400
now that are the most important factors

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,719
uh when Growers go out and looking for

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,438
genetics you know is THC still kind of

107
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,720
like that main thing you know how has it

108
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,519
changed now hi THC every time all the

109
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
time like it's it's an unfortunate

110
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,360
reality that's kind of going on the

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,520
market right now um but yeah high THC

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,240
has always been the driving force of

113
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,719
genetics and genetic purchasing um

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,280
questions when you get asked oh you got

115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,960
something over 30% yeah we got something

116
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,359
over 30% um but now we're really

117
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,198
starting especially in more like markets

118
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,520
like

119
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,199
Canada um more data on the genetics is

120
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,799
is more important and guys are starting

121
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,800
to ask better questions than just hey

122
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,879
what's the THC potency on this now it

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,439
comes down to yield bag appeal Tarpin

124
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,478
all super important um yield per plant

125
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,759
how they

126
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,719
perform yeah absolutely I can agree more

127
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,038
I mean high THC is unfortunately still

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,240
driving uh the Global Market and it it

129
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,560
it really doesn't make uh a heck of a

130
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,840
lot of sense I think the liquor board

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,478
kind of uh needed a

132
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:13,399
quantifiable uh number to associate some

133
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:16,199
sort of uh price Matrix on but um yeah

134
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,318
uh like Dave was saying yield data

135
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,560
flower samples everything it's it's the

136
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,080
full kitten Kaboodle multiple uh

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
commercial runs stability of the

138
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,198
genetics and also mitigating any sort of

139
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,879
economic risk I mean plant tissue

140
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,120
culture is is the way to do that because

141
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,560
if you're starting with clean genetics

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,918
you know your plant aren't you know

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,839
infected with any sort of intracellular

144
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,318
bacteria

145
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:38,359
contamination uh ferium pium you name it

146
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,560
um as kind of your mother plants uh grow

147
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,800
on and so keeping those freshes is

148
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,600
important yeah totally agree with my

149
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,079
colleagues I think the same the TC is uh

150
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,879
the most demanded uh requirement in in a

151
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:56,159
string I think the the the demand of the

152
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,519
of the of the market is changing for the

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,280
terpine profile but right now the t is

154
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,399
the most is the most death thing no in

155
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,399
the in the Cannabis industry yeah

156
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,638
unfortunately but you know we we do a

157
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,719
lot of work in Thailand for example

158
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,879
we've been building quite a few

159
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,840
facilities out there I've been traveling

160
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,399
to Thailand in the past year and a half

161
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,758
I've been there quite a bit and and I

162
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,359
see now there that the focus is not so

163
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,038
much THC anymore but let's say tpping

164
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,598
profiles and you know how does the

165
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,478
flower look what is the effect like you

166
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:24,839
know you go to dispensaries out there

167
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,560
and it's like okay what kind of vibe are

168
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,959
you looking for for example as opposed

169
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,720
to you know how high do you want to get

170
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,959
whatever no what are you doing today and

171
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,720
then we'll help you choose something to

172
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,560
to go with that for example right so I

173
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,199
think little by little as you know

174
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,680
there's more markets open up I think

175
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,639
there's going to be kind of you know

176
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,680
changes in that and hopefully I mean you

177
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,759
can see it also in the west coast uh in

178
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,319
the US too that THC is kind of like

179
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,598
starting to be less and less important

180
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,840
but tpping profile tping percent for

181
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:52,360
example you know that's I think and as a

182
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:54,279
grower for example you know I'm not

183
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,680
looking only at the the the final

184
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,679
product but also you know yield for

185
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,879
example looking at if I'm growing in a

186
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,319
greenhouse for example okay well how is

187
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,080
how does it uh behave you know in a

188
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,280
certain cultivation system or if I'm

189
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,839
growing Outdoors for example is it is it

190
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,399
let's say for example you know adapted

191
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,000
to certain environments things like that

192
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,399
so of course there's many different

193
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,800
things I guess but yeah I mean

194
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,239
ultimately it's it's it's quite a shame

195
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,400
and I'm sure Dave would agree with me

196
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,560
but um you know this race to to breed

197
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,000
towards high THC is you know we're

198
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,598
losing and diluting a lot of the amazing

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,959
traits and characteristics of and

200
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:31,159
morphologies of these plants and you

201
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:34,079
know I've smoked uh cannabis that is 16%

202
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,039
that is heck of a lot stronger uh on the

203
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,800
advocacy wise than uh than anything

204
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:43,240
that's 30 plus and really people need to

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,639
to to kind of go away from this high THC

206
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Matrix and and really look at the uh the

207
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,639
full effect because the reality is is

208
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,918
that everybody's andoc canono system uh

209
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,519
processes and and metabolizes cannabis

210
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,560
differently and uh you know 16% to one

211
00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:00,120
person and 30% to the other you know

212
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,519
could have the same balancing effects um

213
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,959
for sure awesome so yeah so Jose in in

214
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,758
in Europe you know you said you've been

215
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,120
working here for quite quite some time

216
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,960
you know in the seat game things like

217
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,439
that so what do you think here in Europe

218
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,120
specifically what do people look for in

219
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,959
terms of the right genetic for example

220
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
and and for a grower why is it important

221
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,878
to have this kind of information from

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
the beginning let's say okay about

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,520
select the right gen from the start

224
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,360
there are sepal reasons starting with h

225
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,399
we need sell a product with some

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,199
characteristic that the customer is is

227
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:32,838
looking for and the and the and

228
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,839
or or our Target in the market is no I

229
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,200
always say that is a key factor the

230
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,399
genetics more than other parameters in a

231
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,680
big in a big percentage we can make for

232
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,679
example a right irrigation strategy or

233
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,439
we can give the right nutrition with

234
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:53,599
nutrients for example but we want reach

235
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,720
30% THC with a genetic of 15% th so yeah

236
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,200
make a good choice I think is crucial

237
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,959
for for get the Suess in this business

238
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,879
and about the most demand strs I will

239
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,278
speak first about the black market

240
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,519
because already SE in Spain for example

241
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,039
there is a demand of top quality without

242
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,879
top quality requirements non stabilized

243
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,838
seeds uh in bulk in a lot of cases with

244
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:19,200
a very low price uh what are the more

245
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,720
demanded the obvious no fast flowering

246
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,240
easy to grow with a good geld flavors

247
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,959
and state in this kind of market usually

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,560
AR needed because the price per ground

249
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:30,278
will be the same sadly in fact it's very

250
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,559
common that

251
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:36,480
the use of synthetic pgrs to increase

252
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:39,000
the yield but they are looking the the

253
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,560
the the the good quality no in the

254
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,720
flower about H Growers yes I see a

255
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,639
change in the Demand right now they are

256
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,480
looking for the hype of new strains C

257
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:52,039
winners high THC contain a specific t

258
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,519
pin or Str good for extractions also the

259
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,679
autoflowering string I think is a a

260
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,919
piece of the market no uh because

261
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,239
several reasons no for example the the

262
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,559
quality is better than a few years ago

263
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,079
and also for example they can make

264
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,439
different Harvest during the season

265
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:10,599
during the summer and has fresh product

266
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,760
in the in the summer no on the other

267
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
hand uh about the legal Market they are

268
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,319
demanding a faster transition to a more

269
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,920
professionalized sector they need like

270
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,278
my colleague said before no as a

271
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,759
fundamental requirement a clear

272
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,360
identification quality protocols and

273
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,240
talking about characteristics in the

274
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,800
genetics the bigger offer in the market

275
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,720
I think is between 15 to 25 but of

276
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:36,359
course TC is the most demanded if you

277
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,519
have 30 is better than 25 not right now

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,959
uh something that I see in each uh

279
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,759
country I travel no uh for example I I

280
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,039
think the the market goes in the good

281
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,399
direction looking for a better thin

282
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:51,278
profile like you know for medical propos

283
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,320
the TC is not the more important thing

284
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,078
in our string and the same in

285
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,480
recreational no in Malta Island for

286
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,838
example the the main goal for producers

287
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,159
is get the maximum TC because he the

288
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,079
most demanded WID in the club no but uh

289
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,799
there is also demanding strengths with

290
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:11,039
lower amount of TAC with less cative

291
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:13,639
efforts ratios one one or with other

292
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,039
compounds like happen with panak and tcv

293
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:20,600
or TVG I think well it's it's other

294
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:23,360
other important uh piece of the market

295
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,360
no awesome thank you yeah thank you yeah

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
absolutely I can agree more with the um

297
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,720
you know drive towards balanced genetics

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,839
or or rare cannaboids you know we've

299
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,959
been onboarding a number of kind of

300
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:39,519
unique genetics for for apis and uh

301
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:43,559
applications like that high tcv uh thcv

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,759
genetics CVG CBN um but there's a a

303
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,679
market for that as well yeah yeah right

304
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,240
on cool so we talked about what you know

305
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,319
let's say what Growers want or the

306
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,120
consumer wants but you know from a from

307
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,440
a cultivation perspective let's say what

308
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,959
some of the some of the things that you

309
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,839
want to avoid you know there's many ways

310
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,518
to get genetics you know you can trade

311
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,320
clones with somebody seeds do your own

312
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,879
feno H things like that but you know

313
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,920
what are some of the main issues Matt

314
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,120
that that you're seeing that you're

315
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,958
trying to avoid with bringing in

316
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,360
genetics to facilities I mean what we're

317
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,359
seeing right now I mean and this is

318
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,879
something that's um probably everybody

319
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,440
knows about but hop PL and vad is

320
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,278
vectored through seed and so a lot of

321
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,560
the seed uh packs that people are

322
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,720
hunting through um you know they're

323
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,159
bringing in Risk into their into their

324
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,240
business and so we're trying to drisk

325
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,838
that business by working with uh good

326
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,360
fenal hunters and breeders and

327
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,560
supporting their outfits and and their

328
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,639
work with with with clean plants that

329
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,000
are are are stable um you know it's just

330
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,039
too big of a risk we've had a number of

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,399
customers in in Canada that uh you know

332
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:39,519
decided to go down the rabbit hole of

333
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,120
doing a feno hunt and you know N9 months

334
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,560
later they call us back and our entire

335
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,919
facility is infected with HBL and vroid

336
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,559
it's like okay well we kind of told you

337
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,639
that um but uh you know so our job is to

338
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,399
work with amazing breeders and and uh

339
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,120
fenal Hunters bring in the genetics

340
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,198
there so they don't have to because uh

341
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,919
you know the amount of seed out there

342
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,120
that that's full of contamination is is

343
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,479
vast um and you know we're actually

344
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,159
working with a lot of the Breeders now

345
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,440
like JB at se junkie uh tissue culturing

346
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,679
his breeding stock um as well as Atlas

347
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,240
seed and uh so making sure those inbred

348
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,439
breeding lines and those those crosses

349
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,198
are from TC um so that you know we can

350
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,079
ensure that uh you know the breeding

351
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,198
moving into the future is is on the

352
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,039
clean side of things instead of uh kind

353
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,198
of the halfhazard uh mismatch that's

354
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,879
been going on for the last 25 years so

355
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,759
some people out there may not know what

356
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,320
hopan vir is so can you give a little

357
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,159
bit of uh you know what uh you know yeah

358
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,600
absolutely I mean it's a vroid um yeah

359
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,480
yeah it uh it's very catchy uh it can

360
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,440
transfer uh with tools and scissors and

361
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,360
essentially it infects a plant and um uh

362
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,600
Duds it out basically so you know you

363
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,839
can see a drastic decrease in in your

364
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,240
plant's performance overnight um and uh

365
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,720
all of a sudden your 30er is now 10% and

366
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,879
uh the flowers basically unusable um

367
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,278
it's a serious uh it's a serious issue

368
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,078
it's still widespread is everywhere and

369
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:06,078
um you know if you're not testing on a

370
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:08,359
regular basis um you know with quality

371
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,078
uh testing Labs um you know ones that

372
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,959
actually uh will validate their positive

373
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:16,838
or negative hlvd test um you know you're

374
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,198
you're kind of fishing in the dark um

375
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,560
it's it's it's going to be out there for

376
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,799
a long while and the work that um you

377
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:26,719
know we're doing is is to help eradicate

378
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:29,679
that and and educate people um and then

379
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,440
just support uh you know I mean amazing

380
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,120
breeders and fenal Hunters like uh like

381
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,120
Dave here awesome yeah you got to be

382
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,720
careful um anytime you're doing a fenal

383
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,198
hunt anytime you're working with new

384
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,680
plants um you you really want to be

385
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,278
careful to make sure that you are

386
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,719
checking rechecking checking again um

387
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,240
hop late and viroid the only thing I

388
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,120
disagree with with Matt said um was that

389
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,278
it can kind of happen overnight uh

390
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,519
you're actually going to go eight weeks

391
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:54,439
and you're going to get to the end and

392
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,720
then you're going to know that you've

393
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,079
got it and it's going to be uh a sad day

394
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,959
um in your room so yeah it's it's uh

395
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,159
it's something you really got to be

396
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,838
careful for and uh always be careful

397
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,000
when you're taking in uh new genetics

398
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,720
and and making sure that you're getting

399
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,240
them from a clean Source absolutely and

400
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,680
we see a lot of it you know in places

401
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,278
like for example Thailand for example

402
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,078
where you know a lot of genetics are

403
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,759
coming in and a lot of people they are

404
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,799
maybe not so experiencing the kind of

405
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,199
symptoms for example um and you know

406
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,919
more and more facilities that we're able

407
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,639
to visit and it's like you know have you

408
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,198
heard of Hing virid and they're like oh

409
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
no no that's only in North America

410
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:29,240
things like that it's like no it's it's

411
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,719
it's in your grow you know it's seeing

412
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,600
it right now so test it you know and and

413
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,319
I mean it's so perplexing to me why new

414
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,920
countries coming online uh like

415
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:41,838
Australia and New Zealand and um uh even

416
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,639
Germany with the the wck market you know

417
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,880
their their mandate is to import seed

418
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,039
and it's it's it's it's really you know

419
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,078
kind of kneecapping yourself because

420
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,799
you're you're importing a bunch of of

421
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,519
potential problems um you know it's it's

422
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,639
yeah it's it's a heck of a lot of work

423
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,198
because uh fenal hunting as Dave knows

424
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,680
uh is a very long process us um and uh

425
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,919
you may not find any winners um you know

426
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,239
so it's it's a random number generator

427
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,198
essentially to to to to to find a winner

428
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,919
so for sure yeah so we keep saying this

429
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,919
uh feno hunting maybe some people don't

430
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:17,120
know what it actually is maybe Dave you

431
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:20,479
know yeah please sure absolutely um yeah

432
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,399
we pop seeds um and we you know a pheno

433
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,920
hunt is a hunt that we you know conduct

434
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,120
in our rooms um we'll take a room out

435
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,000
and uh we'll prop our rooms will hold

436
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,159
about 300 plants and so that's a that's

437
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,159
a comfortable number number to feno hunt

438
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:38,120
in um we'll run out a genetic that we've

439
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,559
never seen before we pop a lot of seeds

440
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,120
we take clones of all of those and uh

441
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,278
take those through flour um some don't

442
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,159
make it um some are males like depending

443
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,559
if you're if you're hunting regs or if

444
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,799
regular seeds or U feminized seeds

445
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,599
you're going to deal with some males

446
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,559
you're going to deal with some weirdness

447
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,519
um sometimes you'll have interex

448
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,039
properties that'll show up and so those

449
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,000
immediately get turfed uh anything kind

450
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,599
of small and runty is you know you get

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,359
that out of there and then you end up

452
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,480
with your your final population and uh

453
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,198
we'll flower that out uh first time and

454
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,318
get just our you know initial thoughts

455
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,038
okay what do we like what don't like

456
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,639
before we see any uh any lab results if

457
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,519
we like the way it grew the way that the

458
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,679
structure was the yield looked good the

459
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:22,078
flower look good um we'll take it for

460
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,559
another run we'll run a smaller

461
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,918
population of it we'll do like you know

462
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:29,119
maybe 12 or 15 plants run those out take

463
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,160
a look at those hey do we still like it

464
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,918
um is this commercially viable and then

465
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,519
we'll start to ramp up the size and um

466
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,840
of the ones that we call our winners um

467
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:39,359
and then you know lab results are

468
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,319
obviously then into Factor what are the

469
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,319
tpin like is this unique is it a lot

470
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:45,159
like you know Tang's been like such a

471
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,798
prominent tpine that you know you get a

472
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,679
lot of that and so it's just like is

473
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,879
this filling a hole in some do we have

474
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,400
something that we like this and is it

475
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,559
better than what we've already got and

476
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,840
then if those answers are yes then you

477
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,200
know we'll move on to commercialize a

478
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,158
genetic just a question for you Dave how

479
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,480
how many absolute true winners have you

480
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:08,720
had that you've had to toss aside

481
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,519
because of this high THC Matrix papaya

482
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,880
punch rest in

483
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:15,359
peace uh yeah unfortunat uh papaya punch

484
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,120
was it was on the back of my business

485
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,879
card for uh like a year and a half it

486
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,038
was a fantastic plant it was a beautiful

487
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,520
plant makes phenomenal hash rosin uh

488
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:27,119
just really good but just as far as like

489
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,599
does anybody want a 19center that smells

490
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,639
great I

491
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,079
um but yeah it's um yeah we

492
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,880
unfortunately yeah some don't make the

493
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,839
cut it's unruly Beast um when you're

494
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,400
dealing with a lot of plants fortunately

495
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,399
our facilities have now kind of gotten a

496
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,960
little bit bigger we used to be pretty

497
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,519
small and doing feno hunts was a lot

498
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,798
tougher but we're you know as the

499
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,639
company grows it's getting a little bit

500
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:52,158
easier but um yeah that that is a real

501
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,799
factor for sure yeah right on so so yeah

502
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,200
we'll just do one last quick question

503
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,519
before we open it up to to uh for

504
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,240
questions from from the audience let's

505
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,319
say and uh yeah just quickly here you

506
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,599
know you guys both let's say big league

507
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,399
and Serra provide genetics you know all

508
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,918
over the world you do feno hunting but

509
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
what do it actually genetics come from

510
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,840
you know like what kind of Partnerships

511
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,080
you guys are are working with in terms

512
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,399
of breeders and things like that so yeah

513
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,839
absolutely I mean our model is such that

514
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,400
um you know we we know the Breeders are

515
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,599
out there they love doing the work and

516
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,960
we love working with them and helping

517
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,558
them monetize their genetics um so we

518
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,279
get their Platinum breeder selection

519
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,879
cuts and we bring them into in vitro and

520
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,960
we multiply them and and we create

521
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,960
identical twins um and so we can

522
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,319
stabilize those in an in vitro State um

523
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,200
so we work with sea junkie compound

524
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:39,839
Parker Sullivan uh grounded genetics the

525
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,798
holding company a number of different

526
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,480
breeders and we've got some new partners

527
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,599
coming online flavor house uh with drip

528
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,720
genetics they've got some amazing uh new

529
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:54,759
Cuts coming out um and some other future

530
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,759
ones maybe uh coming soon right Dave

531
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:01,480
maybe right on awesome yeah so

532
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,519
we'll open it up to for questions from

533
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,880
the audience um's here for our panel

534
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,879
first of

535
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,480
all Alex Rish had his hand up first and

536
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:14,759
then we'll get over to you and then oh

537
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,640
so we'll go this way we'll do the

538
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,879
triangle and if you're in the back and

539
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,640
you have a question just walk up to one

540
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,240
of the microphones and we'll let you

541
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,360
know I'm not climbing up all these damn

542
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,400
stairs again here we go hey hey guys

543
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,719
awesome panel uh I know most of you but

544
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,880
I wanted to ask this question first of

545
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,720
all I love 19% stuff I like Flavor over

546
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,000
potency any day and it sucks so yes I

547
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,519
got a Pap punch cut for you man um just

548
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,720
a quick question that I I want you guys

549
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,879
to touch on and then I'll pass it off um

550
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,558
the uh tissue culture is so important

551
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,240
and no one's really talking about that

552
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,839
can you talk about why people aren't

553
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,120
talking moral tissue culture and then uh

554
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,599
and can AI or technology be utilized in

555
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,279
making cool genetics in the future

556
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,519
that's

557
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,678
all yeah so I mean tissue culture on a

558
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:59,200
big a scale everybody derives all of

559
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,480
their feed stock for strawberries and

560
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,319
tomatoes and all that kind of stuff from

561
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,798
tissue culture and so it's starting to

562
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,678
evolve in the Cannabis space and it's

563
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,720
becoming more relevant just because of

564
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,519
of the economic risk of of not having it

565
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,159
um so you know you can't keep keep

566
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,119
intercellular bacteria contamination or

567
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,200
ferum out of your mother stock plants um

568
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:21,719
you know we you know refresh them every

569
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,720
3 months um to to to ensure that the the

570
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,038
plants that you're putting into your

571
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,880
system are a control uh when you don't

572
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,960
have plant tissue culture with with the

573
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,720
skill set that our team has uh with the

574
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,519
DNA fingerprinting and the the full

575
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,839
pathogen panel assays and testing that

576
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,240
we do um you know it is an economic risk

577
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,798
that that is a variable and and so you

578
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,960
know in this industry having one crop

579
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,599
failure um you know is challenging if

580
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,919
you have three in a row because you

581
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:47,639
didn't realize that your plants were

582
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,720
infected that could be the Silver Bullet

583
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,759
for your business and so really it's

584
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,240
it's it's it's insulating your economic

585
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,278
bottom line and and you know uh the

586
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,599
economic cost versus the economic risk

587
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:02,519
is not even an equation you want to do

588
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:04,798
the math on um but but yeah yeah lately

589
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,319
we've been recommending a a lot more um

590
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,079
to our clients you know not only to have

591
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,879
their mother stock for example but you

592
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,000
know the backup mothers for example

593
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,960
right and before that and have some kind

594
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,278
of tissue culture Bank let's say either

595
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,880
within their facility or work with a

596
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,759
company or a service that will provide

597
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,640
that you know kind of you know ability

598
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,519
to to keep genetics in in tissue culture

599
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,520
in vitro for yeah I mean a lot of the a

600
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,119
lot of the kind of uh information we're

601
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,519
passing to our customers that that have

602
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,759
had some struggles is is really just

603
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,079
just omitting the mother room alt

604
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,599
together and just getting full provision

605
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,399
plants directly from us uh they can turn

606
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,000
that mother room into a profit Center

607
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,519
instead of an economic um dumpster fire

608
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,200
and uh you know be able to maintain

609
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:43,558
homogeny amongst their you know kind of

610
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,240
bottom

611
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,079
line

612
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,359
fantastic oh no I'll continue on that

613
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,759
cuz he had brought he had asked about

614
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,769
the AI and we're actually doing a little

615
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,000
bit of

616
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:56,798
[Music]

617
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,278
that um yeah we uh we've actually just

618
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,038
implemented a new uh a new system in our

619
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,000
uh in our grow that's that's pretty cool

620
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,640
it's a um it's a camera with a an AI

621
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,278
system kind of backed into it it's also

622
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,679
got uh sensors it's doing Leaf

623
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,359
temperature it's doing uh Bud sights per

624
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,919
square foot and so it's uh analyzing the

625
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,319
room every single day uh all day long

626
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,240
and so we get a report that's written um

627
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:21,158
it's half AI half dealing with plant

628
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,960
scientists but uh it's actually taking a

629
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,080
look at the room every square foot of

630
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,440
the room and so we're actually getting

631
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,839
to see you know is this does it look

632
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,558
like it's yielding more or am I at week

633
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,038
three and I can see that this is already

634
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,319
starting to show signs of something

635
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:36,319
awesome or you know the otherwise so

636
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,558
yeah AI is definitely starting to help

637
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,599
definitely and there's also an

638
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,720
opportunity also for genetics work as

639
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,759
well and looking at you know DNA and and

640
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,519
what are the markers for an actual good

641
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,278
genetic for example right and and how do

642
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,679
we analyze that you know from an anyi

643
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:51,240
perspective that that's also something

644
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,519
very interesting so yeah yeah I mean

645
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,359
we're doing some research I mean we're a

646
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,918
biotech Company by kind of uh origin and

647
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:59,278
um a lot of the work that we're doing

648
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,720
and what we're wanting to do with our

649
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,798
breeders into the future is marker

650
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,200
assisted breeding um so breeding for

651
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,599
traits we're doing some trials right now

652
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,919
with Dr zamir punja which we work with

653
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:12,839
often um on on plants that are

654
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,559
asymptomatic uh asymptomatic to H vroid

655
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,959
uh ferium um some of the other pathogens

656
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,759
and viruses that we test for um and

657
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,759
really looking at those markers just on

658
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,798
a breeding perspective where we can you

659
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,798
know create the the genetics of the

660
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:28,960
future with purpose um and really know

661
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,359
what those traits are um um you know

662
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,079
we're doing that as a side project we

663
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:33,918
don't do that with any of our our

664
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,480
clients genetics without their uh

665
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,000
approvals um but uh you know really into

666
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,200
the future yeah it's not a finalist

667
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,119
program but uh uh you know moving into

668
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,720
the future doing those specific breeding

669
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,319
projects are going to just you know kind

670
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,360
of get us out of this 20year um

671
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,678
halfhazard breeding program that's been

672
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,558
uh going on in the black market for a

673
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,000
little while so yeah all right we have

674
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:58,639
time for maybe two more more right here

675
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,720
yeah you mentioned early on that um you

676
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,399
can identify many different

677
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,240
characteristics from the genetics in

678
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:08,439
terms of the performance of the plant so

679
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,679
for example um how vifer Le it grows uh

680
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,600
how resistant it is maybe for to

681
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:17,480
temperature um how much how how how much

682
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,719
light it can absorb um and still perform

683
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,120
is there any data available on those

684
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,159
other characteristics yet uh in terms of

685
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,439
you know relating those characteristics

686
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,399
to specific genetics yeah we're starting

687
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,960
to do that a bunch um we we have like we

688
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:33,918
we have a nursery which is uh offsite um

689
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,840
it's about a 4,000 ft facility and then

690
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,440
we have our uh grow space which is a

691
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,319
20,000 foot facility so we're constantly

692
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,759
working with our Growers they're all you

693
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,000
know under the big league team and um

694
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,839
you know they're constantly um giving us

695
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,519
data back on on what they do we also

696
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,359
work with uh different partners and

697
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,480
different groups um we're doing some

698
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:55,278
outdoor trials this year uh up in Canada

699
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,278
uh we're doing uh we work with green

700
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,919
houses all the time in Canada but as

701
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,798
more legalization throughout the world

702
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,360
opens up uh we're going to get more and

703
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,679
more of that data going forward to get

704
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,479
to say okay how does it do in a

705
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,480
greenhouse in this area and how does it

706
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
do in a greenhouse in this area uh one

707
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,919
thing that we find with genetics is is

708
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,159
that um just because it's working out in

709
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,919
my facility I've got double-ended high

710
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,559
pressure sodium lights I'm growing in

711
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,080
Cocoa you might grow in rock wool under

712
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,119
LEDs we're going to have different

713
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,158
results and so as we continue to get our

714
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,479
genetics out there and work with Growers

715
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,480
um we get more of that data back yeah I

716
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,839
mean and one of our uh main breeder

717
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,599
Partners JB at C junkie you know when he

718
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,398
does his uh fenal hunting process one of

719
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:41,599
the Matrix that he uses to select as

720
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:43,439
winners uh is the room um Dynamics the

721
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,839
vpds the the light intensities and all

722
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,558
that kind of stuff and so he's really

723
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,158
you know looking for winners that fit

724
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:52,000
that mold so you know kind of the uh

725
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,320
shortcut of the story is that you know I

726
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,839
can grow 17 of his varieties in one room

727
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,398
and they should all perform under the

728
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,519
same room conditions

729
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,839
right here and then right there hey guys

730
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,480
how's it going hey buddy hey Chris hey

731
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:06,480
how are you guys um we talked about this

732
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,200
a little bit the other day but uh I

733
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,839
think that there's a uh especially in

734
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Europe there's a couple genetic

735
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,359
favorites like super silver haze Amnesia

736
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,278
Haze um you know uh that become kind of

737
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,798
household names and a couple repeaters

738
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,359
we see that in you know blue dream and

739
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,359
stuff like that in United States as well

740
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:26,398
do you think there's a shift going on

741
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,759
with fewer more well-known cultivars or

742
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,759
do you think in Europe especially

743
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,558
there's going to the same effect as

744
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,519
United States that we need new like a

745
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,158
lot of new flavors all the time what do

746
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,398
you guys think about product diversity

747
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,559
in that sense I think it's going to

748
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,079
continue I think it's going to be a lot

749
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:43,398
of new new flavors all the time uh I

750
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,558
think that there's definitely going to

751
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:46,959
be you know the the tried and truths

752
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:49,440
your you know your blue dreams and your

753
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,919
Amnesia hazes and um you know there'll

754
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,640
be you know a good Tangi and and and

755
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,960
things like that but I I think that

756
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,559
everybody at least I don't know my

757
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,240
cannabis collection is you know pretty

758
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,918
assorted like I've got you know 20 or 30

759
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,159
different things that were jars that

760
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:05,640
we're checking out at all the time I

761
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,039
don't think anybody really wants like

762
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,240
just a you know one thing it's always

763
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:11,599
nice when you can find a strain that you

764
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,440
can smoke every day um but you know you

765
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,079
still like to go exploring and you know

766
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,519
all the Growers want to be the next

767
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:19,319
cookies so everybody's always trying to

768
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,159
no mine is the best one and this one's

769
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,000
the best

770
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:28,159
one anyway oh here we have time for like

771
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,919
two two two more so three maybe three go

772
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,360
hello hello hello my name is pav I'm

773
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,919
from Czech Republic and we work hard for

774
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:41,479
for legalization and our goal is now 1%

775
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,600
the head say uh in Czech Republic and uh

776
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,200
it will be changed but my question is

777
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,678
simple when I will

778
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:54,679
specialize it on clowns how important is

779
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:58,440
the genetics for starting just cloning

780
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:01,399
uh are just regular seeds or what what I

781
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,519
need to do that I after one year I don't

782
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:07,239
need change the matter matter uh um

783
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,839
plants yeah for sure yeah I mean if

784
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,159
you're if you're off to a fresh start I

785
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,519
mean the reality is you want to start

786
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,919
with something that's that's tried

787
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,440
tested and true um through our Tiss

788
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,320
culture process we create identical

789
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,798
twins so essentially the plants uh

790
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,079
performance um will be the same year 1

791
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,679
and year 10 um you know with her DNA

792
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,319
fingerprinting mapping that morphology

793
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,278
and uh you know you don't want to bring

794
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,359
a a variable into your brand new project

795
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,919
that you've just spent millions of

796
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,879
dollars building um and uh you know with

797
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,519
our support I mean I've got 26 years of

798
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
experience um Mt Rog GE gr got 26 years

799
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,558
of experience So when you buy plants

800
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,239
from us you don't just buy plants uh you

801
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:46,119
get our entire support structure uh you

802
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,839
know to assist in the growth and and

803
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,119
development of your business um and I've

804
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,278
you know I've been doing this for a very

805
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:54,199
long time uh and making the weed world

806
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:56,278
to go around as you know same with Dave

807
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,240
and uh you know we help our customers

808
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:59,558
out there I see many many of of our

809
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,720
customers out in the audience right now

810
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:04,359
and you know without their success we're

811
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,519
not successful so you know we you know

812
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:06,839
when you buy plants from us you're not

813
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,200
just buying plants from us you're buying

814
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,678
our U millions of dollars wor of

815
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,600
mistakes that we've made over the last

816
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:17,000
you know two decades

817
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:20,558
yeah um yeah Jose I have a question for

818
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,640
Jose um in I was recently in the Spanish

819
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:26,960
market and in the clubs there there was

820
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,519
bottom shelf uh Spanish origin middle

821
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,120
shelf better Spanish origin and then top

822
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:35,798
shelf was California and so um my

823
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,879
question is is there really that much

824
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:41,960
difference between the bottom shelf

825
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,840
capabilities in Spain versus the top

826
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:49,120
shelf in California and then for the

827
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:51,639
broader panel is there um a narrowing of

828
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,798
the gap between the skill sets of the

829
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,360
really really good breeders and good

830
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,879
cultivators um is it starting to even

831
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,798
out internationally or is there still

832
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,960
pockets of really good growers in one

833
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:09,839
area and lesser you know skilled Growers

834
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,278
and others thank you yes about the first

835
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:15,798
question I think H the US genetics

836
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:18,240
usually has H by the by the origin no

837
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:20,480
more Tac than the original restraints

838
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,079
that we have in Europe in the last years

839
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,399
but I think it's more the way of work no

840
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:29,079
my colleages here I think are making a

841
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:32,199
very good job and in Europe I think some

842
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:34,839
SE companies must change the way of do

843
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,440
the things no h because there are there

844
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,918
isn't an homogeneous strain there are I

845
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,558
saw a lot of things during this 20 25

846
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,840
years for example sell one one strain

847
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:48,798
and they are selling other restraint at

848
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:51,398
the name you know this in fact must

849
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,839
change in in my opinion so well in the

850
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:54,678
in the class for example they are

851
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:58,918
looking always for the

852
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:01,919
high er uh strains also for new flavors

853
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,159
so I think for that for that reason is

854
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,320
this difference no between the the

855
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,679
Spanish or the European seeds and the

856
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,038
and the use and the use and I think

857
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,759
sometimes it's like almost like a grape

858
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:13,278
vintage you know what I mean like

859
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,440
exactly this was a good year for Blue

860
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,159
Dream this was this this batch just

861
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,240
happened to come out really well and

862
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,519
this batch wasn't great um it happens

863
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,159
all the time in in California in in wi

864
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,278
like 2017 or whatever for sure type of

865
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,880
the Str yeah I mean it's such a a

866
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,720
personal experience as well right I mean

867
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,760
I mean everybody has their own flavor

868
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,278
their own brand for me um our blueberry

869
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,879
is is is was designed for for me um you

870
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:39,599
know and everybody has their own you

871
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,440
know uh drink that they like to drink

872
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,319
and and cigarettes and so I think you

873
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,320
know the time you know we're in our

874
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:47,720
infancy stages of this you know kind of

875
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,519
evolution of of cannabis consumption and

876
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,278
you know you may say you know Spanish

877
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,679
bottom shelf is is is a lower quality

878
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:56,200
but you know that might be my favorite

879
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,240
you know favorite brand and and and that

880
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,798
shelf continues to go up like as as

881
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,359
better access to better genetics like

882
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,960
Canada when it first started like I

883
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,599
think Aurora started with like 250 seeds

884
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,079
and so that's not a lot of selection to

885
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,918
get to pick from and so like as more

886
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,519
genetics become available as more

887
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,480
information becomes available as people

888
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,558
get better at this you got more experts

889
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,919
out there that have done this before

890
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:18,918
like we used to grow in attics and

891
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,919
basements and now we get to grow in

892
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:22,399
stadiums and warehouses it's you know

893
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,799
which are just giant attics and

894
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,278
basements for sure exactly what I also

895
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,440
see too is that you know it the better

896
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,558
the better gentics let's say are coming

897
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,440
from California but not necessarily

898
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:35,119
because let's say that's where the best

899
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,080
Growers are but also there's a

900
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,759
concentration of Growers there breeders

901
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:41,319
you know there's a lot of and also the

902
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:44,240
consumer has a let's say a higher kind

903
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,720
of uh you know a higher bar higher

904
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,359
standard let's say for example but now

905
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,159
you see places like all over the world

906
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,240
like in Canada for example or now we're

907
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,639
seeing in Thailand that yeah California

908
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,720
generics are coming that's what people

909
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:57,240
want based on the name but at the same

910
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,839
time the preference and go going back to

911
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,159
what we're talking before the preference

912
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,558
changes right like we see in Thailand

913
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,080
for example they don't like the gassy

914
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,398
stuff they don't like the fuel you know

915
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,679
they like like more fruity more kind of

916
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,199
like let's say the quintessential sativa

917
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,159
kind of effect things like that so you

918
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,199
know it all changes so I I hate to cut

919
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,960
you off but we're like five minutes over

920
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,559
time this was a really short panel it

921
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,878
was only designed for 30 minutes for

922
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,320
that I apologize I didn't put the

923
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,000
schedule together but uh we we have to

924
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,800
move on but I'm sure you can talk to

925
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,918
everybody outside thank you all very

926
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,919
much let's hear it again from the panel

927
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,759
thanks uh get your pictures in this is

928
