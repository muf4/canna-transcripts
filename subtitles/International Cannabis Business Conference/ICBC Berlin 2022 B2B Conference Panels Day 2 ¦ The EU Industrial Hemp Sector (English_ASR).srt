1
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,940
good afternoon everybody my name is

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,919
Lorenzo and I work for the European

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,599
Industrial Hemp Association and I'm very

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,809
happy and I see that we are super

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,089
excited to discuss about Fighters so

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,160
[Applause]

7
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:22,140
[Music]

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,740
um we will share the presentation with

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,660
me and my colleague Francesco some words

10
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:29,759
so I'm Singapore's advisor I covered

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,340
mostly by economy applications of hemp

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,960
so an agricultural environment it's also

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,579
super boring I'm really boring because

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm covering the upper part of the

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,000
plants where we find the seeds in some

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,840
cannabinoids the leaves and the flower

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,780
so we are a great Association we are

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,500
sitting in Brussels you can see our

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,780
offices in the it's just beside European

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,698
Parliament European commission we are

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,760
doing advocacy and loving at the

22
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:59,218
European level as I said before we are a

23
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,079
small team I'm the managing director and

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,960
with Monica that she's in the room as

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,780
well we take care of the upper part of

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,760
the plants while Francesco and yeah as I

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,079
said we mostly work on agricultural

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
environment and bioeconomy application

29
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,400
with another colleague of mine so it's

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,819
half an hour so we focus on both aspects

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,820
of the plant

32
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:26,759
okay some numbers on our association

33
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:30,299
today we count nearly 240 regular

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,938
members which means companies we have 32

35
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,759
Nation with 32 associate members that

36
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,859
are individual that can join Aya to have

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,659
access to the information we are

38
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,239
building hopefully a little bit more

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,820
some Nation Association

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,158
we are doing that and then we have 12

41
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,519
membership Plus Membership plus tend to

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,700
be a consultant or

43
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,739
a Tax Advisor or lawyers that again they

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,560
can join us and participate in all the

45
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,798
activities that we are doing our biggest

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,460
target I would say is try to Advocate to

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,799
obtain a positive legislation around him

48
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,659
and all its derived products from

49
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,780
Another Side we build as well some

50
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,878
Network for allowed our member to create

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,560
hopefully some business opportunities as

52
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:22,318
well we cover mostly Europe and however

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,539
we are active for me a little bit too

54
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,039
much on National level but we are doing

55
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,219
that because the national level

56
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,098
unfortunately all over 27 member states

57
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,919
we cannot count today on strong National

58
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,259
Association therefore we go beyond our

59
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,018
mandates sometimes and we are active a

60
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,959
national level as well however when it

61
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:47,219
comes to International level the seats

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,620
is empty actually the seed was empty as

63
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,318
we have recently founded the Federation

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,180
of international hemp organization where

65
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,098
all the association coming from

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,280
different continents we have Australia

67
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:02,639
New Zealand China U.S and Canada We join

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,919
forces to be the voice of the sector

69
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,799
within the International Panel meaning

70
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,919
codex sedimentarius FAO and United

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,780
Nations where they do not love so much

72
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,899
yeah but we'll make quite good

73
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,699
progresses actually indeed next

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,459
so what we're talking about we're

75
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:23,280
talking about Cannabis sativa L we

76
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,378
should only speak about one species of

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,280
cannabis which is the Cannabis genius

78
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:31,560
instead of keep speaking about

79
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,598
sativa we believe that there is only one

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,459
Genius of cannabis and then we have

81
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,378
different scientists that evolution of

82
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:42,719
us so indeed and we follow so next

83
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:45,479
and how to define in industrial hemp of

84
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,699
course we usually use the the THC level

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,539
in the on in the on the field

86
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,979
uh which uh can be between it can be

87
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,359
between zero to zero three percent and

88
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,979
one percent because these are the

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,159
average values around the world to

90
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:02,579
distinguish hemp Industrial Hemp from uh

91
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,280
medicinal or adult use uh cannabis

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,099
um now just maybe like a question like

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,759
sort of a question our members cannot

94
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:13,378
reply yes so maybe even you a question

95
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,359
for you so who would you think that

96
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,459
who's defining the THC level that is

97
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,680
allowed in hemp in Europe do you believe

98
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,740
that it's European union or its member

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,180
State assignment can we make this little

100
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:28,400
survey you believe that these European

101
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,400
unions please raise your hands now

102
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,139
okay wonderful so all the others are the

103
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,540
others believe that it's National

104
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,340
actually it's a bit more complex on that

105
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,720
because we always hear about this zero

106
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,758
three percent zero two percent of the

107
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,699
European level but that is only the

108
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,100
threshold for the purpose of giving

109
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,478
direct payments to Farmers so maybe you

110
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,580
know that in Europe pharmacist they

111
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,219
receive money from the European Union

112
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:56,579
to produce whatever property or whatever

113
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,139
but of course industrial have to below

114
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,120
zero two percent and that will be zero

115
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,000
two percent so there is an established

116
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,280
THC level for these payments and many

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,139
members State basically copy pasted that

118
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,619
level and use it for the purpose of the

119
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,079
legality of the crop but infinite it is

120
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,720
the member state that decides what is

121
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,879
the maximum level of THC in the hand

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,860
plant and there are countries for

123
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,860
example a Czech Republic that adopted

124
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,199
one percent recently enters Italy uh it

125
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,939
went up to 0.6 percent so it's a sort of

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,300
a margin when it comes to controls on

127
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:34,379
the field but overall uh the 0.3 percent

128
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:38,060
will be the least it will be at least

129
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,800
0.3 percent from the first January 2023

130
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,959
Jesus was an advocacy

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,939
um battle it was it was a battle

132
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,680
actually because we have we had many

133
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,418
many people against increasing the

134
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,340
increase of the GHC level on the field

135
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:54,060
from zero two to zero three so it will

136
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,859
be industry from next year so again in

137
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,160
the end it is member state that decide

138
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,800
what is uh yes let's rate it because

139
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,960
it's so important and so many many

140
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,620
people have no idea so the zero three

141
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,478
percent is linked to direct payment what

142
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,459
does it mean it needs it if I am a

143
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,918
farmer wherever I am in Europe and I

144
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,500
decided to plant up to zero four if

145
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,639
there are no other

146
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,800
regulation on National level that

147
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,220
doesn't allowed me it simply means that

148
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,460
Brussels is not sending me the money

149
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,259
as a farmer not that I'm not allowed and

150
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,000
this is very important so the question

151
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,879
that we have asked to everybody is the

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,339
zero cream illegal or whatever it is a

153
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,199
legal limits yes or no the answer is no

154
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,719
it's just linked to direct payment but

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,819
then as Francisco explained each member

156
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,759
State can do a little bit whatever they

157
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,979
want and most of the time they misuse

158
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,319
these limits that again it's only for

159
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,120
direct payment the case will be 30 up to

160
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,500
zero six they adapt the case of Czech

161
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,079
Republic performance

162
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,759
and also this is more like our

163
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,560
definition of hemp what is industrial

164
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,720
hemp or what should be Industrial Hemp

165
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,259
so it should be cannabisity varieties

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,940
that are growing open field in a using

167
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,038
sustainable farming practices ideally

168
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,399
this is where in Europe we're moving

169
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:13,318
towards more sustainable farming and

170
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,239
where the whole plant is used you can

171
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,520
see here there's a seed in production

172
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,759
and a

173
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:23,339
hemp for for fiber whole plant approach

174
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,900
it is key for us because it makes sense

175
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,818
from a sustainability point of view from

176
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,439
economic point of view of course we have

177
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,360
to work a bit on the varieties on the

178
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,899
farming practices to make sure that we

179
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,680
can Harvest both seeds and fiber flowers

180
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:41,698
and fibers it will do a title you will

181
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,439
try to use as well so uh this if grown

182
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,199
this way is a highly sustainable crop

183
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,120
you all know the advantages of hemp for

184
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,800
the soil for the air for the bees and

185
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,560
for the bioeconomies a little bit

186
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,460
clearer please if you plant

187
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,220
hand into a greenhouse in pots this is

188
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:02,279
not so sustainable we believe that

189
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,680
industrial hand cultivated in this way

190
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,559
meaning double of triple use it really

191
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,000
becomes a sustainable plant so it is a

192
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,740
different sector I mean of course you

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,319
can I mean I'm sure we encourage those

194
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,000
who plant indoor to make sure that they

195
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,560
have a higher sustainability when it

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,720
comes to for example energy consumption

197
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,819
which seems to be the only things you

198
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,039
can play with so how much energy used in

199
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,800
your Greenhouse but of course we cannot

200
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:29,159
make the same claim for indoor grown

201
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,459
hemp cannabis whatever as we can for

202
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,759
outdoor ground cannabis

203
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,759
that point

204
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,038
so what are we observing now what are we

205
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,379
stand when it comes to hand products

206
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,439
Market here in Europe uh are we

207
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:49,200
experiencing a Renaissance of hand uh

208
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,200
well we believe that we are moving from

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,259
Zero to Hero uh we're maybe not there

210
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,259
yet but we'll we'll get there and please

211
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,259
do not underestimate the potential of

212
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:05,939
fiber and ships application because

213
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:07,559
and um is is looked at by big industrial

214
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,660
companies working in construction sector

215
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,379
in the textile sector not modern sector

216
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:15,299
and it is the best resource for

217
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,338
transition towards cleaner economies

218
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,139
because it's the only fiber crop that we

219
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,000
can grow everywhere in Europe from

220
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,819
Finland to Sicily

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,339
and it is also very high quality crop so

222
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,320
uh it is it is a great opportunity not

223
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,360
only for the medical purposes that have

224
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,800
been discussed until now at the

225
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,000
conference but also for bioeconomy

226
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,519
applications and of course a food

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,759
application does not forget seats and of

228
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,560
course the flowers for CBD products as

229
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,958
we said it's a highly sustainable crop

230
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:48,479
and it can also bring opportunities for

231
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,338
repatriating Value chains maybe for

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,860
those who come from from the Americas

233
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,019
are not uh acquainted with the

234
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,300
vocabulary that has been used by the

235
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,919
European institutions but they've

236
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,219
they've been speaking more and more

237
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,919
about getting back to Value chains all

238
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,540
the I mean the trade war between China

239
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,000
and U.S and then the Ukraine war and

240
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:12,000
then the covet we saw how fragile our

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,339
value chains are Global level and we are

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,500
we like European institutions and

243
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,600
National institutions institutions are

244
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,100
trying to rebuild those valuations here

245
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,320
in Europe and this is a great

246
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,200
opportunity for those who want to invest

247
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,180
in industry

248
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,759
let's

249
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,578
talk about feeding the food and feed as

250
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,879
well absolutely food and feed belongs to

251
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:37,819
the seeds so we can harvest the seeds on

252
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,559
top of the fibers as we have said before

253
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,839
why we are interested in in the seeds

254
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,359
because it's a it's a good protein it

255
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,000
contains a good protein contents it's

256
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,620
it's a plant-based alternative we know

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,078
that there are many people that are

258
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,320
switching their diets towards a more

259
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,539
plant-based diet so hemp could be on top

260
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,720
of all the others a good source of

261
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:03,838
alternative for meat it's a it's a trend

262
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,639
that is increasing dramatically we have

263
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,700
seen some figures during our conference

264
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,860
and it's a it's a booming sector that is

265
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,940
still for me untapped when it comes to

266
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:17,278
to hemp but the margin to grow are quite

267
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,100
are quite good it can be sold as well as

268
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,838
a food supplement and of course we are

269
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,940
not throwing away any parts of the

270
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,260
plants which makes one more time and

271
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:31,920
really a sustainable crop next please

272
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:36,059
when we talk about seeds The Operators

273
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:39,019
have a small issue which as well issue

274
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:42,778
that we saw the useful

275
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:45,299
we also absolutely and so when The

276
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:47,039
Operators are trading hemp seeds there

277
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:50,578
is only one thing that they have to

278
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,699
control is the THC limits in the seeds

279
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,859
meaning in the final product so still a

280
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,940
couple of not till the 1st of January

281
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:03,300
2023 in Europe there are no maximum

282
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,000
level of THC in the seeds which make the

283
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,799
operators became crazy because there is

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,620
different value or there is no value

285
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,078
because till today we only had the next

286
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,539
opinion by definition an opinion is not

287
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,479
a legally binding however my mistakes

288
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:20,519
were looking so closely to this opinion

289
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,079
coming from Elsa which is the sorry

290
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,078
European Food Safety Authority

291
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:29,480
so as I said to see now there was no

292
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:32,458
maximum level

293
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,379
Association advocate for many years and

294
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,599
finally convince the member state to

295
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,899
adopt the maximum level that is similar

296
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,700
from Poland to Lisbon and especially its

297
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,458
mandatory meaning that all member states

298
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,399
have to comply so you see in the slide

299
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,078
these are the limits let's explain a

300
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,600
little bit a little bit so the bad

301
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:54,778
mistake gave us three MGS per kilogram

302
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,139
for seeds and 7.5 for the oil

303
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:01,439
on top of that they allowed us like any

304
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,778
other protein or any other food they

305
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,200
allowed us to add an uncertainty factor

306
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:10,139
to make sure that the range is respected

307
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,180
so when do we count the maximum level we

308
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,579
should make a simple calculation the

309
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:17,519
maximum level plus the uncertainty

310
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:19,559
factor which brings us to the value that

311
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,459
you can see on the right side of the

312
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:26,939
screen so this value let's take the 10

313
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:29,458
the 11 PPM PPM is equal that milligram

314
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,000
per kilogram this is the same value of

315
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:36,000
Canada and us so we are quite happy we

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,159
are still have some limits that are

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,339
lower compared to Canada anyways when it

318
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,980
comes to seeds but so far we cannot

319
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,139
increase them more why because we do not

320
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,220
have any studies that show that we can

321
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:52,860
go beyond the irdf which stands for

322
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,320
acute reference dose for THC so this is

323
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,320
why we are conducting but we see that

324
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,800
later the biggest trial on human beings

325
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,420
on THC next please

326
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,278
these are some examples of products that

327
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:07,860
we can find today on the market that

328
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,559
derive from seeds as you see we do have

329
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,839
products we do have this product you can

330
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,179
find them in most of the supermarket in

331
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,220
in Europe and is a growing sector

332
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,939
definitely

333
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,940
it's the same

334
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,459
answer we have to talk about the fiber

335
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,860
are you alive so when it comes to the

336
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,899
flower and the leaves we would love to

337
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,240
sell them as food supplement members

338
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,759
they do not agree European Food Safety

339
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,539
Authority is needed so we have an issue

340
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:43,198
as you can see and what we do not like

341
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,539
and this make our members very angry and

342
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,578
I have to admit that I agree with them

343
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,539
is that member states are changing their

344
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,239
mind

345
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,639
in 1997 the European Industrial Hemp

346
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,198
Association had received not one two

347
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,539
letters from the European commission

348
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,939
saying guys go ahead it's not enough

349
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:02,639
food it's original food therefore our

350
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,399
members instead the money into her into

351
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,519
processing line to Market this product

352
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,740
as food supplement then comes 2016 there

353
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,539
is a booming on the market the members

354
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,820
they are getting nervous so they've

355
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:17,159
decided to change the so-called novel

356
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,199
food catalog which again is not

357
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,000
politically binding document by member

358
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,458
State because there is nothing on him

359
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,500
they tend to follow even a non-legally

360
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,500
binding dog what is another answer

361
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,799
food is a food that has not to be

362
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,740
consumed after a significant degrees

363
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,359
before 1997. we can discuss hours what

364
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,159
does it mean significant we will not

365
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,620
agree so imagine if I do agree with

366
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,259
member State on that so 2016 we

367
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,720
experienced the first change some of the

368
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,300
products are novel some of them are

369
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,720
still not novel Foods so the market is

370
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:54,419
still surviving quite well 2019 I joined

371
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,399
area 10 days after we got the change on

372
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:58,620
the catalog everything is now released

373
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,078
flour and extract again what does it

374
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,578
mean novel it means that you need a

375
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,099
pre-market authorization before

376
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:06,838
marketing this product again what does

377
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,060
it mean it's a very complex and very

378
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,180
costly process that allows you to obtain

379
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:14,099
a paper that makes authorities feel more

380
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,239
comfortable when they see your products

381
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,759
on the market

382
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,480
and then it happened 2020

383
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,600
we I would say that we never expect such

384
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,060
a change but in 2020 for a moment that

385
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,159
was hopefully very brief was brief

386
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:30,838
couple of months the European commission

387
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,360
and the member State thought that hemp

388
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,220
was an narcotic then they said that they

389
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
were joking so at the end of the 2020

390
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,180
they changed their mind and they

391
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:43,740
confirmed that all parts of the plants

392
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:45,899
can be considered a food novel but still

393
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,399
a food let's see what's going on

394
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:51,059
afterwards

395
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,440
this is our position the the position of

396
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,539
Our member the position of the

397
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,759
association guess what we do not agree

398
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,819
with member states so we do believe that

399
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:03,480
only isolate and enrich cannabinoids

400
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,818
should be considered as novel food while

401
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,919
low concentration or what we call the

402
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,720
naturally curing level of cannabinoids

403
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,660
should be should be traded like it was

404
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,500
before 2016 and before as a traditional

405
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,079
food

406
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,380
next

407
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,198
so what we are doing we have decided I

408
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,480
don't know why but we did it to do the

409
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,120
novel food application on the behalf of

410
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,038
our members so we have founded a

411
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,918
Consortium of companies we have

412
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,960
collected 3.5 million of euros and we

413
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,080
have launched southern food application

414
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,740
we have one for isolated CBD we have one

415
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:43,319
for synthetic CBD nobody no one of our

416
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,538
members care about synthetic CBD but you

417
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,058
remember hemp was an narcotics so only

418
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,980
synthetic was a viable solution for us

419
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,440
so we have filled in even the

420
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,960
application for synthetic but where we

421
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,779
care the most are the full spectrum

422
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,840
extract which are the more complex why

423
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,879
because they do contains THC so for

424
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,678
these three type of products we have

425
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,600
conducted and we are still conducting

426
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,100
another food application on the behalf

427
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:12,418
of our member next where we stand

428
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:14,000
these are the talks that we have been

429
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:17,160
doing two big

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,579
expenses nearly 2 million of Euros were

431
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,380
spent on the toxicity of isolating full

432
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,779
spectrum these are all the studies that

433
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,700
we have been performing so far and then

434
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:30,599
in parallel as I said before because

435
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:33,298
food Spectrum contains THC we decided to

436
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,879
invest 1.6 million of euros into the

437
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:38,819
biggest trial for THC on human beings

438
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,080
that will start in couple of weeks in

439
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,779
Portugal

440
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:46,139
so we'll see we'll get results next year

441
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:48,720
next year for both the THC the sorry the

442
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,640
isolate CBD is over so always submit the

443
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,440
application to us a very shortly the

444
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,538
full spectrum is still ongoing will be

445
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,298
done by the end of the year the trial on

446
00:18:54,538 --> 00:19:00,058
human beings will be 2023

447
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:01,918
so we'll discuss about flower sheets and

448
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,319
let's get back to the fibers and the

449
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,419
ships for just a quick reminder it's

450
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,879
it's a bit different than harvesting

451
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,280
flowers and seeds there are specific

452
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,520
farming practices harvesting machines

453
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,980
and the very important part of hemp

454
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,220
processing for fiber is erecting which

455
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,900
can be performed in many different ways

456
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,759
according to the geographical area with

457
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,280
the program so you can do directing or

458
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,839
green writing writing on the field where

459
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,220
you have enough rain enough water or

460
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,839
humidity but you cannot do that for

461
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,500
example in Italy and then you need other

462
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,939
Technologies like ultrasound microbial

463
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,579
enzyme writing so in a controlled

464
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,940
environment possibly in water and then

465
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:45,839
of course you go you get the Bales and

466
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,820
you go to the blood pressure processing

467
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,439
site and there are two different way of

468
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,178
processing and fiber depending on what

469
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,000
you want to get if you want to get the

470
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,440
long fiber you can apply the same

471
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,819
Technologies actually it's a bit more

472
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,919
complex than this but I would make it

473
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,158
simple so if you want to get the long

474
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,380
fiber for textile applications

475
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,960
basically like flux you can use the same

476
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,179
sketching lines as for flux and we're

477
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,819
pretty good at that in Europe because we

478
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,798
produce 85 percent of the flex volumes

479
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,500
in the world and we have all discussion

480
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,599
facilities basically otherwise if you

481
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,519
want to work on technical fibers or

482
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,859
short fiber for cottonization for making

483
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,859
cotton-like

484
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,859
um Yarns or for insulation material

485
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:31,678
paper crate the fiber you go through a

486
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,538
decortication facility so those

487
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,460
countries who do don't do not have the

488
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:38,460
communication facility might have a hard

489
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,740
time or scratching blind hard time

490
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,380
investing in the in in the fiber market

491
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,839
so numbers how many qualifications we do

492
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,380
have in Europe we have around between 10

493
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,298
and 15 the corticators some of them they

494
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,799
are assembled but not active but we have

495
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:53,940
for example we have two in Germany I

496
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,240
believe

497
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,919
see see we have two in the Netherlands

498
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,380
five or six in France

499
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,659
and there are more elsewhere uh uh

500
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,559
whereas I understand that there are some

501
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:09,780
uh some Canadian and U.S nicoticas are

502
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,700
coming up but I'm not sure I don't know

503
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,619
where they stand

504
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,659
um the core product which is byproduct

505
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,359
whether of the fiber production is our

506
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:20,159
ships huge market for ships you kind of

507
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,379
give an image imagine imagine it's mulch

508
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,940
it's animal padding animal batting

509
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,220
Market explode in the past years because

510
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,720
everybody was getting like profits and

511
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,779
stuff at home

512
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,339
um but it's also very important yes many

513
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,200
companies are out of stock but also it's

514
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,199
it's a material used in construction

515
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,140
industry and you cannot imagine how many

516
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,840
construction companies some of them that

517
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,360
are also in the stock markets in Europe

518
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:48,538
are getting interested in hemp in

519
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,839
construction and are already producing

520
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:54,658
um amp-based construction material lines

521
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,399
well I don't have to repeat myself uh

522
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,799
especially by economy products are those

523
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,280
where the the carbon storage potential

524
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,079
of hemp is at the its best

525
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,538
um we have huge markets in perspective

526
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,579
and just to give you I I will not repeat

527
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:11,220
myself about reputation of value chains

528
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:15,298
but just to give you a few numbers of of

529
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,798
the huge Market side uh so the non-woven

530
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,918
uh

531
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,440
huge Market again it's a medical

532
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,179
applications absorbent papers hygiene

533
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,058
products it's 99 billion euros turnover

534
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,120
in 2019 only in Europe if we're talking

535
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:35,579
about natural fiber overall for any type

536
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:39,000
of application globally we have 60

537
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:43,019
billion of markets

538
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,579
synthetic fiber 147 billion and

539
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:48,900
Construction Products that is sorry

540
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:51,298
Euros not US Dollars 800 billion worth

541
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,559
Market only in Europe for Construction

542
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:57,359
Products so even if we had like 0.5 of

543
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,339
those Market I would I would believe

544
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,379
that would that will represent

545
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:04,139
great opportunities for

546
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,280
for companies so

547
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,580
um

548
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,139
just some some products uh in in the

549
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,960
different applications so this is

550
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,480
textile you've seen for sure Patagonia

551
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,980
costs so H9 group Nike

552
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,500
Etc

553
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,659
um construction product construction

554
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,880
materials I mean they're quite good we

555
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:26,039
have France UK that fight much Advance

556
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,260
there are nice companies also big ones

557
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,538
uh using hemp for installation or for

558
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:35,940
making hardwood

559
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:37,558
bricks NC to cast MK prefab walls uh

560
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,038
Romanian as well but we will have also

561
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:43,379
Italy there's any Italian company also

562
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:45,960
of a conventional company

563
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,380
so uh very good because they perform

564
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,360
very well in terms of quality they store

565
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,659
Carbon on very long term they have good

566
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,298
terminal cost acoustic performances

567
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,880
and on top of that we have Composites

568
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:02,579
and Plastics let's all forget that you

569
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,900
can also extract cellulose from him

570
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:10,199
you can use the fiber to reinforce

571
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:13,140
biomaterials more than in any shape you

572
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,880
you also have granulates and filaments

573
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,059
for 3D printing so basically you can do

574
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,640
whatever and either from the cellulose

575
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:24,058
or for the fiber you can mix the fiber

576
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,640
with the resins as I said and then so

577
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:28,678
yeah maybe the question would be

578
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,900
where to invest or rather how will be

579
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,400
the economy of the future

580
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,860
um I mean

581
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,659
all countries on geographical areas have

582
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:37,918
their own peculiarities I believe that

583
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,740
it's interesting to see what's going on

584
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,940
in the U.S and Canada but it's not the

585
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,620
EU we have a complete different path

586
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,240
different societies different

587
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,558
philosophies different political

588
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,960
institutions

589
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:54,658
and different objectives and in some

590
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,120
ways we're also opposite for example to

591
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,520
the American culture on some things

592
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,319
um I personally believe maybe we believe

593
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,778
in any cases Ayah that we have great

594
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,240
opportunities ahead for him especially

595
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:10,079
in the by economy for food for the food

596
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,179
market and so let's let's not forget

597
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,899
about industrial hemp and all its

598
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:18,600
applications so some take-home messages

599
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,100
as we said invest on sustainability on

600
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,319
outdoor hemp

601
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,058
investment processing facilities for the

602
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,720
fiber extraction because again huge

603
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:29,639
markets ahead uh use old core products

604
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,960
because there are markets for all of

605
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,480
them

606
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,120
but always aim at one application when

607
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,179
you grow and you grow and for one

608
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,459
purpose but then you valorize local

609
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:44,100
products and with the time today we have

610
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,500
around 82 varieties in Europe we've seen

611
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:49,678
many new ones in the past four or five

612
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,980
months there are few uh not eight as it

613
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,559
was arrived in a paper but okay there

614
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,740
will be more coming up so uh variety of

615
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:02,759
research will will develop further and

616
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,220
we will achieve like full whole plant

617
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,480
approach uh hopefully everywhere in

618
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,640
Europe but of course you have to take

619
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,380
into account that you have to aim at

620
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,740
something in particular and when it

621
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,440
comes to CBD Lawrence a few final words

622
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,558
um yes CBD as food supplement as I said

623
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,778
before it will be tough but this is the

624
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,599
product that we believe is much more

625
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:27,538
suitable for our Market the talk studies

626
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,759
are coming and science seems to be with

627
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:31,619
us so today is not the value to share

628
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,538
preliminary results this is something to

629
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:37,199
be discussed with our members

630
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:40,019
but it will it will support science will

631
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,179
be with us and hopefully the all the

632
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,579
application will be submitted to Absa

633
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:46,019
and then we will wait for their risk

634
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:48,658
assessment

635
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:51,538
there is one take-home message which is

636
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,460
join Aya join the association uh

637
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,379
participate in the working group neither

638
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,200
many neither Francesco we have no clue

639
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,539
about the technicity or all the the

640
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,480
peculiarity so we need your expertise

641
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,579
and then in this way the better informed

642
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,259
we are the much more efficient we will

643
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:10,199
be in front of the authorities without

644
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:12,599
you without your support we don't go so

645
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,840
far indeed thank you they pretend to

646
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:19,579
have a Saturday so now we're four right

647
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,579
so thank you

648
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:27,298
[Applause]

649
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,919
does anyone have a question

650
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:30,898
there's one right there hey bro

651
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,299
microphones coming to you one more time

652

Jessica

654
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,000
[Music]

655
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,899
hey thanks a lot for your presentation

656
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,380
today

657
00:27:39,898 --> 00:27:46,139
um I actually have two questions

658
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:48,539
what was the argument against super 0.2

659
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,360
percent versus point three

660
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:54,778
um but that wasn't my main question

661
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,599
it with emphasis superfood

662
00:27:54,778 --> 00:28:00,659
um is there an opportunity for grain

663
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:03,719
Farmers to ship to Africa to backfill

664
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,700
the loss of Supply from the Ukraine for

665
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,798
wheat and other grains I was just

666
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,960
wondering if there's an opportunity that

667
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:13,139
I taught a class in the University of

668
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,659
Nebraska on the economics of him and we

669
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,600
talked about this but the U.S isn't

670
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:22,200
ready I was just wondering if if the U.S

671
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:23,699
I take the second one oh can I if you

672
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,640
guys I will leave you to you to explain

673
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,259
the French situation so when it comes to

674
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,200
protein you're right there is an

675
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:33,240
imbalance in moment because we we cannot

676
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,700
count anymore on Ukraine at least for

677
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,620
this year so we need to rebalance again

678
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,759
there is a lack of protein around the

679
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:44,579
world and certainly hemp with other

680
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:48,359
Alternatives could Supply this Gap

681
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:51,359
Europe is not ready we have 50

682
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,699
000 actors where do you want me to go I

683
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,158
cannot even feel half of Malawi I mean

684
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:59,100
it's impossible so Europe is not ready

685
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,159
yet why we are not doubling the actors

686
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:04,259
because the regulation is locked so

687
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,778
there is no real wish from that farmer

688
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,298
today and then the farmers now the

689
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:11,460
prices are different after the Ukrainian

690
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:15,658
so they are thinking why should I invest

691
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,360
in plant hemp then the police can came

692
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,240
here and probably throw away half of my

693
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:24,418
of what I've been growing so and

694
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,599
everything is a little bit blocked today

695
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:30,000
so probably there is a much there is an

696
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,918
opportunity for U.S or Canada but

697
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,319
certainly we don't have enough to export

698
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,759
we need a little bit more also if I may

699
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,859
let's not make the mistakes that we made

700
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,640
in the past with with countries around

701
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:43,079
the world basically shipping everything

702
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,520
and killing their value chain so the

703
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:46,139
objective is to empower those countries

704
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,519
to make sure they have the value chain

705
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,520
so they can produce their own food

706
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,558
because I mean that would be a very good

707
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,558
purpose yeah but in the short term yeah

708
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:59,159
on producing them before feeding I think

709
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:02,778
it takes a little bit longer and then on

710
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,778
the Zero t zero two zero two percent

711
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,659
they're nasty no there are so uh the

712
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,879
point was that there were some players

713
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,320
that detained you know there were some

714
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,500
players that they had the commercial

715
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:18,960
interest in uh keeping the 0.2 because

716
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,940
they could sell varieties at 0.2 and

717
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,740
opening going up to zero three or

718
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,558
potentially one percent means more space

719
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,480
for new varieties to be registered so

720
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:31,990
yeah he was terribly politically correct

721
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,108
thank you thank you all so very much

722
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,108
