1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,439
all right all right all right how's

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,160
everyone feeling out there y'all feeling

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,399
good

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,800
today no hey y'all glad to be in Germany

5
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:10,800
while we had just legalized

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,198
it y'all feeling good in Germany cuz we

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,759
just legalized it

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,880
make I see BC yo I'm going tell you

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,599
something y'all I came here in 216 and I

10
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:26,759
had a dream and a vision to bring B2B

11
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,278
cannabis to Europe because we know that

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,759
the market fuels the politics the policy

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,640
fuels the market market so here we are 7

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,039
years later under legalization but when

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,920
I came in 26 everyone thought I was

16
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,200
crazy okay and I remember I remember gor

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,760
V saying to me Alex I'm very worried for

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,199
you $500 a ticket we are very how you

19
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,519
say gtic people I do not know I was like

20
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:52,960
well GE gorg I'm worried too but what

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,840
happened we built a whole movement

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,558
around B2B cannabis in Germany and here

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,359
we are today in 217 we had the first

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:06,719
ICBC and I guess I got lucky SCH

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,478
hopped and what happened was medical

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,959
marijuana uh uh basically was was

27
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:15,640
legalized just before the first ICBC in

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,959
217 and that was great and I knew that

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,719
eventually cannabis would be legal in

30
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,039
Germany I had a feeling it would be the

31
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,478
first real Market that cannabis would

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,360
become legal in now I know there's

33
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,039
ambiguity or semantics whether it's

34
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,159
legal or not now but it has opened up

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,840
and we know it's been decriminalized now

36
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,600
we know cannabis has taken off the

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,118
narcotics list in Germany which is one

38
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,679
of the greatest public policy

39
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,078
achievements regarding cannabis in world

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,759
history so we only we have the Social

41
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,559
Clubs phase one phase two but we also

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,599
have that uh uh medical marijuana is

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,478
going to get a huge boost now in Germany

44
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,039
and uh one of my favorite things that's

45
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,519
happening a lot of people don't know is

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,960
that criminal penalties have been

47
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,319
reduced for cannabis also so this is the

48
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,919
this is where you have a a truly

49
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,319
Progressive Society where we understand

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,318
that prohibition doesn't work stop

51
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,318
locking people up for using an

52
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,839
herb it's about time and there was then

53
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,079
one thing I said when I got on stage in

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,519
217 at the mar Time pro some of you out

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
there I know were actually there who was

56
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:28,519
at the first ICBC in

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,680
217 awesome awesome awesome so was I um

58
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,159
and uh uh I said there's two most

59
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,640
important things when it comes to

60
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,598
changing cannabis policy and this really

61
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,359
comes from an activist perspective not

62
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:43,119
from a business perspective per se and I

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,800
said well this is what I said I said the

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,959
policy makers are going to things

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,920
up that's just true that's just what

66
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,680
they do that's the nature of the

67
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,439
bureaucracy that's the nature of

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
politics I said but what's most

69
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,400
important is that we end criminal

70
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:02,158
penalties towards cannabis and everyone

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,200
can grow plants at their house because I

72
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:08,798
believe growing cannabis at your house

73
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,798
is a fundamental human

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:17,120
right jack ha was my mentor in 1993 I

75
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,120
met Jack Jack ha and he um the gruff old

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,560
bastard was pretty much right about

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
everything and he said hemp could save

78
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,360
the planet well I wasn't sure if hemp

79
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,159
could really save the planet then I knew

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
I like to smoke hemp back then and I

81
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:31,519
knew I like to hang out with Jack ha and

82
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,438
kind of the the band of Rascals that he

83
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,280
was touring around um but 30 years ago I

84
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,438
was on hate ashbery with my dreadlocks

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,640
telling everybody to legalize cannabis

86
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,199
cuz it would save the world and

87
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,199
everybody was laughing at us but

88
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,958
