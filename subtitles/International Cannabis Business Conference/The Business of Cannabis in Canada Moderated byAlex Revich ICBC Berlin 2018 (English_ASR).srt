done before I introduce this awesome

33
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:28,379
group of panelists I want to give

34
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,118
everyone a brief history of Canada to

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,699
put a little context into how we've come

36
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,500
to where we are it's all started back in

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,118
around 1999 when the first people

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,459
started using cannabis for medical

39
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,280
purposes a lot of them were HIV patients

40
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,868
from Toronto of where I'm from and I

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,009
kind of describe it if anyone seen the

42
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,629
movie Dallas buyers club

43
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,728
I don't know anyone's seen it if not

44
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,978
probably check it out it's it's really

45
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,629
the story is people wanted to use it it

46
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,828
was helping them and the guy and the

47
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,118
people said yeah and the government said

48
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,709
you know let's do some more research on

49
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,060
this and we'll tell you if this is good

50
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,748
and they said we don't have time we're

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,579
dying we need this right now so they

52
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:04,078
fought it up to the Supreme Court and

53
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,548
the Supreme Court gave them the right to

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,498
use cannabis but they said where am I

55
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,810
supposed to buy this cannabis from so

56
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:10,829
they said okay we'll let you grow it but

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,420
a lot of people can't grow their own

58
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,980
cannabis I don't know if you heard it's

59
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,318
not as easy as a lot of people

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,268
so they allowed someone else to grow it

61
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,280
for them as a designated grower which

62
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,140
had some issues with it with some

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,390
designated growers growing a couple

64
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,479
extra plants buy a couple extra plants I

65
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,889
mean a few thousand plants extra and

66
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,530
we're making a little money on the side

67
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,229
so that program died that was called

68
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,769
MMAR and in 2014 they introduced MMPR

69
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:39,298
medical marijuana for purposes

70
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,640
regulatory purposes which is quite a

71
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,560
mouthful and that allowed for licensed

72
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,359
producers to sell the cannabis but there

73
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,739
wasn't enough cannabis at the time so

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,209
they allowed both programs to run

75
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,920
simultaneously until 2016 when a cmp are

76
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:57,479
access to cannabis for medical purposes

77
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,429
regulations ACM PR allows for licensed

78
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,108
producers and people to grow for their

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,719
own and for cannabis oils which were

80
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,359
introduced in 2016 so just to give you a

81
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,859
quick little snapshot of our industry

82
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,909
when I started about five years ago

83
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,730
those less than a hundred doctors

84
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:13,530
prescribing we now have over 11,000

85
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,658
doctors prescribing so your challenges

86
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,209
about doctors not prescribing we know we

87
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,709
feel it we have some thoughts on why

88
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,289
that is and how you can overcome it

89
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,319
which we'll talk about also we currently

90
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:28,048
have around 400,000 patients and over 30

91
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:31,229
licensed sellers of cannabis and over

92
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,689
almost a hundred licensees but a lot of

93
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:35,219
those licensees are owned by some

94
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,568
cannabis companies so don't be fooled

95
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,759
it's not that there's a hundred separate

96
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:40,649
companies some companies have multiple

97
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,628
licenses and just some market data

98
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,099
there's around two thousand kilograms a

99
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:46,078
month sold this is from December from

100
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,638
help from Health Canada one thing we're

101
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,799
very lucky that Health Canada provides

102
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,120
us stats and data where I know in

103
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,099
Germany there's a lot of challenges to

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,900
find out what the information is on how

105
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,369
much is going on in Canada they're

106
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,810
giving it to us it's a little outdated

107
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,669
but it's better than nothing so from

108
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,430
December around 2,000 kilograms and

109
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,709
months old and 3,000 kilograms of oil

110
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,650
around a hundred and fourteen thousand

111
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,759
shipments are done a month in December

112
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,069
and we're busy gearing up for

113
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,628
legalization and exporting it and all

114
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:14,789
that kind of stuff because as of

115
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:17,219
December there was 38,000 kilograms in

116
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,659
inventory so definitely lots in

117
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,229
inventory and eleven thousand kilograms

118
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,329
of oil

119
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:22,949
the average script size is about two

120
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,090
point four grams someone was asking me

121
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,079
the other day what the average scrip

122
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,959
size so I just wanted to let everyone

123
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,389
know it's about 2.4 grams

124
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,159
now really excited to introduce these

125
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:34,038

00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:25,269
more akin to pharmaceutical products

00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:24,468
brand value with the products that we

168
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,448
sell and do that all backed in science

169
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,918
so we have a number of scientists 15

170
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:30,978
scientists on staff and we do everything

171
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,508
with validated proper methodologies we

172
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:34,879
are pursuing a public listing in the

173
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,408
next couple of months and we look

174
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,209
forward to entering the German market in

175
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:40,909
the in the years ahead

176
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,560

188
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,848
with wean income companies started at

189
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:12,020
less than a year ago partnered with

190
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:15,439
arguably some of the other industry

191
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,629
experts in Canada top regulatory firm

192
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,550
and lawyers and really looked at how he

193
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:22,370
could innovate the the production

194
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,189
platform really been building out and

195
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,449
and and building and putting trouble to

196
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:29,449
ground on a lot of production capacity

197
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:32,030
in Canada and now we're moving on to IP

198
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,020
creation kind of midstream value and now

199
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,079
looking at distribution deals

200
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,430
internationally so we've still have some

201
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,168
catching up in the production side we're

202
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,810
really excited about the global market

203
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:44,389

institutional investors to invest in

212
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:03,740

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,639
hopefully importing here to Germany for

220
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:18,139
GMP facility and I'm very focused on

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,788
education which has been a theme last

222
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,530
year and this year and create an

223
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:22,550
education program so welcome to come and

224
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,258
talk to me about that but you're not

225
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,900
here to talk about education right now

226
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,520
you're talking about business and how to

227
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,829
make money and you got some of the best

228
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,240
people to talk to about that so I

229
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:33,528
promise I'm going to leave time for

230
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,668
questions cuz I think that's really

231
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:36,379
important I'm sure a lot of you already

232
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:38,449
have some questions and maybe some more

233
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,559
after this discussion so the first

234
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,820
question we're going to talk about are

235
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,319
what are the some of the early

236
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,839
challenges and how are we able to

237
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,110
overcome it in Canada if you want to

238
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,870
start us off max sure I mean challenges

239
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,000
of course regulation which is something

240
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:57,519
everybody in Germany's is clearly aware

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,279
of money it was is a challenge although

242
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,659
the the notion now that in Canada

243
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,970
there's a lot of money and and it's no

244
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:08,029
problem to raise money but still you

245
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,889
need to have a really solid business in

246
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,750
order to do that and in the early days

247
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,850
when the market was just developing and

248
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,299
it was medical only and it was under

249
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,190
conservative government there were times

250
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,899
where it was extremely difficult to

251
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,630
raise money and to build these very

252
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,569
capital-intensive facilities that

253
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:29,210
required a lot of capital expenditure as

254
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,530
well as operational expenditure so those

255
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,810
are definitely the two two biggest

256
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,509
challenges that are gonna be happening

257
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,959
in this German market as well right Phil

258
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,549
Chuck

259
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,690
any thoughts Phil yeah I definitely

260
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:40,009
agree those are the two biggest

261
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,470
challenges that are dealing with the the

262
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:44,179
regulator and also access to capital I

263
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,259
think as you enter into the German

264
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:46,939
market some of the things that you're

265
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,950
gonna want to do is to really educate

266
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,330
yourself on the process really go

267
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,800
through the regulations front to back

268
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,620
and understand everything very

269
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,899
thoroughly and get consultants if you

270
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,730
need to in order to make sure you have a

271
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,799
full understanding and get in front of

272
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,389
it early get your application in early

273
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,019
work with the regulator create a very

274
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,370
friendly relationship with them and

275
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,779
always make sure that you have access to

276
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,940
capital that is a very capital intensive

277
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:15,709
project and I mean kind of echoing

278
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,380
thoughts I certainly need to embrace the

279
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,389
regulations as we know and I think

280
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:22,909
getting out early being a first mover

281
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:24,740
early mover means you're gonna have deal

282
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:27,949
with a lot more uncertainty but I think

283
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,659
this industry rewards early movers pharr

284
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,980
you know greater than than anything else

285
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:32,179
I've seen so you'll it'll always be

286
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,740
worth additional trouble and the

287
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:36,019
regulatory bar always increases over

288
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,299
time you know becoming a licensed

289
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,370
producer you know when we filed in her

290
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:42,500
in 2013 was far easier than it is today

291
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,600
and the application gets gets deeper as

292
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,580
the regular regulator learns how to how

293
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,589
to process so that's that's certainly

294
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,270
key and and that kind of comes down to

295
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:51,589
kind of the the main point I think the

296
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:53,240
challenge is that you got to remember

297
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:54,620
the cannabis I think the opportunity is

298
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,659
a great business opportunity but it's a

299
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,000
political issue above all else and and

300
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:00,769
politics will often from good policy and

301
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,328
so if you don't if you don't embrace it

302
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,278
there's a political

303
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,349
next to this the calculus then you're

304
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:08,509
gonna you know you're gonna be not gonna

305
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,129
enjoy yourself no excellent point and

306
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,329
even on on the regulatory thing just to

307
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:12,889
point oh we were here last year the

308
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:14,838
tender for Germany just came out and

309
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,428
there was a lot of excitement and in

310
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,989
Canada even though it seems pretty

311
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:19,399
perfect from an outside world here we

312
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,869
are five years later I can assure you

313
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,428
when the regulations first came out a

314
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:24,110
lot of people were quite upset and

315
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:25,369
threatened to sue the government so we

316
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,528
went through the same challenges and it

317
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:29,209
just takes time to expand and here we

318
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:30,919
are five years later so that's a good

319
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:33,048
point and you mentioned about raising

320
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,698
money that's a very hot topic right now

321
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:37,548
with so many publicly traded companies

322
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:38,659
here in Canada and listing in Canada and

323
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,769
there's even some American companies

324
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:41,509
just to give you some stats from

325
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,879
Bloomberg as of January there were 84

326
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:45,350
publicly traded companies and there was

327
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,230
were it was worth around 37 billion

328
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,278
dollars as well US companies are now

329
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,860
listening in Canada because Canada

330
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,259
allows for for cannabis listings I'll

331
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,669
although Frankfurt as well and we have a

332
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,110
lot of American companies and even one

333
00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:00,019
Canadian company which got listed on the

334
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,730
Nasdaq and just want to point out it is

335
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,558
a good time to buy they are at a four

336
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,058
month low and I'm not gonna ask these

337
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:07,938
guys which companies they recommend to

338
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:10,789
buy since a couple of more public and

339
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:11,778
one might be soon as well so but we will

340
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:13,219
talk about what are some of the

341
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:14,778
challenges of going public and how do

342
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,579
you know when the right time is to go

343
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:21,168
public well I think when you know tweed

344
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:22,548
was the first company to be publicly

345
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:24,649
traded in Canon the TSX Venture Exchange

346
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:26,629
and the time that we did it it was

347
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:28,399
actually our thinking was because the

348
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,688
advertising restrictions we didn't do it

349
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
for capital reasons I think the whole

350
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:34,248
industry at that time underestimated the

351
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,720
capital requirements and we did it more

352
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:37,548
for publicity you know maybe I'll

353
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,278
advertise your public company etc it was

354
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,778
an advantage now luckily you know we we

355
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,350
had a vehicle many other companies now

356
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:46,639
in Canada are public and I think the you

357
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,860
know obviously the opportunity is having

358
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,230
a currency and be able to move fast

359
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,168
because of the speed of the industry I

360
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,749
think it disproportionate rewards people

361
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:59,928
with with public funds and I think the

362
00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:02,149
challenges are you know with that you do

363
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:04,188
get you do get constrained and I think a

364
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,808
challenge in Canada for publicly traded

365
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:07,399
companies at least on the on the TSX

366
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:10,219
Venture and the TSX is that we can't

367
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,509
play in the US and so we there's a

368
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,620
tremendous amount of deal flow and

369
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:15,060
opportunities that we see

370
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,399
in the United States that we can't touch

371
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,079
that other competitors can and so it's

372
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,669
interesting see how that develops but

373
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,410
certainly you know the global market is

374
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:26,069
is providing a great counterbalance to

375
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:27,419
that yeah I would say if you're pursuing

376
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,640
a public listing the biggest thing now

377
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,528
with 84 public companies and there's a

378
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,120
few more in the pipeline by the end of

379
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:34,049
the year it'll be over a hundred is to

380
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,850
ensure that you have something that

381
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:37,199
really differentiates your story from

382
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,810
other accountable companies you don't

383
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,070
want to be just another story amongst a

384
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,419
sea of stories you want to have

385
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,580
something compelling for investors to

386
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:47,069
believe in and to put their money behind

387
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,770
you don't want to have a business that's

388
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,300
just a generic cannabis company with

389
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,769
with just hopes and dreams you want to

390
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,129
have something tangible something real

391
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,419
that investors can can get behind so I

392
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:59,338
think that's the biggest thing if you're

393
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,610
pursuing a listen and fill anyone else

394
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,170
going public on the stage soon yeah

395
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,639
we're we're in the process of going

396
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:07,919
public we should be listed in June on

397
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,809
the CSC as Chuck mentioned we do have

398
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,399
assets in the United States so we have

399
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,679
to pursue a listing on the CSC rather

400
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,350
than some of the other exchanges just it

401
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,969
all the fun opportunities and do that

402
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,519
Mack some thoughts on going public I

403
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,800
know you do yeah when I started emblem

404
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,019
back in 2013 not in my wildest

405
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,729
imaginations that I think we're gonna

406
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,470
have to be a publicly traded company or

407
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,589
that a cannabis company can even be a

408
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:35,250
publicly traded company let alone so I

409
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:37,230
guess I was a bit naive and you know the

410
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,028
the the reason you do go public of

411
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,550
course is to provide your investors with

412
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:42,958
liquidity and when you're raising money

413
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:45,599
and the amount of money that you have to

414
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,309
raise for for this space in order to

415
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,009
build out your cultivation facilities

416
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:52,500
and your operations you need to give

417
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:55,230
back to the investors and that's why you

418
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,610
do go public but if you don't have to

419
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:02,039
and you can stay private I mean I would

420
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,528
rather do that but I also understand the

421
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,849
need for going public and and why

422
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,309
Canadian companies and other companies

423
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,639
are doing so I think some of the the the

424
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:12,838
race I think you know the the fear that

425
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,179
you know even as a publicly traded

426
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,790
company having that currency access to

427
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,919
capital I mean you know the top 10

428
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:21,929
Canadian companies are raising 100

429
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,189
million Canadian just kind of every now

430
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,208
and then when the market conditions are

431
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,520
right now in the last couple of weeks

432
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,138
but you know the real fear for me is the

433
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,759
you know the

434
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,558
was given the cane industry huge gift

435
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,909
through through the Hilla gallery at a

436
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:34,278
federal level but you know that that

437
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:36,139
will eventually change and we see former

438
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:37,639
Speaker of the House kind of endorsing

439
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:40,039
cannabis and once institutional taps

440
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,629
open in the US we're gonna have a lot of

441
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,599
competition so you know I think we

442
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:47,539
always feel the urgency I think to

443
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,619
continue scaling because although we've

444
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:50,088
had a great amount of scaling that's

445
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,918
taken place you know the industry

446
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:53,269
globally is still in its infancy so it's

447
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,470
still it's still a race I think that's

448
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,119
the challenge and the opportunity of

449
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,918
everybody here is that although Canadian

450
00:15:56,119 --> 00:16:00,439
companies have a I think a great start

451
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:02,088
it's still really early and just on that

452
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:03,528
note everyone always talks about going

453
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,759
public as just a license to print money

454
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:06,379
and there's all this excitement around

455
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,730
it can anyone just touch on a few

456
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:09,739
challenges like what are the negatives

457
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,019
because if anyone's really thinking like

458
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:14,480
all it's all great if anything you

459
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:16,578
publicly talked about of hey it might

460
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,470
not be as sweet as you think oh for sure

461
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:20,988
once once you go public you're under the

462
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,999
microscope and you have shareholders and

463
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,769
you have shareholders from all walks of

464
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:27,109
life and you have a lot of retail

465
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:30,078
investors that are just looking to make

466
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:31,220
money and flip your stock and they don't

467
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,888
understand that you know everything

468
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,499
takes time and you know we're trying to

469
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:38,149
build a real business at emblem and we

470
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:39,678
we do have a real business and we have

471
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:41,058
revenue and we have great products

472
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:42,438
coming out and we have great marketing

473
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:44,899
and branding but it may not be

474
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:46,099
reflective of our share price while

475
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,839
there are other companies who have

476
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,089
higher valuations that don't have a

477
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,980
nickel in sales you know so you have to

478
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,980
take it with it with a grain of salt and

479
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:58,308
obviously being under that microscope a

480
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,249
lot of a lot of people contact myself

481
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:03,289
and our CEO and and sometimes leave us

482
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:04,639
nasty emails about things but that's

483
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,109
just because they don't understand what

484
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:08,328
we're doing and they're not taking the

485
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,219
time to really understand the industry

486
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:12,500
as a whole and they're just looking to

487
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,909
make a quick buck so ya know it's

488
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,130
excellent point another thing what else

489
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,389
dad but yeah I think some of the the

490
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,860
considerations are obviously the

491
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:21,648
transparency yet being under the

492
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,658
microscope and also that there's a

493
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:25,489
significant cost associated with it not

494
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,169
just a financial cost but also a human

495
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,179
capital cost it takes a lot of resources

496
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:31,909
in order to pursue a public listing and

497
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:34,159
maintain that listing and that does put

498
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:36,139
a burden on the management team so if

499
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,429
you are able to stay private and access

500
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,839
capital and your shareholders are

501
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,060
comfortable with that and that's

502
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,159
certainly something worth can see

503
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,799
because it allows the management team to

504
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,180
focus more on the business and less on

505
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,339
the public aspect of the business which

506
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,320
is itself a separate business entirely

507
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:51,819
almost so certainly something to

508
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,589
consider is if you can stay private it

509
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:56,379
does give you more flexibility to pivot

510
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:58,240
and stay nimble in the in the industry

511
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,560
which is a terribly complex one and

512
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,000
there's lots of emerging opportunities

513
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,700
so having that flexibility could be

514
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,349
beneficial for some companies I think

515
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,569
you see the check sizes on private deals

516
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:08,889
getting larger with more global interest

517
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:10,889
so I think you can't stay private a

518
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,730
little bit longer but certainly I think

519
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,150
you know certainly our you know our

520
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,200
experience and senior experience is

521
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,730
given the speed at which the industry is

522
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,830
evolving I still believe that the

523
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,230
default choice is to try to access the

524
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:24,699
capital markets but once you do that you

525
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,690
are you need to scale there's no point

526
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,460
in going public and a diving a

527
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,019
subsequent race so you're going public

528
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,430
you're taking on that burden you now

529
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,230
need to you know you need to scale

530
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,299
probably by another factor of 10 to make

531
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,740
to make that gamble worth it and then

532
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,680
and sometimes lose control your board

533
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,569
yeah excellent points and I could tell

534
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,039
you uh for the longest time every time I

535
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,929
go somewhere people would love to ask me

536
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,000
a question about cannabis use what's

537
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,130
good for my grandmother or what strain

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,750
or a variety I'd recommend and I used to

539
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,920
love that but now a lot of times I tell

540
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,599
them what industry I'm in and they're

541
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,670
like oh what's talk should I invest in

542
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,079
and it gets kind of annoying that way

543
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,880
but I can't imagine what it's like for

544
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,109
you guys I got a party and it's like

545
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,330
what the hell I invested in you

546
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,629
yesterday and I'm down with lapels going

547
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,769
on

548
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,620
well you can't recommend your own stocks

549
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:07,480
I say buy his yeah I was on a family

550
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:10,379
vacation and I I made the error of

551
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,849
tweeting it and I got a tweet response

552
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,230
from from someone I guess who is a

553
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:16,299
shareholder and said how can you be

554
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,049
taking vacation when your stock is on

555
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:22,750
its way down you know and it's like geez

556
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:24,639
people are harsh very harsh and I think

557
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,170
the best lesson for this is that it's a

558
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,610
long game someone said yesterday and I

559
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,289
say the same thing it's a marathon it's

560
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,699
not a race and if you bought something

561
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,470
hoping that you're gonna sell it

562
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,620
tomorrow I don't think any of these guys

563
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,819
have any tears for you it's more of like

564
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,649
a long-term game if you believe in the

565
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:41,439
business you invest and you hold on

566
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,300
until it comes to fruition so some

567
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,620
excellent points and the last question

568
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,569
before we get into your questions is

569
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:48,399
about other cool businesses that you

570
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:50,919
like there's all kinds of different

571
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,450
ancillary products on the side it's all

572
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,820
it's not only about cannabis I'm sure

573
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,950
you probably have heard this

574
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,710
if you haven't it's used a lot in Canada

575
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,150
but they talk about the miners and it

576
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,920
wasn't only the miners that were getting

577
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,600
the gold that made a lot of money it was

578
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,789
the the businesses that supported them

579
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,619
like the jeans the picks the shovels so

580
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,940
that's a very common expression so maybe

581
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,639
we can take a moment to just talk about

582
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,170
it I can start it off I saw there was a

583
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,820
cool business that buys up land and

584
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,220
leases it back there's a few companies

585
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:18,750
that plant properties in a few I'm a big

586
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,170
vaporizer guide this is one I really

587
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,480
like

588
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,890
I can't out of Canada called Arizer if

589
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,390
you want to come check it out come up to

590
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,640
me after I've been showing it off all

591
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,170
this time in Berlin and I'm a big fan so

592
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
those are some cool side businesses

593
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,039
other things that support cannabis that

594
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,849
I'm excited about and maybe you guys can

595
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,019
talk about some of the things that

596
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:37,169
excite you and give them a little

597
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,730
insight scoop sure you know at emblem

598
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,310
although cultivation is a big part of

599
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,289
what we do we're actually reshift in our

600
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:46,279
focus away from cultivation and into

601
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:49,730
more of the value add products

602
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,950
derivatives and concentrates and

603
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,110
pharmaceutical like products as well

604
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,370
we're focusing on on brands because

605
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:57,059
that's where the higher margins are

606
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:00,839
gonna exist

607
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:03,299
ultimately you know cultivation as more

608
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,189
and more operations come online the

609
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,599
price of those operations are going up

610
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,240
but the price of the product is

611
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,589
ultimately going down so you know I

612
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,660
think there's there are tons of

613
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:14,939
ancillary businesses and even as a

614
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,100
licensed producer who produces cannabis

615
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,980
products you know you have to think

616
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:23,730
beyond just cultivation yeah that's an

617
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,440
excellent point for for us what we're

618
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,029
focused on now is taking what we've

619
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,500
learned on the small to medium scale and

620
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:30,599
some of the smaller markets like Oregon

621
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,079
and Nevada and industrializing those

622
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:36,359
processes and using automation so taking

623
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,429
things that are done semi-automatically

624
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:40,529
using some some vape pen fillers and

625
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,940
other automated processes but combining

626
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:43,710
them so that it's fully automated so

627
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,350
that you can actually access a truly

628
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,029
national and international market so

629
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,949
taking something that's been done in

630
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:52,649
Oregon it's only four million people so

631
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,090
you can't really justify the expense of

632
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,670
putting in a fully automated packaging

633
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:58,619
line whereas in Canada there's you know

634
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,930
37 million people we have the

635
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,129
opportunity to export and so our focus

636
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,840
now moving into the next year is

637
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,360
automating the processing so that we can

638
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,470
truly create large volumes of products

639
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,658
to be able to service that Nash

640
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,390
International Opportunity and I think

641
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:13,289
that's gonna be something that really

642
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,580
differentiates us as we move forward

643
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:17,250
because a lot of companies are focused

644
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,569
on large scale cultivation facilities

645
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,419
which we're also doing ourselves we have

646
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:23,399
a 60,000 square metre greenhouse but we

647
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,750
have a 4,000 square metre manufacturing

648
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,580
facility and that's gonna really enable

649
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,230
us to to create millions of units a

650
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,329
month the other thing that I'm excited

651
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,980
about as far as technology as far as

652
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:33,538
emerging opportunities is is in

653
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,640
technologies we've invested into an

654
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:37,230
enterprise resource planning software so

655
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,780
it tracks all of the different costs and

656
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,890
other metrics everything that happens in

657
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,200
our business gets put into this

658
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,409
dashboard and scrubs all the information

659
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,940
and presents it in a very user-friendly

660
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,559
interface so we have real-time business

661
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,500
intelligence to make sensible decisions

662
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:55,440
with and that database as it continues

663
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,119
to grow and and build will allow us to

664
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,980
take that information and be able to

665
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,959
enter new markets in a more timely

666
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,730
manner with more sophistication and more

667
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,890
information behind us those are the

668
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,509
things that weren't excited about Chuck

669
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,980
I know you've got lots of things to be

670
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:10,200
excited about yeah well I mean I think

671
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,390
you know specific ancillary product that

672
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,769
I like is the data that we now see I

673
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,179
mean I shout out to a company that I'm a

674
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,859
customer of BDS analytics out of

675
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,590
Colorado they have great market

676
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,740
segmentation you know bye-bye brand by

677
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:24,990
SKU early charge the charge well for it

678
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,058
but it's it's great data so as you look

679
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,620
to develop your your own products and

680
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:30,089
attack the market it's there's great

681
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:32,250
sources like that developing because I

682
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:34,889
think you know the value is in brands

683
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,329
over time but you know my thesis is that

684
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,650
you know right now you can have the best

685
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:39,899
brand in the world the best consumption

686
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,038
device or our product but unless you

687
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,450
have the input materials to create that

688
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,279
product you're not gonna go anywhere so

689
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,569
people that control brands today are the

690
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:47,788
ones that have cultivation but we know

691
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:49,408
that that will shift and so you see a

692
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:50,819
lot of the you know current people with

693
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:53,909
a lot of production shifting to

694
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:56,399
licensing IP or creating IP to create

695
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:58,860
that brand value and so you know we're

696
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,450
kind of shifting I think in Canada - you

697
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:01,829
know most most companies have the

698
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,990
cultivation that they want or at least

699
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:05,548
that they want to have in kind of in the

700
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,960
queue being built and now it's about

701
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:08,548
where are they gonna put that that

702
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,558
cultivation to get higher margins I'm a

703
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:12,029
huge fan of a pens I think that is a I

704
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,339
think that'd be the most important

705
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:15,960
segment in the market some jurisdictions

706
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:18,599
aren't allowing it yet

707
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,249
that we don't know when it'll come but I

708
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,990
think it's a it's an amazing consumption

709
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,889
method and its really gonna that's I

710
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,179
think that's the biggest threat to

711
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:26,069
alcohol in my view it's pretty exciting

712
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,809
yeah a lot of people are talking about

713
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:29,278
that and just a quick technology since

714
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:31,259
you were mentioning technology there's a

715
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,999
company I know that me and emblem work

716
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,798
with are called strain print and what

717
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:36,749
they do is they analyze people's results

718
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,118
from the cannabis so make it a lot

719
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:40,319
easier to conveyux all the data puts it

720
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:42,538
together and then it makes it easier for

721
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,308
other people to decide what strains are

722
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:45,658
right for them and it allows them to

723
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:47,278
make recommendations so it's a good way

724
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,480
to analyze the data of what your

725
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,898
patients are using to have a better idea

726
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,220
of what your patients want and need so

727
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:54,808
that's a cool technology and you

728
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,368
mentioned also something else that's a

729
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:57,898
danger in here in Germany you might be

730
00:24:56,368 --> 00:25:00,418
surprised to learn I heard how expensive

731
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:02,308
the cannabis is here in Germany and yeah

732
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,840
it's really unfortunate but things are

733
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:05,519
going to change what's happening in

734
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,859
Canada we're having almost people are

735
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,298
saying it's like a commodity price it's

736
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:10,769
right now oil is becoming kind of a

737
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:12,778
commodity and some people are saying

738
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,460
that bud I don't know if anyone can just

739
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:17,220
quickly talk about how do you prevent

740
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,720
from the being a commodity and again

741
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,038
here in Germany because it might be

742
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,778
unfathomable to you to think because

743
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,099
it's selling for so expensive here it

744
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:24,749
might be difficult to comprehend but

745
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:27,209
here in Canada the pressure is on the

746
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:31,079
price to go down how do we prevent that

747
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,548
any any thoughts yeah I think especially

748
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,808
in the recreational market in Canada the

749
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:35,849
provinces are gonna have a lot of buying

750
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:37,528
power the the way that it's set up in

751
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:39,118
Canada is the province are is

752
00:25:37,528 --> 00:25:40,319
responsible for distribution so they're

753
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:42,658
gonna be buying from the licensed

754
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,038
producers they have to build in two sets

755
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,600
of margins they have a wholesale margin

756
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:46,888
and retail margins that means that the

757
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,719
price that they end up paying is gonna

758
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:50,788
be around two to three dollars per gram

759
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,200
and we just have to look at the alcohol

760
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:53,999
industry and see that that's the same

761
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,269
case if you buy a $20 bottle of wine

762
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:59,519
from from a provincial retailer the the

763
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,839
winery actually gets about $4 or $5 out

764
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,700
of that so they're getting 20 or 25

765
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,230
percent of the retail price the

766
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,679
estimated retail price in Canada is

767
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,360
about $10 so assuming the same happens

768
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,610
in the cannabis industry it's gonna be

769
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,808
about $2 to 250 once the market matures

770
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:15,089
initially there's gonna be a lack of

771
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:16,950
supply so I think that the prices will

772
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:19,109
stay high for the first year or two but

773
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,100
inevitably once that oversupply does hit

774
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:21,689
the market there's going to be a

775
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:24,058
significant price compression and that's

776
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,769
gonna have producers that are just

777
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:27,538
focused on flour they're going to be

778
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:28,319
very they're going to see their margins

779
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:29,158
of road because

780
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,960
they are gonna have a lot of price

781
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,299
compression a lot of pressure from other

782
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,610
producers to to meet the revenue targets

783
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:37,918
as public companies and so I think the

784
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:39,418
best way for companies to try to avoid

785
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,309
that is to focus on the value-added

786
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,288
products just like emblems doing in

787
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,690
ourselves because you're able to take

788
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:47,548
those input materials and as that price

789
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,259
comes down it actually means that those

790
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:51,028
producers their margins are going to

791
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,288
erode our margins are going to increase

792
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:54,210
because our input costs are going to

793
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,710
come down we're gonna be able to source

794
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,509
from other producers we're not gonna be

795
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,669
able to supply everything ourselves for

796
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:02,639
our output so I think that positions our

797
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:05,009
companies very well in in that eventual

798
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:08,339
economic situation I think you know we

799
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:10,230
see on the product side although the the

800
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:12,689
raw input material can get commoditized

801
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,000
you know we have you know one producer

802
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,190
can a hydroponic air selling a spray and

803
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,829
I think the the per gram equivalent

804
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,808
price of that spray ends up being about

805
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:23,609
I think it's 60 or 70 dollars a grams

806
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:26,009
when you turn your pro actually in

807
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:27,449
productize your cannabis you get a lot

808
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:28,528
of there's a lot of margin that can be

809
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,179
compressed I think that's a very

810
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:31,288
interesting thing but certainly you know

811
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,269
in the record market that's the last

812
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:34,558
place I want to put my product because

813
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:35,788
you're gonna get squeezed you're getting

814
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,859
intermediated with a wholesaler and a

815
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:39,628
retailer the first place you want to put

816
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,918
product as the medical market in Canada

817
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:42,480
but that's a small market then it goes

818
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,950
to really places like Germany the

819
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,870
international medical markets are the

820
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,819
best markets so I think you're you know

821
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:48,989
you as can companies you want to be if

822
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,308
we're all we're all looking at pursue

823
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,378
those international opportunities that

824
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:55,349
that is the best opportunity for us and

825
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:57,509
just to echo some some thoughts you guys

826
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:59,638
made yet definitely to differentiate you

827
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:02,490
want to be a higher quality producer I

828
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:05,128
think you want to have unique products

829
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,679
and another thing that you can over lick

830
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:10,378
look is you have to have strength and

831
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,659
distribution so you know emblem has a

832
00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:14,339
partnership with a very large pharmacy

833
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,740
chain in Canada called Shoppers Drug

834
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:19,048
Mart and where we have a few other

835
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,849
distribution arrangements and and I know

836
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:23,398
Chuck's involved with national access

837
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:24,869
that is also focusing on distribution so

838
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:26,548
you know having the right retail

839
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,349
partners and the relationships with

840
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:29,908
those retail partners and distribution

841
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:31,829
points even though some of them are

842
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:32,700
provinces is going to be extremely

843
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:35,398
important as well

844
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,798
and national axis just signed a deal

845
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:40,500
with the big coffee shop chain in Canada

846
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,519
just read that on the news yes I see

847
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,190
coffee going a pot

848
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,099
it's a good it's good pot of coffee yeah

849
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,740
and Tokyo smoke it's very popular in

850
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,579
Canada mixin coffee and cannabis I don't

851
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,440
know if they actually mix it together

852
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,029
but you can do both in the same some are

853
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,799
they gonna allow it yet but it'll get

854
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:59,279
there okay yeah look the concept is

855
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,809
there so great great discussion I I felt

856
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,210
it was really important to leave time to

857
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:04,649
for questions I feel like we've always

858
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,809
run out of time for questions so I

859
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,060
wanted to leave a good amount of time so

860
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:18,240
open it up well done let's hear it for

861
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:20,549
the panel coffee I don't know if this

862
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,740
translates but in in America we call

863
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:26,849
coffee and cannabis the hippie speedball

864
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,089
that's a whole new meaning for coffee

865
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:33,000
pot coffee pot is pretty good picks you

866
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,889
up and calms you down thanks very much

867
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,960
for sharing your experiences yesterday

868
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,240
we heard from an importer into Germany

869
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,180
of Canadian products how important it

870
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,289
was to have clinical studies I was

871
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,000
wondering whether you have any

872
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:47,639
experience with clinical studies in

873
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,160
Canada that could perhaps stand up to

874
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,800
the standard that could provoke provide

875
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:58,230
a medical benefit claim so we will be

876
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:01,980
venturing into clinical studies through

877
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:04,049
our educational arm and clinic operation

878
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:07,019
grow wise we we have been doing a lot of

879
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:09,750
observational trials and and have been

880
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:11,910
collecting data through the patients

881
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,579
there on their experience with cannabis

882
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,410
and different strains they use but yes

883
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,699
clinical trials is something that's

884
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,410
going to become more important

885
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,819
especially if you want to export and

886
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:25,380
especially if you want to really

887
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:28,950
legitimize cannabis as a drug that's

888
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,120
distributed like like other drugs so we

889
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,039
don't have I don't have any direct

890
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,689
experience with it yet but it's it's

891
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,210
something that our company will be

892
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,160
focusing on in the next little bit I

893
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,519
think I think certainly there there are

894
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,650
a number of a number of institutions and

895
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,940
companies that working on clinical

896
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,110
studies in Canada I think you know when

897
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,240
I'm familiar with is that national

898
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:51,059
access cannabis you know being a clinic

899
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,289
model direct patient interaction clinics

900
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,889
in Canada are really been the ones that

901
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:56,109
are been driving the

902
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,550
you know the physician engaging with

903
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:59,829
patients and people get access to the

904
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,509
medical system but it's opiate reduction

905
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:03,389
I think that's the anecdotal evidence is

906
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:06,069
I think it's pretty overwhelming on

907
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,930
reducing opiates with cannabis but those

908
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:09,700
studies there's a number of opiate

909
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,160
reduction and replacement studies taking

910
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,450
place I think that'll be a huge key on

911
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,240
paying positions have been the most open

912
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,440
to prescribing cannabis you know because

913
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,430
they know they know what the alternative

914
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,529
is

915
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,029
and when when those clinical studies get

916
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:24,129
results I think we'll Steve it'll be a

917
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:26,079
great tool especially for new markets to

918
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:30,460
really break through the the medical

919
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:32,559
taboo barrier yeah we just started two

920
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,329
weeks ago a preclinical trial to to

921
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,669
study the effects of cannabinoids era P

922
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:39,129
on heart arrhythmias and dravet syndrome

923
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:41,080
so a type of seizure and so we're just

924
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,340
starting that research now and we're

925
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,199
hoping to get some results by the end of

926
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:46,539
the year which will help to guide a more

927
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,250
formal clinical trial and so that's

928
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:49,750
already underway and then we're pursuing

929
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,579
a couple of other clinical trials as

930
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,829
well under a few other different disease

931
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:55,720
states so that'll be coming forward in

932
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:57,549
the next few months yeah Chuck you

933
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,720
touched on something big crisis in

934
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,460
Canada right now we have an opiate

935
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,890
crisis around 4,000 people died last

936
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,360
year it's already accelerating this year

937
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,160
what I find interesting I'm learning a

938
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,869
lot about the German that they're very

939
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,700
chemical culture there's a lot of drugs

940
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:11,649
being used in Germany but when I talk

941
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,789
about opiates that it's not doesn't seem

942
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,320
like it's such a problem I don't know if

943
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:16,480
it's something that is going to happen

944
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,549
or somehow Germany can avoid it but it's

945
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,110
a big problem in Canada and finding that

946
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:21,609
cannabis can be used as a either

947
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:24,189
complimentary so don't use as much

948
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:26,019
opiates or as a replacement I think that

949
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,250
could be huge but just a thing I want to

950
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,329
point out also when people say there's

951
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,920
not enough research because I hear that

952
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:32,470
all the time I tell them to go to a

953
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,110
website called PubMed PU bmed

954
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,600
type in the word cannabis and notice the

955
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:40,240
twenty thousand-plus

956
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,949
articles of research there and then tell

957
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,480
me that there's no research I mean that

958
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,029
there's tons of research maybe not as

959
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,039
what some be like but there's lots there

960
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:49,569
and I believe in collaboration for

961
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,680
research I hope we all can do

962
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:52,299
collaboration there's no point of us

963
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,920
investing our own research because it's

964
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:56,259
going to help us all it's about working

965
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,000
together as producers and then worldwide

966
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:59,440
who's doing something in Germany who's

967
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,509
doing something in Toronto how do we

968
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,789
work together we've seen PTSD trials

969
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:05,680
pain trials at a McGill by dr. mark

970
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:07,659
where who's doing some great stuff in

971
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,730
Canada with the CC I see the

972
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,460
Canadian cannabinoid investigative

973
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,230
consortium so it's really important the

974
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,870
research so thanks very good question

975
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,059
another question yeah in a minute but I

976
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,829
just wanted to your point where the

977
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:23,009
opiate and there have been studies in

978
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:25,869
America that in states that have legal

979
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:28,750
appeal overdoses in opiate deaths go

980
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:30,219
down 25% absolutely right and so

981
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,859
exciting they're they're realizing that

982
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,620
cannabis isn't a gateway to harder drugs

983
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:37,000
but it's a pathway away right I say that

984
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:39,819
I like to say it's an exit drug not a

985
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,710
not a and also something to point out

986
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:44,379
that not only does opiate use go down

987
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:47,470
but suicide goes down physical abuse

988
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:50,800
alcoholism so a lot of other ills go

989
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,630
down as well what what role do you see

990
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,220
for economic development economic

991
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,350
development agencies so I'm from one of

992
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,690
the provinces and we've been very

993
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:01,869
focused on on this industry so just

994
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:04,390
which province New Brunswick welcome

995
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:05,619
thoughts I mean great to see New

996
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,090
Brunswick a there take really taking a

997
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:10,000
leadership role I met with several

998
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:12,009
individuals from no other province seems

999
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,168
to be attending these events so it's any

1000
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,389
other provinces here anyone yeah oh

1001
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:18,009
we've got one here you know we have we

1002
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,990
have ten provinces a few territories but

1003
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,870
it's I think it speaks to the fact that

1004
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:24,158
most of our our local governments and

1005
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:25,299
and provincial governments are not

1006
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,269
really engaged on this file they're

1007
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,980
being forced by by the federal mandate

1008
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:31,509
the kane system started through the

1009
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,519
courts we have a federal government that

1010
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,340
is very pro or at least it's going

1011
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,139
through with legalization but it's you

1012
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,000
know it's a lot more engaged to be had i

1013
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,099
think we see actually New Brunswick

1014
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,929
providing job grants and hiring grants

1015
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:46,360
really normalizing the industry so I

1016
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,320
think the the opportunity is to keep

1017
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,169
engaged with government through

1018
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,340
traditional channels and firfer you know

1019
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:54,398
whether there's tax credits or other

1020
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,980
innovation funds to to normalize that

1021
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,989
but it's it's a slow process through my

1022
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,769
experience it really can vary province

1023
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:04,029
to province and I think again from my

1024
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:07,329
experience one of the most

1025
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,400
forward-thinking provinces in cannabis

1026
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:11,170
is Alberta and their economic

1027
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,490
development teams are are quite

1028
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,849
interested especially in the City of

1029
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:18,189
Calgary where you know they want a

1030
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:21,329
economic diversity because it's a very

1031
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:25,519
natural resource have a economy

1032
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:28,739
and and and and it's very nice to see

1033
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:31,230
provinces that are supporting cannabis

1034
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:32,939
and not trying to shut the door or make

1035
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,349
it more complicated than already is I

1036
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,200
think just going to the tone to the

1037
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:38,309
European sector I think the those

1038
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,259
conversations be few and far between

1039
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:41,519
here you know as far as dealing with

1040
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,170
officials but I think it's a great time

1041
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,179
to start building those bridges making

1042
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,130
those connections you're not gonna get

1043
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:48,719
anywhere but this for a few people

1044
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,550
knocking on those doors so I think now

1045
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,589
is the time to really just just start

1046
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,930
that process and engaging with your

1047
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:56,190
local officials and going back to the

1048
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:58,319
political issue you know you want to be

1049
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,760
known to those officials when when the

1050
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,830
starting gun goes off in whatever

1051
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,410
jurisdiction you're in making sure that

1052
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:06,539
people know you and you be able to use

1053
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:08,609
the users lobbying or engaging with

1054
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,349
officials as a point a credibility to

1055
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,510
accelerate your business plans yeah

1056
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:13,739
lobbying that's not a swear word it's

1057
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,790
something that needs to be done and

1058
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:18,989
really look it up right it's okay yes

1059
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:20,340
yeah I would say that I'd really

1060
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:22,649
encourage people to engage their

1061
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,150
economic development teams within

1062
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,980
whatever jurisdiction they're in it is a

1063
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:30,180
very capital intensive industry so if

1064
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,619
there's any help that different regions

1065
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:34,500
can offer companies then that certainly

1066
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,789
is very beneficial for for cannabis

1067
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,079
companies helps to offset a lot of the

1068
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:40,159
cost whether it's through some tax

1069
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,000
incentives credits and so forth

1070
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,409
additionally it's really great for the

1071
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,659
local economies because there is a lot

1072
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:47,489
of jobs being created and I think that

1073
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,259
the the biggest challenge is on the

1074
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:50,819
regulatory front so forging out

1075
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,490
relationship with people who are in

1076
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,170
government and in with the regulator can

1077
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:56,519
be very beneficial strategically for

1078
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,619
your company so I'd really encourage it

1079
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,059
for anybody who's considering it yeah

1080
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,500
and New Brunswick you should be really

1081
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,820
proud of here they're doing some great

1082
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,829
things there to support businesses

1083
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,050
because it creates a lot of jobs and a

1084
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:08,579
lot of good-paying jobs so it's really

1085
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,350
smart to support these types of

1086
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:13,469
businesses and just quickly you know

1087
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:16,110
where you're located in Canada is very

1088
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:18,449
important and emblems located in lovely

1089
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,340
Paris Ontario that's right Paris Ontario

1090
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:23,429
it doesn't look anything like Paris

1091
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:25,320
France but you know what's important is

1092
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:27,239
we're very close to the municipal

1093
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,250
government they're they're very

1094
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:33,419
supportive we couldn't have asked for

1095
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:35,909
for a better support of local government

1096
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,710
than we have in Paris Ontario fantastic

1097
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:43,289
all right well time for one quick one

1098
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:44,760
and then okay hi my name is Harry just a

1099
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:46,860
wondering you were talking earlier about

1100
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,590
one of the challenges being getting

1101
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:52,920
capital to grow your business at the

1102
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:56,160
same time we see market valuations that

1103
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,829
recognize we had in the dot-com age 17

1104
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,989
18 years ago what are your views on the

1105
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:04,610
risk that the money coming into this

1106
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:06,629
business is creating a green bubble

1107
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,490
green bubble I don't know if I've heard

1108
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,050
that one before I would say that there's

1109
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:11,849
a lot of money institutional money in

1110
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,810
the United States and elsewhere in the

1111
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:14,909
world it's still sitting on the

1112
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:16,079
sidelines waiting for the industry to

1113
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:18,210
develop we're still in the early stages

1114
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,340
of the of the industries there's still a

1115
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,619
lot of growth opportunity so once that

1116
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,750
money does come into the industry it's

1117
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,309
going to continue to drive share prices

1118
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,440
up and continue to appreciate the

1119
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:30,299
valuation of these companies Canada is

1120
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,980
positioned very favorably in the world

1121
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,510
because we do have access to an export

1122
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,250
market so it's not just based on our

1123
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,140
domestic Canadian market but we do have

1124
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,179
that early mover advantage until their

1125
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:41,549
markets so I still see a lot of upside

1126
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:43,469
moving forward into the the years ahead

1127
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,340
as the companies continue to develop I

1128
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:46,500
think that if you're going to be

1129
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,900
investing invest long term if you're

1130
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,960
looking for short term picks then you

1131
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,400
know that's your day trading and really

1132
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,530
at the end of the day what's important

1133
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,349
is to pick your horse and to pick your

1134
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,150
jockeys and and support them and don't

1135
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:01,769
get caught up in the day-to-day because

1136
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,150
everybody is focused on the last month

1137
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:05,070
or two how the prices have been so

1138
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,300
volatile but they forget about the run

1139
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,590
ups that have happened for the last

1140
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,960
couple of years and sure there's a

1141
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,730
short-term trough where things have come

1142
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,340
down and corrected perhaps a little bit

1143
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,329
but the the trend is upwards you know

1144
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,470
you look at the charts for the last

1145
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:18,119
couple of years and they're they're only

1146
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:21,119
going in one direction aside from this

1147
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,589
short-term pullback we've had in the

1148
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,299
last couple of months but I really see

1149
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,460
the upside opportunity is still

1150
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,670
tremendous for cannabis companies and

1151
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,139
it's still more solid and cryptocurrency

1152
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,579
sorry sorry if any crypto guys out there

1153
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:36,679
just little there goes popular

1154
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:38,750
if it already exists to add more time

1155
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:40,489
