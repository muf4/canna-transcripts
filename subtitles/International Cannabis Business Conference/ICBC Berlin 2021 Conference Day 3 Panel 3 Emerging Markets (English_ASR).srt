1
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:11,679
hi icbc this is awesome right second day

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,079
third day for some of us um we're going

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,640
to be discussing for the next hour

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,118
uh cannabis and emerging markets which

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,278
is actually a really really fascinating

6
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,118
topic um because at least we were

7
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,719
discussing in the green room there is

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,640
really no such thing as a cannabis

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,198
market that really is not an emerging

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,439
market but i think that we have some

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,439
really interesting uh panelists today

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,359
who are going to give us a perspective

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,119
of what it means to be an emerging

14
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:41,200
market some of the issues that are going

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:43,439
on um and how to to work successfully in

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,320
your emerging market as well as

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,558
inter-emerging market so i think we we

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,039
have everybody's name is up here but we

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,799
have really really wonderful people to

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,000
discuss what's going on in the uk and

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,919
ireland in greece in zimbabwe and new

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
zealand plus of course we'd like to get

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,600
your questions as we go forward because

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,960
we'd like this to be an interesting

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,640
conversation so my first question to all

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,079
of you and you can

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,599
depending on you don't have to answer

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,400
this but i think it'd be really great

29
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,359
what is your definition of an emerging

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,359
cannabis market

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,118
any one of you jump in

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
okay great uh why not uh morning

33
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,319
everybody um

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,799
so i suppose in in in the sense of an

35
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,199
emerging market i would say um it would

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,439
be to a point post legalization where

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,560
there is actually implementation of a

38
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,199
of a of

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,280
a supply chain and access to patients or

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
patient access to certainly

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
qualified medicine on scale i think you

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
know

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,240
canada has it

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
uh certain states in the u.s has it

45
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,359
nowhere really outside of those

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
those locations actually have

47
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,478
so you can classify every other region

48
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,158
as an emerging market

49
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,759
for the for for the sake of this

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
conversation for the sake of this panel

51
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,478
to give it some context i think what we

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,599
are seeing in europe what we're seeing

53
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:09,598
in latin what we're seeing in uh in

54
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:13,039
in asia and in australia is really the

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,119
kind of the development in unison of new

56
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,959
access programs for patients all around

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,039
the world and because there isn't a

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,280
blueprint or certainly the blueprint of

59
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,120
what went on in north america isn't

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,439
exactly the one to follow when it comes

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,319
to these emerging markets you're seeing

62
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,159
new models being implemented across

63
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,039
across the globe and that's really

64
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,359
really exciting to try and

65
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,199
to try and cover and analyze but for

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,680
companies wanting to operate and

67
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,439
certainly scale their business is

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,319
exceptionally complex

69
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,318
well you're you're in in ireland and the

70
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,839
uk right that's one kind of emerging

71
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,679
market maybe constance you can talk

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,439
about greece because i'd like to talk a

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,599
little bit more about an emerging market

74
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,759
clearly in europe

75
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,359
what do you see is your definition is it

76
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,359
export focused is it a cultivation

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,760
infrastructure is it having a cannabis

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,159
agency what are the kinds of things that

79
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,598
are i mean your idea is is a definition

80
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,120
of an emerging cannabis market from

81
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,280
greece sure thank you margaret uh well

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,000
i think that the cannabis industry as a

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,919
whole is an emerging industry so even if

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,479
we talk about north america canada

85
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,799
there's still room to grow

86
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,158
in terms of people that have access to

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,680
the products

88
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,919
in terms of

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
cultivation manufacturing

90
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,518
and more importantly what i see the

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
biggest

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,239
bottleneck of the industry is the

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,159
legislation so there's room to grow on

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,640
every vertical

95
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,079
in particular greece i mean it was one

96
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,878
of the first european countries actually

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,319
that started to form some kind of

98
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,318
regulation to allow for

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
to allow for the industry to grow

100
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,079
and

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,159
most of the politicians saw it from you

102
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
know as an economic opportunity

103
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,399
and unfortunately that left patients

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,799
behind quite a bit and

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,799
20 2018 is when legislation started

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,239
big ambiguities and legislation in terms

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
of what could be

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,759
produced in the country

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
basically there was a very big

110
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,120
bottleneck that allowed only for

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
finished products so you could only make

112
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,720
side effects or dialects

113
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,959
and as you can understand that was

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
really not something marketable so a lot

115
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,478
of licenses started to go out i think in

116
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,719
the first year there was about 100

117
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,039
licenses we're about a little less than

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
200 right now three years later

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,319
and

120
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,959
it's really interesting because in

121
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,560
greece up until a few months ago

122
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,359
the um

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
we have both the ruling government party

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,879
as well as the opposition supporting

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,879
cannabis so greece did an amendment in

126
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,360
legislation a few months ago

127
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,199
and kind of tried to clarify as to what

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
can be produced under what conditions

129
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,478
and eventually

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
you know what how products will be able

131
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,879
to get registered in order to allow for

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
exports and primarily flower

133
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,199
well

134
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,198
you know

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,879
it's still not final so there's still

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
it's still an emerging market in what

137
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,560
sense right now legislation allows for

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,960
the cultivation of flower

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,759
and it's export as long as you're

140
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,599
manufacturing a second product that's at

141
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
least registered in the country you're

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
mentioning you're bringing up a very

143
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,120
very interesting discussion and i think

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,280
one of the the key aspects of emerging

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,038
markets is maybe

146
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,519
products are designed either for export

147
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,279
or you're importing them um i'd like to

148
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,839
kind of go down to boniface because

149
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,239
you're coming from africa right which is

150
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,000
a very cool emerging market not only

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
bringing stuff to europe but inter

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
africa maybe you can talk about some of

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
the challenges and and what it means to

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,680
be an emerging market from zimbabwe

155
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,719
indeed um i'm boniface i'm from zimbabwe

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
um

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,120
i can't see without these so i'm not

158
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,280
that weird i was trying to hide his eyes

159
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,959
and then

160
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,879
in zimbabwe we just exported our first

161
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,918
crop last month

162
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,600
we have more than 55 licenses and out of

163
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,279
those 55

164
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,680
less than six

165
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,000
producing

166
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,720
the challenge that we have right now is

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,680
from a regulatory standpoint

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
what we have is

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,000
we have a

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,399
cannabis industry that is still in the

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,720
fledgling stages

172
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,198
what i mean by that is

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
there is confusion in regulation the

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,120
regulation is not clear

175
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,279
so bringing in products and taking

176
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
products out is still a little bit of a

177
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,079
challenge i'll give you an example in

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,039
south africa

179
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,639
there's a

180
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,800
canadian company

181
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
that just

182
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,439
went through the process of cultivating

183
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
a lot of crop that they were not able to

184
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,598
export

185
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,079
so

186
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,759
some of the challenges that we're facing

187
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,079
they come from

188
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,879
guys like yourselves who are well

189
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,639
intentioned and then you come to africa

190
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,319
then you want to be a cowboy you don't

191
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
want to play with me you want to do your

192
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
own thing

193
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,520
it makes business difficult

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
in in terms of

195
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,680
just getting what you want work with the

196
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,839
locals and you get what you want

197
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,478
and

198
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:21,439
uh secondly in terms of uh

199
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,719
how we're working there's a

200
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:27,839
i think an issue with regards to the

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,080
work that it takes to get uh the

202
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,359
cannabis to be exported or to be

203
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,680
imported

204
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,160
i mentioned to my friends here that

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
everyone likes to eat sausage but no one

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,680
likes to make sausage it's a very nasty

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,879
process

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
so

209
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,478
you come to africa i'll do the nasty

210
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,878
business for you

211
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,519
we will do the nasty business for you

212
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,360
together we'll get something done i'm

213
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,758
here to talk about zimbabwe i'm here to

214
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,319
talk about the opportunities that exist

215
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,639
in zimbabwe we have great factor

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,120
endowments you can come

217
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,720
we have land we have sunshine

218
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,759
we have a lot more

219
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,080
to offer than what you traditionally get

220
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,439
down here bring your expertise to

221
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:14,079
zimbabwe and you make way more money

222
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,399
than doing a business here

223
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,198
paul this is this is my next question so

224
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,878
with that advertisement for zimbabwe um

225
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
how would you say the emerging market in

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,160
new zealand is developing in terms of

227
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,239
both the creation of a domestic market

228
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,160
and of course exports which are now

229
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,158
starting to come to europe

230
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,918
thank you margaret uh yeah so even

231
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,439
though new zealand might not really seem

232
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,199
like a an

233
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,959
emerging market from the outside because

234
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
they have really modern regulations in

235
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,958
place already have the cannabis agency

236
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,278
that is also cooperating with the german

237
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,199
cannabis agency and

238
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,120
it is really that they came up with this

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
medicinal cannabis scheme just in april

240
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,839
last year and the goal of that was to

241
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,720
really supply the market with some

242
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,959
domestic high quality product because

243
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,399
all that was available until then

244
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,319
was just really

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
like prices were really high and

246
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,320
everything needed to be imported so what

247
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,919
they tried is they

248
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,800
awarded around 40 licenses so around 30

249
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,000
for

250
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,479
cultivation and 10 for distribution and

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
manufacturing and now

252
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
with this emerging process and still the

253
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,240
new zealand government realizing that

254
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,759
maybe some of the restrictions they put

255
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,200
in place because they wanted to go

256
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,439
really really strict so they looked at

257
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,959
the german market which is obviously for

258
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
most international companies the most

259
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,879
relevant market they they took germany

260
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,199
as an example and added some more

261
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,600
challenges to it i would say so that

262
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,920
means they added some extra testing so

263
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,360
for example to be registered in new

264
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,919
zealand as

265
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,680
a medicinal cannabis product you have to

266
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,679
comply with or

267
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,679
they will test your product for six to

268
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,879
nine pesticides and have some additional

269
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,239
micro microbial testing applied to it so

270
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,360
this is really really hard and they

271
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
realized that some of the other

272
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,200
bureaucracy around it maybe they went a

273
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
bit too far so now they're that they're

274
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,480
going back a bit as well on that so it's

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
still emerging so and this is like in

276
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
other places around the world this is

277
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,759
why it takes a bit longer for the new

278
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,839
zealand companies to actually have their

279
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,919
first harvest and comply with all these

280
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,279
regulations well this is really

281
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,278
interesting let's let's get to that

282
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,679
point right so i think several of you

283
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,078
here are from company countries that are

284
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,639
really thinking about exporting right

285
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,479
obviously the uk and stephen is in the

286
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,000
uk and ireland that's more i don't want

287
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,240
to diss the weather but that's more of

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,078
an import market how what would be your

289
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
recommendations to people out there

290
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,359
about

291
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,799
you know minding the gaps so if you're

292
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
an emerging market and you want to

293
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,278
export to germany or you want to export

294
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,518
to another country how would you

295
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,039
recommend that that process begins to

296
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,320
start especially

297
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,399
you know from a company perspective

298
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,519
especially as regulations are also

299
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,039
evolving

300
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,039
to your point because it's just about

301
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,958
everywhere

302
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:59,199
yeah well like i think 99 of countries

303
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,518
and locations should be import

304
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
you know i think we as a as an industry

305
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
are so caught up in

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
the site of cultivation we forget about

307
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,319
the rest of the supply chain

308
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,759
and countries ultimately forget about

309
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
the rest of supply chain so great wave

310
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,200
product but how do we actually get it

311
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,240
implemented into the hands of patient

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,959
and once the process behind

313
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,440
reimbursement and so forth and

314
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,799
there is so much talk of cultivation

315
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,560
cultivation and product and yes

316
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,000
obviously it is exceptionally important

317
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,759
but there's one or two facilities in

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,919
europe alone that can cater for the rest

319
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,000
of the demand that europe will need for

320
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,679
the next five years and you know nobody

321
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
talks about that elephant in the room in

322
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,759
terms of how much cultivation actually

323
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,839
happens we only need to look at canada

324
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,838
there was a great article um two weeks

325
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
ago by matt lammers from mj biz who

326
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,760
talked about 80 of of cannabis being

327
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,479
produced that has been destroyed too

328
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,319
early down to uh pure uh purely down to

329
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,399
kind of ignorance when it comes to

330
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
mapping the forecasted demand and also

331
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,480
the understanding in terms of who the

332
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,278
customers were and what they wanted

333
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,519
so

334
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,159
you know the the focus of import and

335
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,278
export and the rush to cultivation

336
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,919
i think is is is is overvalued and

337
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,600
certainly uh over forced by the hands of

338
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,439
the investors who want to see

339
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,278
significant capital returns because that

340
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
is ultimately where you know you are

341
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,600
seeing the the large multiples

342
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,200
traditionally come from um but you know

343
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
i i do think that there is sufficient

344
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
supply

345
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,599
in you know in production or in

346
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,000
production cycle to cater for

347
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,240
cater for demand in europe for the next

348
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,278
10 years easily

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,079
so you know there is there is there is

350
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,159
obviously um

351
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,479
a benefit of having domestic supply and

352
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,360
not being reliable reliable on you know

353
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,000
reliable on on on anybody else but you

354
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,919
know this is just another this is just

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,759
another supply chain just another

356
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,278
product at the end of the day so why

357
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,039
should it be different to anything else

358
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,278
that that exists and there's no other

359
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,199
industry that takes this i suppose

360
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,519
domestic first approach where everything

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,680
needs to be integrated in the country

362
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,959
uh to in order to in order to you know

363
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,838
achieve growth

364
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,439
so

365
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,480
the uk is the uk well the uk is

366
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,399
is is import and export but it's export

367
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,159
for for for a very

368
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
specific circumstance and it's only

369
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,278
starting to emerge in terms of

370
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,919
providing domestic cultivation

371
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,399
and licenses and you know there is huge

372
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,399
risk associated with cultivation and

373
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,639
whereas what the uk has probably

374
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,078
benefited more from is looking at

375
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,079
innovation around the plant so the

376
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,078
science around the plant but also the

377
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,919
the supply chain so everything from

378
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,078
delivery services to

379
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,120
clinics to doctor education and they

380
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:44,000
have kind of built these elements out

381
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,519
that has benefited the patient now

382
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,759
there's obviously still issues around

383
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,000
pricing and still issues around um

384
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,278
around consistency and supply but that

385
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,919
is i

386
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,720
that is probably common

387
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,559
and common in every emerging industry in

388
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,959
every emerging market so these are these

389
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,479
are kind of growing pains that exist in

390
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,479
the uk i don't think

391
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
it's it's as a result of not having

392
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
domestic cultivation i think it's just

393
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
as a result of you know capital being

394
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,120
exceptionally tight in any emerging

395
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
industry well i i'd like i think the uk

396
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,159
at least in my opinion i think the uk is

397
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,679
a little bit of different than say

398
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,120
greece or new zealand or zimbabwe i'd

399
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,399
like to come back to costas for a second

400
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,639
i mean i think one of the issues in

401
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
greece is obviously there's a clear

402
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,278
focus on the export market but there has

403
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,600
also been i think going forward a real

404
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,600
focus on trying to also make sure that

405
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
greek patients can get

406
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,040
you know cannabis themselves maybe you

407
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,959
can talk a little bit about that yeah i

408
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,879
think that there's quite a few more

409
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,278
european countries that

410
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,838
don't allow patient access it's not only

411
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,838
greece

412
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,159
but what was your question i think i

413
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
think what from your perspective what

414
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,919
are some of the challenges that

415
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,000
companies face in greece obviously they

416
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,439
want to make money they want to satisfy

417
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,278
their investors and they want to export

418
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,120
but a lot of people that i'm talking to

419
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,278
definitely also want to help patients

420
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,519
and develop the local markets how would

421
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,838
you how would you suggest that you know

422
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,759
well i would say what is your opinion on

423
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
how that is proceeding in greece what

424
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,159
are the challenges and how do you think

425
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
that the industry itself can rise to

426
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,600
that i think most people want to make

427
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,839
sure that patients everywhere get stuff

428
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,480
not just if you're exporting to

429
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,680
another country well it is uh

430
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,800
you know cannabis has always been

431
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,838
political so i think that uh the biggest

432
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,919
issue for

433
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,680
the european union you know in its

434
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,759
respective countries it's country

435
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,399
members uh

436
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,680
you know the political risk of

437
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,360
applying

438
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,799
some form of you know cannabis

439
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,959
legalization

440
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,240
and allowing the you know intro-european

441
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,159
trade

442
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,919
it carries a lot of risk

443
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,559
and a lot of the political parties are

444
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,799
very uh afraid of house that is going to

445
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,278
interpret to their uh

446
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,919
the voters however i think that we're

447
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,360
getting more and more evidence of um you

448
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,719
know with what's happening in the united

449
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,159
states what's up you know what happened

450
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,240
in canada uh mexico that

451
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,838
there's a lot more pressure now that

452
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,839
this is a real industry and more

453
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,279
importantly it's an entry that affects

454
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
you know sick people

455
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,600
to one extent but at the same time you

456
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
know it's about a well-being of the

457
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
citizens so

458
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,879
i think that what we're going to start

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,639
to see in the very near future is as

460
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,879
people you know as the industry becomes

461
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,278
more legitimate and legitimate mean

462
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,039
meaning you know there's actually uh

463
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,320
because the first couple of years year

464
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,319
and a half there was a lot of wishful

465
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,600
thinking a lot of licenses and you know

466
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
it's going to be a you know half a

467
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,759
billion and you know trillion gazillion

468
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,799
million dollar market

469
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,399
you know it's still yet to come to that

470
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,799
so

471
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,320
another big challenge that i see is that

472
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,159
people did not really understand how

473
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
much time it takes from the time that

474
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,240
you you know you you get your license or

475
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
even before that till the time you're

476
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,320
able to have product to market so

477
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,399
there's been companies that two years

478
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,800
ago three years ago started to

479
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,879
you know to incorporate and apply for

480
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,119
the licenses and we're going to start to

481
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,318
see the fruits of those

482
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,159
you know

483
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,038
those tries

484
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,360
now three years later so we have a

485
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,558
specific market now that is growing at a

486
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,479
certain pace

487
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,759
and yes you know i will agree with steve

488
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,120
that more product is going to be coming

489
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,679
into market so now we're going to start

490
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,479
to see a competition in you know in the

491
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,480
product it's not about just having eugmp

492
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,960
flower it's going to be okay

493
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,960
patients and you know the the the people

494
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,798
in germany are going to have a selection

495
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,880
so we're gonna start to see product

496
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,960
differentiation we're gonna start to see

497
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
um certain products to be preferred over

498
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,679
others

499
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,199
and at the same time as more product is

500
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,960
coming to the market it's gonna be a you

501
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,919
know a price war so

502
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,360
those companies that are able to uh to

503
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,679
cultivate at lower cost we're going to

504
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,319
have a greater profit a greater margin

505
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,080
to reduce their prices so

506
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,839
we're starting to see a shift in the um

507
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,678
the criteria that people are you know

508
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,240
selecting their products now at the same

509
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,240
time when it comes down to greece

510
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
there's probably going to be not you

511
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,279
know most likely we're going to see at

512
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,798
least one company rolling out product

513
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:13,200
within 2022 i should say

514
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,400
companies

515
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
local partners with israeli expertise

516
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,679
and

517
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,960
everybody's paying close attention to

518
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,720
them to see how they're going to be able

519
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,079
to navigate the local uh you know

520
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
regulatory authorities in terms of

521
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,399
registering their parties and exporting

522
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,240
it to germany and other jurisdictions so

523
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,840
i think as far as greece goes within the

524
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,079
next six to eight months we're going to

525
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,399
come to see exactly how the system will

526
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,759
work right now we're there's a lot of

527
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,919
ambiguity

528
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,599
and there's people that still see a lot

529
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,759
of challenges but that's going to clear

530
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,199
up within the next few months

531
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,200
that's okay so i'm going to actually

532
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,279
skip down to the end here with with with

533
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,279
paul and and boniface because i think

534
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,759
that the certainly greece most people

535
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,000
are looking at european export but

536
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,558
within africa there's like an africa to

537
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,160
africa trade and then yeah i think also

538
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,678
paulieth can talk about maybe not just

539
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,558
coming to europe but maybe looking at

540
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
other markets like israel

541
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,960
right

542
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,080
within africa we have not

543
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,640
developed a domestic market i could tell

544
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,918
you for example in south africa

545
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,160
you can cultivate but you cannot extract

546
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,320
so you cultivate

547
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,600
you send it out then you import your

548
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,079
stuff back in

549
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,439
how ridiculous is that that's very very

550
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,279
ridiculous such inconsistency in

551
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,759
regulation

552
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,678
is what keeps investors away

553
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,919
but in zimbabwe

554
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,880
we understand the power of political

555
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,440
will

556
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,400
so cannabis is right at the president's

557
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,919
desk

558
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,640
the president

559
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,720
himself is in charge of cannabis

560
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,320
i'll give you something here

561
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,360
we've got a five-year tax holiday for

562
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,558
anyone who will come and farm cannabis

563
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,719
day

564
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,918
five years you don't pay tax

565
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,200
you want to bring your money back to

566
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
germany you want to bring it back to

567
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
america you can

568
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,359
expatuate all your profits

569
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,759
bring them back

570
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,599
um i'm sure by now you can tell that i'm

571
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,798
fighting for zimbabwe

572
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:17,599
uh unashamedly because you guys are all

573
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:21,839
here for your own agenda my agenda is

574
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:24,240
cannabis and zimbabwe and

575
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,119
i i would like you to know that we are

576
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,319
open for business for cannabis we want

577
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,519
zimbabwe to be like how brazil is for

578
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,558
sugarcane

579
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,839
we want that silicon valley type of

580
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:40,079
recognition for cannabis in zimbabwe we

581
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,079
want to raise the floor

582
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,038
for our standard of living we come here

583
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:48,079
to europe you guys live so well you have

584
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,240
electricity your trains run on time

585
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:54,079
guess what cannabis has got the

586
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,720
potential to unleash a good sustainable

587
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,480
industry for my people so that our floor

588
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
is a little bit higher

589
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,400
we don't want to be in the bush

590
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,600
but

591
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
i'm sorry to interrupt the commercial

592
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,359
here but i mean are you looking at are

593
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,000
you for example are people in zimbabwe

594
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,918
more looking at an inter african trade

595
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,839
or are they looking more at europe or

596
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,600
well first first and foremost we're

597
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,839
going to look to export everything we

598
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,240
make in africa

599
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,359
in agriculture especially is for export

600
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,359
purposes

601
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,279
you have made it such that we rely on

602
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,599
your foreign currency so we cannot live

603
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,519
if we don't sell you this cannabis we

604
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,119
want to sell it to you first

605
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,440
and then after that

606
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,839
maybe we can educate our people

607
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,080
on how to use this lovely plant because

608
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,038
we were using it for thousands of years

609
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,199
until uh some propaganda came

610
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,879
and we stopped so

611
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,200
so so clearly though i mean there is

612
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
already african cannabis going to israel

613
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,679
so maybe paul you can talk a little bit

614
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,759
are you from the new zealand perspective

615
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,480
how do you see your emerging market

616
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,200
developing with sort of a diverse

617
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,798
uh export ideal not just coming to

618
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,919
europe but also going to other markets

619
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,440
like israel

620
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,440
of course those regulations that were

621
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
passed last year they aimed at the new

622
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
zealand market just um

623
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,678
decreasing the dependency on those

624
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,678
exports as steven said i mean and this

625
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,759
is the this is the main goal that new

626
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,960
zealand currently had since they were so

627
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,558
dependent and they had those super high

628
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
regulations which of course are now

629
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,759
helpful if you're looking to export

630
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,359
because new zealand has already some of

631
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,359
the highest regulations in the world

632
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,918
which will allow us to export but of

633
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,000
course this came into place to decrease

634
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,320
dependency and

635
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,400
given all given the number of companies

636
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,240
in new zealand and the really i mean if

637
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,000
you know new zealand it's a very it's a

638
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,759
beautiful country but of course it is a

639
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,599
very small market and we're not just

640
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,679
talking about cannabis market we're

641
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,439
talking in general for any product that

642
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
a new zealand company makes a lot of new

643
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,080
zealand companies are looking to export

644
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
like

645
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,199
they're basically basically important

646
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,719
global no matter what they do those

647
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,120
really high standards allow the new

648
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,960
zealand companies to then export to

649
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,599
germany so this is currently i would say

650
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,279
the highest priority for new zealand

651
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,158
companies but of course there are

652
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,319
they're also looking to to australia and

653
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,960
of course israel would also be in those

654
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,399
top three markets to to look at foreign

655
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,000
companies well i think i think what

656
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
everybody is is kind of getting a sense

657
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,279
of if they didn't have already is you

658
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,119
know going country to country with

659
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,960
cannabis is a bit of a risky proposition

660
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,479
to begin with so i'm going to throw this

661
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,759
out to all of you what would you say are

662
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,480
some of the best

663
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,158
risk mitigation techniques um that

664
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,079
companies can start to think about it

665
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,799
could be hiring local it could be

666
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,639
looking at say reaching an eu gmt

667
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,720
standard what are the kinds of things

668
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,240
that you're seeing in your own markets

669
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,038
that are helping cultivators and

670
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,960
producers meet the challenge of

671
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,879
basically being a developing market and

672
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,000
then exporting to another developing

673
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
market

674
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,880
um oh i'll take a step

675
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,959
i i think that the days of

676
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,080
the investment decks where companies

677
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,480
have flags planted all around the world

678
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,158
uh are kind of outnumbered thankfully

679
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,880
and that's really as a result of the

680
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,880
realization of just how difficult uh

681
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,480
executing international growth and

682
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,640
international business development can

683
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,519
be um one of um you know we have worked

684
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,600
in probably around 40 odd countries

685
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,000
over the last of the last five years and

686
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,399
really on when we work with clients one

687
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,159
of the key things is on local

688
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,080
partnership and that is you know local

689
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,400
expertise who understand not only the

690
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,038
legal system and have legal partners but

691
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,640
also you know can develop the

692
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,798
commercial interests

693
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,880
when you know when um

694
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,558
you or they are not there to take care

695
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,559
of us and that could be everybody from

696
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,158
you know in for instance in germany it

697
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,918
could be anybody from a distribution

698
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,159
partner all the way through to um

699
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,600
medical and science and it's it's it's

700
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,960
that type of

701
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:53,119
um it's that type of partnership that is

702
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,600
critical for any business that wants to

703
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,519
flourish trying to come in and employ a

704
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,359
brand manager or a country manager and

705
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,558
have them execute

706
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,038
organically is exceptionally difficult

707
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:07,200
exceptionally exceptionally difficult um

708
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,960
because i suppose what you're missing

709
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,600
out on is is the years of experience and

710
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,120
in such an early at such an early stage

711
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,519
of the industry

712
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,639
there is it is a race you know it is a

713
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,639
land grab

714
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,038
to to to acquire market share or

715
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,799
certainly first to market in a certain

716
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,558
in a certain sense and

717
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,278
kind of market ownership and that is you

718
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,678
know from patient access that is from

719
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,240
owning areas of the supply chain because

720
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,798
if you can own them and lock them down

721
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,679
it is very hard to disrupt them in a in

722
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,759
this period of time so having local

723
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,360
partners i think has been exceptionally

724
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,798
helpful for

725
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,000
you see some of the companies and

726
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:45,839
certainly some of the clever companies

727
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,480
who've made quite strong strategic

728
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,639
acquisitions now i think there is

729
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,440
you know there is a little froth in the

730
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,120
market but nowhere near what you see in

731
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,519
in north america now

732
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:01,038
i think we you know the last icbc was

733
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,960
here in berlin in 2019 and there is

734
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,599
there's probably a kind of a

735
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,000
a cap on company valuation european

736
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,399
company valuations probably in the let's

737
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,558
say 30 to 40 million was probably where

738
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,159
the the top european company was now

739
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,639
fast forward around a year and a half

740
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,559
and you're around 200 250.

741
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,360
it's a that's a

742
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,440
phenomenal growth for for for for strong

743
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,199
european assets but it's pennies on the

744
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,440
dollar when you realize just how big

745
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
this market can be and the potential

746
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,360
size of these companies in comparison to

747
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,960
what we're seeing in north america

748
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,719
i think that was a very very thank you

749
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
for that that very comprehensive

750
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,079
response so i'm going to actually throw

751
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,519
this out to everybody else can you tell

752
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,079
the audience or entertain them maybe

753
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,400
with any uh either success or horror

754
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:47,119
stories that you might have come across

755
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,278
about companies that you know sally

756
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,599
forth and either get into trouble or

757
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,599
have managed to overcome some of the

758
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,678
challenges that i think everybody is

759
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,678
talking about and referencing

760
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,080
i mean talking about success i'm really

761
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,440
happy that we now have two of those new

762
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,439
zealand companies i'm working with and

763
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
supporting in the market they have

764
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,880
agreements in place with german

765
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,000
wholesalers and importers which was of

766
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,679
course a really big step for them so i'm

767
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,359
excited so i would definitely count this

768
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,120
as a really great success story for new

769
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,879
zealand and for the local industry and

770
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,119
of course there's way more company that

771
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,520
now take this as inspiration to also

772
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,119
look for partners here in the market and

773
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,240
additionally i think

774
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,959
in general if you're looking at the

775
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,960
industry it is it is a success story for

776
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,159
the country because if you're looking at

777
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,798
new zealand

778
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,039
a lot of the land is owned by the maori

779
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,038
population and so new zealand puts a lot

780
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,960
of resources and support in that to

781
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,359
support the local industry that is that

782
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
is partly run by maoris

783
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,398
and the great thing is we already heard

784
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,759
that yesterday in jamie's keynote i

785
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,239
believe that she said

786
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,679
we're moving away from money i mean yes

787
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,880
money is still very important but we're

788
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,880
looking for well being for

789
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,720
sustainability and so on and i think

790
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,120
really this is where new zealand has

791
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,038
done a really big step because if you're

792
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,278
looking at those maori businesses that

793
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,038
that grow the cannabis there they really

794
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,480
put the money into into the local

795
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:08,319
community and really help the region the

796
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,159
rural areas grow well i think that paul

797
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,519
you're bringing up a big point that we

798
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,080
were all discussing in the back room

799
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,679
which is you know cannabis as a tool of

800
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,839
economic development

801
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,240
maybe costas and boniface you can talk a

802
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:23,038
little bit about you know the emerging

803
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,038
economic and incentive environment

804
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,960
that is allowing the industry to grow

805
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,919
when we start with costa

806
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,360
sure i think that most of the

807
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,200
european countries they're already

808
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,839
offering european

809
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
grants incentives that are

810
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,439
in most cases i know for a fact it works

811
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,719
for portugal it works for greece i'm not

812
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,038
familiar with any other country but i'm

813
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,399
sure it's the same mechanism that

814
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,519
gets implemented

815
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,439
they're able to provide grants with uh

816
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,000
specific percentages up to

817
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,679
uh like 30 40 of

818
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,798
construction cost or you know greenhouse

819
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,320
construction depending on how far like

820
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,240
you get more money the further out you

821
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,319
are from major cities

822
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,558
so that that is a great financial

823
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,398
incentive uh you know where you're

824
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,480
looking at putting together like a 10

825
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,079
million year facility you could get a

826
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,798
you know a couple million two three

827
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,519
million uh based on the location however

828
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,519
that that creates another potential

829
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,839
challenge which is okay if you're going

830
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,200
to go in a remote village in greece that

831
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,558
you know nobody really wants to go and

832
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,679
live there or you're going to find your

833
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,759
workforce so

834
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,360
although the father you know

835
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,879
and i'm going to go back to a little bit

836
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,719
to uh the risk mitigation question that

837
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,039
you said and i think that one of the

838
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,798
most important uh aspects a lot of

839
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,119
people miss in the industry is that you

840
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,639
know you need to you need to educate

841
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,678
yourself about the industry you need to

842
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,399
learn and make sure that you have clear

843
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,720
and

844
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,158
real expectations as to where the

845
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,360
industry is right now where it's going

846
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,960
to go because

847
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,398
right now

848
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,159
you're looking to

849
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,798
put a facility together that's going to

850
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,278
have product ready probably in about two

851
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,720
and a half to three years from now so

852
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,798
how are you setting those expectations

853
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,558
you know and you know looking at those

854
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,480
uh strong partners i mean i work for a

855
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,599
company that we manufacture eugmp

856
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,200
equipment

857
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,879
and

858
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
i have people all over the world

859
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,840
reaching out to us and like well you

860
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,599
know we want to get into extraction they

861
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,319
want to buy equipment and

862
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,639
talking about those horror stories i i

863
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,678
come across at least three different

864
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,399
companies that had already paid

865
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,240
you know

866
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,398
three four hundred thousand

867
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,038
euros worth of equipment that didn't

868
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,798
have a ce marking and could not cross

869
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,440
the border and get into border and get

870
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,158
into europe so

871
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,919
and it's funny because the people that

872
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,600
actually ordered that equipment were

873
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,080
based in either canada or the united

874
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,480
states so it wasn't people that are

875
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,759
outside of the industry they knew what's

876
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,919
being used

877
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,879
but they seemed to have missed this

878
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,399
little piece of information uh eugmp has

879
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,760
been another uh big challenge for many

880
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:57,759
it used to be a challenge up until a

881
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,240
couple of years ago until we came to see

882
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,519
how companies came to overcome that

883
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,038
and

884
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,839
i think that

885
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,240
a common practice in europe has been

886
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,278
to bring people in from the pharma

887
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,960
industry

888
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,200
work closely with them

889
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,159
and there has been a lot of people that

890
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,919
were you know promising eu gmp yeah we

891
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,640
know it we can do it et cetera et cetera

892
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,080
but

893
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640
the only people that were actually to

894
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,480
pull it off were people that

895
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,399
brought the people in worked with them

896
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,839
and actually kept that

897
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,759
you know that knowledge in-house

898
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:33,678
developed it and they kept it kind of

899
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,679
you know secret so to me uh in terms of

900
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,399
mitigating that risk is

901
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,720
work with people that have proven

902
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,398
results as well as passion right i mean

903
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,079
vanase was talking about this is one of

904
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,479
the greatest things about working in an

905
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,879
emerging market there's there's

906
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,960
youth there's there's activism there's

907
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,640
passion what would you say that's that

908
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,038
the role of that and the importance of

909
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,519
that is in developing markets like

910
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,919
zimbabwe for example uh i think it's

911
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,919
it's very important uh where we are

912
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,120
today is probably where the rest of the

913
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,919
world was five years ago

914
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,038
we have a lot of optimism when i came to

915
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,840
berlin

916
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,759
i thought i was going to be the next cbd

917
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,359
smokable flower king

918
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,679
but after one day

919
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,678
i grew from this big and i feel this

920
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,000
small right now

921
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,480
but it's good because everyone here that

922
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,839
i've had a chance to interact with has

923
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,919
taken the time

924
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,558
to teach me what's going on in the

925
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,000
industry to allow my expectations to be

926
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,480
more realistic

927
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,679
i not only represent myself i represent

928
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,000
a nation

929
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,798
and the hopes of a nation lie with

930
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,839
cannabis the vice president came on tv

931
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,759
the other day said we have 1.5 billion

932
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,038
dollars of cannabis that we're gonna

933
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,359
sell this year

934
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,398
we haven't even sold two million dollars

935
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:55,119
you understand so that optimism uh i'm

936
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:58,398
sure everyone here has had it before

937
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:00,158
with cannabis it's a new industry

938
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,359
it just needs to be checked we need to

939
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,320
be practical about what to expect and

940
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,038
when to expect it and how to expect it

941
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,519
but

942
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,240
to speak a little bit further

943
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,798
on the opportunities that exist i think

944
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,558
before we address the opportunities we

945
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,440
need to look at education and regulation

946
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:21,759
people

947
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,519
in my country need to be educated on

948
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,000
this it's not the same as europe and

949
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,919
north america there's a huge stigma

950
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
uh we need to educate our doctors our

951
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,720
pharmacists we need to create a local

952
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,319
market sounds like germany yeah we need

953
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,159
to make sure that

954
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,480
uh before

955
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,360
we even start talking about the bigger

956
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,159
things

957
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,199
the the basic foundation to allow there

958
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,399
to be

959
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,640
a cannabis national master plan so to

960
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,038
say we're trying to make a national

961
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,519
master plan where we're putting cannabis

962
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,319
in our curriculum to get kids learning

963
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,359
about this plant because we understand

964
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:02,398
the value that this plant has

965
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,158
and we want to unleash its potential in

966
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,599
zimbabwe

967
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,200
so i'm actually going to come back to

968
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,199
paul here for a question

969
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,720
how important is it

970
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,638
to network

971
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,638
ahead of time and know that not only

972
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,000
you're going a crop in your own country

973
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,480
but figuring out

974
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,679
where you have to go right and where you

975
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,559
want to target why is it so important to

976
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,918
find international partners in that

977
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,358
process

978
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,319
uh i think very touching on there is

979
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,078
kind of like going back to the

980
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,039
mitigation risk because i think it's

981
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,399
it's really crucial to have this partner

982
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,239
who understands

983
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,638
um the local market and this is why

984
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,239
networking is is more than important

985
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,679
than ever even though

986
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,078
um if you're looking at the new zealand

987
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,720
companies they're all like they haven't

988
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,159
exported really like a big quantity yet

989
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,398
we're still in an early stage and all

990
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,398
they have shipped is samples so far

991
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,719
but it's really good for also the

992
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,719
economic stability of those companies to

993
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,879
already have supply agreements in place

994
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,879
which they have domestically but also

995
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,680
internationally and this is why

996
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,200
networking is very very important

997
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,039
steve i'm actually going to come back to

998
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,118
you for a second because the uk actually

999
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,559
is a very very interesting case i think

1000
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,880
it was a couple of years ago still that

1001
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,440
the uk was the major that's the biggest

1002
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,920
export country for cannabis in the world

1003
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,880
not canada or anything else um what does

1004
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,200
that kind of dynamic create domestically

1005
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,119
what is the tension there

1006
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:31,039
uh it's i suppose it's it's quite um

1007
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,440
elite and and controlled um the uk

1008
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,079
has been producing cannabis

1009
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,760
near near about 20 years

1010
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,720
and um what you have had is you have had

1011
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,280
this cut off from actual patients while

1012
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,480
it's gone through i suppose a a pharma a

1013
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,359
farmer root

1014
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,679
so there's been i suppose

1015
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,838
within within the the cannabis industry

1016
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,559
and certainly within the the patient

1017
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,480
community there's been a lot of friction

1018
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,719
between um the

1019
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,079
the types of groups who have gone down

1020
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,519
the farmer route and you know it's

1021
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,280
understandable going down the farm route

1022
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,480
it does take significant time investment

1023
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,119
and you do want to protect that

1024
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,679
investment as much as you can but it it

1025
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,960
there's a contrast in so far as well um

1026
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,279
if you look at

1027
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,199
the basics of us in in the early stage

1028
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,519
of cultivation there is a product there

1029
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,000
ready for ready for patients to to to

1030
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,199
use and consume and there is i suppose

1031
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,440
friction that

1032
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,039
the decision hasn't been made to allow

1033
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
that access early days now that has been

1034
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,358
rectified and patients are getting

1035
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:34,319
access under you know under under a very

1036
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,199
still strict uh manner and protocol

1037
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,119
but

1038
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:42,399
you definitely have um tension in so far

1039
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,880
as why you know why is this elite group

1040
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,559
allowed access and it is cut off you

1041
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,838
know and why is the government not

1042
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,440
engaging and

1043
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,799
on this dialogue and a lot of that is

1044
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,960
obviously down to

1045
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,960
um cannabis has to be the most

1046
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,199
politically friendly conversation of the

1047
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,559
last 20 years now thankfully i think

1048
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,118
every single

1049
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,519
every single country is adapting their

1050
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,280
tone and openness and transparency

1051
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,880
around discussing cannabis now there's

1052
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,640
the broader education that this isn't

1053
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,640
something that kills and this isn't uh

1054
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,960
reefer madness so i think we've seen

1055
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,719
sweeping changes across uh across the

1056
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,880
globe that cannabis is no longer the

1057
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,959
political hot potato that they used to

1058
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,079
be and you know

1059
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,720
a kind of

1060
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,400
a politician can come to a cannabis

1061
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,279
conference free from the stigma where

1062
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,519
you know uh most of us uh where we're

1063
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,839
we're sharp suits and uh you know we we

1064
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,679
where we speak in a very professional

1065
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,239
manner and that's you know that's

1066
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,399
relatively new this this this b2b side

1067
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,439
where we talk of we talk of

1068
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,240
implementation of a proper um a proper

1069
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,559
commercial and responsible industry

1070
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:49,279
and i think you know it's the industry's

1071
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,838
just it's it's been hampered if you will

1072
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,760
by a lack of collective

1073
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,679
collective individuals who are informed

1074
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,680
on the topic you know i think when we

1075
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,919
started prohibition partners a couple of

1076
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,679
years ago like i i wanted to actually

1077
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,119
invest in in the space invest in

1078
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,639
european opportunities but there was

1079
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,240
very little information out there as to

1080
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,159
what was happening

1081
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,319
and you know and i think events like

1082
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,799
these are absolutely critical for us to

1083
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,280
come and share ideas now we may disagree

1084
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,800
or you know we may think that there is

1085
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,560
certain better ways to do it but that is

1086
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,000
all part of the process and certainly

1087
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,279
something that you know should be should

1088
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,719
be welcomed

1089
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,560
okay so i've got another i've got

1090
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,838
another question and i'd like this to be

1091
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,960
around robin

1092
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,759
what is your favorite developing market

1093
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,679
that's not yours and why start with

1094
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
costas

1095
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,879
well you know have to love germany of

1096
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,000
course because it's by far the

1097
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,720
well you know

1098
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,880
and to be more specific on the patient

1099
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,559
access only uh

1100
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,960
it is really surprising how germany a

1101
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,039
country that always focuses on exports

1102
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,720
you know has only granted three licenses

1103
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,679
i i have a feeling that this might

1104
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,519
change uh pretty soon just based on you

1105
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,559
know previous track record

1106
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:03,280
but uh we'll get to see that however

1107
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,960
i mean malta has been doing a great uh

1108
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,800
job you know

1109
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,880
both

1110
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,560
government-led and you know

1111
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
multi-enterprise has been doing a great

1112
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,799
job promoting the opportunities in the

1113
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,079
country and i think that there's

1114
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,440
there's been

1115
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,440
although a small country but they have

1116
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,559
created a really interesting uh scheme

1117
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,559
of how they can work as a hub

1118
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,559
although not a

1119
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,239
european union country but within the

1120
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,400
european continent i think that north

1121
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,358
macedonia has a lot of potential

1122
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,880
um

1123
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:35,440
why do you think that north macedonia

1124
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
has such so much potential well there's

1125
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,200
you know the if i were to compare it i

1126
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,960
mean there's pretty similar climate you

1127
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,960
know with greece and portugal so uh

1128
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,119
when we when we say when we speak about

1129
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,199
climate it's not only i mean when you're

1130
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,480
you know cultivating in an eu gmp uh or

1131
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,919
jcp

1132
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,320
environment i think that the climate

1133
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,000
does play in you know a certain role but

1134
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,800
not that big of a it doesn't really make

1135
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,639
that big of a difference however

1136
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,680
it is uh it is a you know low

1137
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,039
electricity you know low labor uh costs

1138
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,719
um

1139
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,920
if you're able to overcome a ugp and i

1140
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,639
think that they have a government that's

1141
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,720
really supportive of the industry

1142
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,000
from what i spoke with a few people over

1143
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,759
the last few days there you know we

1144
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,599
should be expecting some changes in that

1145
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,079
part of the world as well

1146
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,838
uh i mean portugal has been i think the

1147
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,519
leading uh country in terms of you know

1148
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,838
cultivation and

1149
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,759
2022 is going to we're really going to

1150
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,440
see a lot of cultivation a lot of flower

1151
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,910
coming out of portugal

1152
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,200
um

1153
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,639
[Music]

1154
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,960
but yeah i think that you know i mean

1155
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,960
denmark of course is you know is a more

1156
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,720
established market in the sense that you

1157
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,519
know exactly what's going on a lot of

1158
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,279
transparency and uh we've been you know

1159
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,960
as vitalists we've you know already

1160
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,359
deployed equipment there and there's

1161
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,199
been companies that are really producing

1162
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,239
you know

1163
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,679
pharmaceutical grade extracts let's say

1164
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,679
so

1165
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,039
i really like countries that there is

1166
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,879
stability but at the same time those

1167
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,199
countries with great potential

1168
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,200
there's the risk might seem to be there

1169
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,199
at the moment but i think that

1170
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,480
if you're working with people that you

1171
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,000
know

1172
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,240
local people that have been in the

1173
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,039
industry you can kind of safeguard uh

1174
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,719
your investment

1175
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,719
but yeah you know those are the

1176
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,399
countries that beyond here what about

1177
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,679
what about down down towards

1178
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,000
non-european countries within africa or

1179
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,279
thailand or you know further afield

1180
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,800
china

1181
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,480
i wanted to go with germany as my

1182
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,000
favorite emerging market besides new

1183
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,519
zealand but since kostas claimed that i

1184
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,039
would go with israel

1185
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,280
because i think there's also definitely

1186
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,358
still a lot of potential for companies

1187
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,200
exporting there because as i understand

1188
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,880
there's a domestic there's a domestic

1189
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,519
production but of course there's still

1190
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,079
some room for some high quality products

1191
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:49,119
there um and of course there is this

1192
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,519
this taste in in israel that or this

1193
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,920
this preference for for for flower

1194
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,960
rather than uh just uh processed

1195
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,079
products so i think this would

1196
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,599
definitely be

1197
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,960
very interesting but you just mentioned

1198
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,480
thailand i mean i don't know the details

1199
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,720
but i know that some of the new zealand

1200
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
companies are also kind of looking into

1201
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,598
thailand and the current developments

1202
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,599
there i've actually got a question for

1203
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,920
boniface i mean for example morocco has

1204
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,838
got changing you know legalization laws

1205
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,000
etc and cultivation

1206
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,679
from your perspective just within africa

1207
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,480
where would you say or like the hot

1208
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:21,679
countries besides south africa and and

1209
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,000
um besides south africa and zimbabwe i

1210
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,480
was actually surprised that the lady

1211
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,838
from new frontier data didn't mention

1212
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,079
lesotho that sotu is producing and

1213
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,078
exporting more than zimbabwe and south

1214
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,359
africa put together

1215
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,400
do you know what we call the tsutube

1216
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,279
back home

1217
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,960
we call it the kingdom of mischief

1218
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
yeah they just

1219
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,280
legalized psilocybin

1220
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,759
they're legalizing anything and

1221
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,640
everything in lesotho so i'm excited

1222
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,920
about lesotho check it out too

1223
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,679
okay so i'm going to throw this out does

1224
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,838
anybody have any questions for the

1225
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:59,358
panelists here would you like to ask

1226
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,960
about any regions no i got more

1227
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,279
none

1228
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,880
okay i have a question okay

1229
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,800
is it all going to be just commodities

1230
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,119
is that the future

1231
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,280
right because i feel like

1232
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,838
cannabis in this global marketplace is

1233
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,680
moving really more toward a cigarette

1234
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:18,719
style of production as opposed to say a

1235
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,559
wine or a beer style

1236
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,039
right and it seems like everybody's

1237
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,400
looking for that for like giant mega

1238
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,239
farms and

1239
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,318
huge amounts of exporting but where's

1240
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,519
the craft is there space for that in any

1241
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,920
of these countries in any of these

1242
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,199
spaces

1243
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,280
yeah there's definitely room for that in

1244
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,559
new zealand because if you

1245
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,560
a lot of the companies there are

1246
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,759
actually really really small so with all

1247
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:44,000
these cultivators and producers of then

1248
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,760
uh products from the cannabis it's

1249
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,599
really we're not talking high volume

1250
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,680
it's going to be very specialized and a

1251
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,680
lot of us come a lot of the companies in

1252
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,358
new zealand that actually the people

1253
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,118
behind it they all have a very strong

1254
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,039
pharmaceutical background so they're

1255
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,920
actually looking to not just export

1256
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:01,440
flour but moving into into a value-add

1257
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,039
product so we're talking about extracts

1258
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,880
and other things and because this also

1259
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,519
let's say kind of kind of

1260
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,200
from my perspective saves your business

1261
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,559
um in in the medical space if we're

1262
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,318
talking about legalization in other

1263
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,759
countries because then you have this

1264
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,239
this extract

1265
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,760
this liquid and because you know that

1266
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,679
a lot of the patients or some of the

1267
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,560
patients they would not necessarily like

1268
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,679
to smoke or vaporize it so this is why

1269
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,960
actually new zealand companies

1270
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,159
definitely focus on the value-add

1271
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,559
products and in the long run and not

1272
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,559
just exporting flowers and mass but just

1273
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,440
like small quantities right now but high

1274
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,358
quality

1275
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,760
see i was actually hoping you might talk

1276
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:40,078
a little bit about the cbd craft

1277
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,240
industry in in the uk a little bit or is

1278
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,200
there one yeah

1279
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,519
craft is a is an odd term when when you

1280
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:51,039
put it to cannabis because ultimately

1281
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:53,199
what it just means is uh consistency and

1282
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,440
what's what we what we what we continue

1283
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,679
to lack in this industry is consistency

1284
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,079
so the small batch producers who have

1285
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,118
been provided who who've

1286
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,760
i suppose

1287
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,480
who have been able to produce

1288
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,400
consistency are now termed craft and

1289
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,519
there is a nice premium and sound about

1290
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,720
that but

1291
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:15,679
i think in the stage of of the industry

1292
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,719
the level of craft is still a little bit

1293
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,719
far out i am you know you have consumers

1294
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,279
who are only just starting to understand

1295
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,358
what they want and what they like and

1296
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,800
the volume of and and i suppose

1297
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:31,279
frequency of products in the market is

1298
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,920
is still quite minimal especially in

1299
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,720
europe in terms of what choice you have

1300
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,358
and and product availability you know uh

1301
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,719
cbd craft markets uh

1302
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,199
uh you know i

1303
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:46,159
look rightly or wrongly i'm i'm

1304
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,759
i i i'm quite skeptical of of the cbd of

1305
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,399
the cbd market

1306
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,240
i think you know you have a number a

1307
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,200
large number of players who are

1308
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,639
promoting these cbd craft brands that if

1309
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,838
you look at the production chain they

1310
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:01,759
all come from the exact same contract

1311
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:03,440
manufacturer and you know you you you

1312
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,440
you have this right across europe and

1313
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,318
these are fooling the consumers and you

1314
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,519
know it is not building any sort of

1315
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:14,000
uh true education and true brand

1316
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,440
credibility uh with either the product

1317
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,960
icbd or the the brand itself and that

1318
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,838
obviously comes from early stage

1319
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,358
industry and misconception on both sides

1320
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:24,318
of the field but

1321
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:26,799
the

1322
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,800
you you will of course have consumers

1323
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,640
who want differentiation who want

1324
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,839
personalization and and different

1325
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:36,719
experiences you are seeing um

1326
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:40,078
brand masters from you know from pharma

1327
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:42,879
from food and drink from retail move

1328
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:46,560
into the cannabis sector and there are

1329
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,119
uh spicy looking cbd brands and products

1330
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,279
out there all from cosmetics to beauty

1331
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,240
to health and wellness and food and

1332
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,200
drink starting to emerge now

1333
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,919
whether

1334
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:00,719
there is a big enough cbd market uh in

1335
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,079
the uk under uh under the existing

1336
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:06,480
regulations to maintain that is still up

1337
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,160
for up for debate but you know they're

1338
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,318
all hoping you they're they're seeing

1339
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,960
what has happened in in north american

1340
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,960
market where there is a thc opportunity

1341
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,240
and you know that transition to chc and

1342
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,079
consumer demand for those type of

1343
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:21,039
product variations is obviously off the

1344
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:24,240
charts so uh it's it's it's an exciting

1345
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,318
testing stage but it comes with a huge

1346
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,239
and huge huge amount of risk

1347
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,400
customers you want to add to them yeah i

1348
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,399
just want to uh you know will this

1349
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,639
that was a great question and uh i must

1350
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,160
say that for the longest time that i i

1351
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:37,920
always thought of i mean we're an

1352
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,519
extraction man you know equipment

1353
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,838
manufacturing company

1354
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,358
um so i'm very less familiar with

1355
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,519
cultivation however it's something that

1356
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,960
i'm i really enjoy talking about and

1357
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,920
listening it's about and

1358
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,199
um i want to thank tyler yesterday we we

1359
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,119
had a great discussion from valeos and

1360
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,960
the craft industry you know he made a

1361
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,480
really nice comment that the size of the

1362
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,800
craft industry you know is between you

1363
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,800
know three to ten metric tons production

1364
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,720
of you know per year i think that this

1365
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,119
is what we're seeing in europe so

1366
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:10,558
i i thought it was going to be much less

1367
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,640
but i think that you know this is

1368
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,200
substantial uh i mean

1369
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:17,920
it fits perfectly the

1370
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,519
european cultivation model of the

1371
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,119
facilities that we're seeing being built

1372
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,800
now and

1373
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,880
for the longest time i thought that yes

1374
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,240
of course you know cannabis similar to

1375
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,200
tomatoes or whatever there's going to be

1376
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:31,679
commoditization and

1377
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,519
i don't think that is true

1378
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,199
i think that the cannabis consumer and

1379
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,039
you know let's let's call the spatial

1380
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,078
spade i mean it to me it does not really

1381
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,000
define

1382
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,318
where this uh

1383
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,880
adult use and where does medical use in

1384
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,960
terms of you know specifically for flour

1385
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,559
where you know how many people are you

1386
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,039
know purchasing cannabis in germany for

1387
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,160
medical use and how many for adult use

1388
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,920
now i know that there is a lot of uh

1389
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,118
overlap but

1390
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,920
you know we're starting to see over the

1391
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,720
last year at least that even the demand

1392
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,720
in germany is increasing primarily for

1393
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,558
you know people that are uh paying for

1394
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,959
cannabis privately

1395
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,800
so i think that over the next year year

1396
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,960
and a half we're gonna start to see a

1397
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,760
significant increase in the quantity

1398
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,440
that's been

1399
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,160
in the market in germany

1400
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,440
for people that are you know using both

1401
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:27,759
uh you know for for both usages so

1402
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,200
always assimilate the cannabis consumer

1403
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,920
as like you know the coffee consumer or

1404
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,439
the wine consumer and yes you can go to

1405
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,760
starbucks and get an espresso but i

1406
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,240
really like you know an espresso from a

1407
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,480
little you know italian coffee shop and

1408
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,879
you know or or somebody that's you know

1409
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,400
a colombian coffee shop so

1410
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,119
it doesn't mean that i won't buy coffee

1411
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,440
from starbucks but if i if i you know if

1412
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,240
i have access to that other product i

1413
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,639
would much rather enjoy that coffee so i

1414
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,479
think that this is

1415
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:59,279
it's harder a lot because starbucks can

1416
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,318
afford to have all the nice locations

1417
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,599
and so

1418
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,199
you know the little mom and pop they

1419
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,880
can't pay the rent on the gentrified

1420
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,598
neighborhood anymore and now where do

1421
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,559
you go to get your little fancy yeah but

1422
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,838
here we go

1423
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,280
the cannabis has been distributed

1424
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,119
through pharmacies so you know the same

1425
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,160
pharmacy could have the same products

1426
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,079
and you know

1427
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,598
this is where we're going to see the

1428
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,760
the product differentiation come into

1429
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,838
play really strongly so when you know

1430
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,839
when when when tyler is cultivating you

1431
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:24,960
know this uh uh

1432
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:26,400
you know this product that he's been

1433
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,318
cultivated in the united states for the

1434
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,960
last 10 years and you know it's right

1435
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:33,039
next to uh you know a large

1436
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,920
canadian company that you know has a

1437
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:35,199
like

1438
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,280
i'm not going to even get into the

1439
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,759
potencies but the real there is

1440
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,040
differences in the cannabis

1441
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,119
flowers so

1442
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,000
if i had to choose i would much rather

1443
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,838
go for a you know a a product that has

1444
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,159
come from the craft industry versus you

1445
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,358
know the big names let's say well that

1446
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,480
you actually raised an interesting

1447
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,159
question here because we're all talking

1448
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,159
about international exports but no one

1449
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,159
has really talked about developing

1450
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,838
countries exporting into the united

1451
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,519
states

1452
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:03,519
maybe i would start with boniface is

1453
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,838
that is that something that is on the

1454
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:08,639
drawing board in zimbabwe or throughout

1455
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,799
africa or is it just too difficult

1456
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,799
it's it's difficult because hemp is

1457
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,039
really cheap in the states i mean in

1458
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,440
california i got buddies who stopped

1459
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,960
growing hemp i'm convincing them to move

1460
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,079
to zimbabwe

1461
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,679
so

1462
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,119
that's that's difficult but

1463
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,159
going back to the previous question

1464
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,079
about the products um what i see the

1465
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,399
future of uh

1466
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,720
cannabis and cannabis products i think

1467
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,880
of uh if you go to a restaurant and you

1468
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:37,679
look at a table there's a salt and

1469
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,838
pepper the sugar well would like to have

1470
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:43,279
you know cannabis products right there

1471
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,799
just like salt and pepper and sugar

1472
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,319
are there any questions because we're

1473
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,359
sort of getting to the end of the panel

1474
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,358
no questions out there

1475
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,880
hi um nim from israel

1476
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,639
um everyone's speaking about cannabis as

1477
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,160
a commodity

1478
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,199
as a commodity

1479
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:15,838
and um in israel we're

1480
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:18,879
importing around like just our companies

1481
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,799
or importing 1.2 tons per year

1482
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,640
of medical cannabis and it's a

1483
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,880
connoisseur product

1484
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,960
like the market is looking for

1485
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,519
more um

1486
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,760
quality than quantity i mean they want

1487
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,440
quality and quantity now everyone here

1488
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,079
is speaking about cannabis as a

1489
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,639
commodity sugar

1490
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,800
tomatoes it's not i mean hemp is a

1491
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,480
commodity cbd

1492
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,640
is a commodity

1493
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,159
a cannabis in my eyes of course

1494
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:47,279
and in the israeli market they're

1495
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,838
looking for

1496
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,960
premium premium premium product

1497
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,279
and

1498
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,559
i i haven't heard anything about this

1499
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,240
the quality

1500
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,240
and the

1501
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,919
of these products and importing and

1502
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,879
exporting well i think you're asking

1503
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,920
about the eu gmp issue or or producing

1504
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,640
for gmp for export i think everyone go

1505
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,280
ahead once you go to um the regulations

1506
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:14,078
eugmp or control union

1507
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,319
um you lose a lot of the quality for

1508
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,839
because of the regulations

1509
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,599
that's what i've we've been seeing

1510
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,358
because everyone's

1511
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,559
growing their capacity if you have eugmp

1512
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:24,480
it costs you a lot of money so you have

1513
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,559
to have a lot of quantity

1514
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,039
to um

1515
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,920
let's say for to pay for that

1516
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:35,358
i can't see how um

1517
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,960
you can have an eu gmp or uh or for

1518
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:40,400
import and have also the the quality of

1519
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,318
t20

1520
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,559
and terpene profiles of like three and a

1521
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:46,239
half percent with these huge uh

1522
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,839
facilities

1523
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,919
well i think that what you're talking

1524
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:51,920
about actually is is the dichotomy

1525
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,039
between having a regulated certified

1526
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,800
market which is gmp standard versus the

1527
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,400
other stuff and i think certainly there

1528
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,960
was a little bit of disagreement up here

1529
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,559
that you can't have that in in a gmp

1530
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,400
environment would anybody like to tackle

1531
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,480
that one

1532
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,400
no i'm not a cultivation expert but but

1533
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,000
i i strongly uh suggest that you speak

1534
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,680
with some of the and if you don't know

1535
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,480
anybody i can introduce you to a couple

1536
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:14,558
uh

1537
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,240
but to you know dive deeper in that but

1538
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,640
from my understanding you're able to

1539
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:19,759
cultivate quality under eu gmp

1540
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,279
uh

1541
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,200
you know the trying process is where you

1542
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,400
might be losing some because

1543
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,239
is gacp

1544
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,079
so you know it shouldn't really affect

1545
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,519
the quality of the product you write

1546
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,880
about the incentive of certain

1547
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,559
cultivators to cultivate high thc potent

1548
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,160
plants because they can get more money

1549
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,480
for it because actually

1550
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,879
you know you're getting paid

1551
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,280
based on the thc potency and cbd potency

1552
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,920
versus the rest of the you know the

1553
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,440
flavonoids and the terpenoids so there

1554
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,760
is an incentive

1555
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,039
to get a higher price for other products

1556
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,640
but this is a decision that the

1557
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,079
cultivator should take when it comes

1558
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,598
down to okay do i go for a product

1559
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,920
that's 18

1560
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,680
ph. get a little bit less money for it

1561
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,760
but maybe get larger markets you know

1562
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:05,759
market share in the market

1563
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,520
so i'm not quite clear if i answered you

1564
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,599
i think we're out of time do we have

1565
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,599
time for one more question or we do not

1566
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,720
okay well thank you so much can we have

1567
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,200
a round of applause for our

1568
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,199
distinguished panelists

1569
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:25,440
you
