1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,599
wow what a day what a day

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,320
um you know had thought about

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,320
utilizing a lot of information up here

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,240
about being an investor in what we do

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,079
but you've heard a lot today and frankly

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,719
i learned a lot today because in

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,320
particular novel foods is a really

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,479
interesting topic that we're having to

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,518
discover what that really means here

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,439
uh throughout europe so anyways i wanted

11
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,399
to start by introducing myself my name

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,439
is matt nordgren founder ceo of arcadian

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
capital

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,399
um we're happy to be here because uh our

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
firm is moving into europe now we're

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,399
launching arcadian europe and borg we

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,799
couldn't be more excited about it our

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,520
investors really have encouraged us a

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,038
lot of support there

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
but the first thing i think we want to

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,280
do

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,039
um

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,439
talk about this industry this is an

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,359
industry where we create a safe space

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,679
for other people to thrive

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,920
no judgment wouldn't the world be a

27
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,600
perfect place actually if in fact we

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,519
didn't judge anybody for anything they

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
ever did

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,159
there might not need to be a room for an

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,719
apology even then because we're all

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,960
connected through a collective conscious

33
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,719
like this plant did you know back in the

34
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,959
time when the dinosaurs all were wiped

35
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,200
out from earth there was nothing left

36
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,438
everything survived through a fungal

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
network frankly through mycelium and

38
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,519
other plant matters and so if you really

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,079
think about it whether you believe in

40
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,759
god which i do or you believe in science

41
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,959
either way there's a collective

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,319
conscious so in this room no judgment

43
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,039
and this is a community that we're

44
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,519
excited to pour into frankly excited

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840
about the companies here man downstairs

46
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,679
a lot of cool companies particularly and

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,439

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,159
of a female leader in the space

50
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,639
there was one booth that was like a neon

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,320
i don't even know it was like a color

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,280
room or something felt like i was at a

53
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,879
spa

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280

and you know there is no competition in

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
this space it hasn't institutionalized

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,760

00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,439
about talking about us today you heard

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
from a lot of experts

173
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,879
but what we're going to tell you about

174
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,199
is what an investor is supposed to do

175
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,879
for an industry and as this one matures

176
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,560
what we're committed to doing here as

177
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,478
well

178
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
and so the reason i asked you to set

179
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,159
your intentions earlier is because do

180
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
you know why they call it a present the

181
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
present this moment mindfulness being

182
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,399
here

183
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,598
because it's a gift

184
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,359
[Music]

185
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,519
it's a gift it's the greatest present we

186
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,840
were ever given

187
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,680
whether you're a science person you have

188
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,279
two brains right one with which to think

189
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,038
critically and want to think creatively

190
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,359
and guess what you're designed to think

191
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,279
about both fifty percent quickly and

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,879
fifty percent creatively

193
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,878
there's balanced air your body it's

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,800
homeostasis that's why we're all in this

195
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
industry isn't it giada

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
we're here to bring

197
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,120
health and wellness to people

198
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
and so this is all about balance and we

199
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,478
wanted you to be balanced coming into

200
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
this to end your day we're gonna have a

201
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,800
little party after they say

202
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,560
um so hopefully uh you enjoy that and

203
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,160
some of our information

204
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,918
but now for some informative details

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,919
four things to pay attention to as an

206
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,359
investor right now that we are really

207
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,120
excited about

208
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,278
well the industry growth have you

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
watched the revenue in america i don't

210
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,439
know you do data better than me

211
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,039
uh but we have i think 25 billion

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,599
dollars in revenue this year and there

213
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,000
may be 30 in the world so you know this

214
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,320
is growing and through 2020 at a 60

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,440
revenue number is that right

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,440
in the year what's that

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,278
right and then the years before that

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,879
before coronavirus we were growing at a

219
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,120
23 to 30 in revenue number find me

220
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,360
another industry doing that with these

221
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,959
other things on top of that a similar

222
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
growth in taxes

223
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,719
give me much taxes we're paying places

224
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
that legalize this

225
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,240
a lot as you know

226
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,239
on top of that jobs

227
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,919
all these tech companies that are doing

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
great things not finding a tremendous

229
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,240
amount of real jobs there this is a

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,919
capital this is a consumer industry

231
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,080
built from a commodity so it's going to

232
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,519
require a lot of infrastructure and so

233
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,480
we're happy to report the jobs are

234
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,839
growing at a tremendous clip as well

235
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,680
on top of that

236
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
get ready for a bear market we're in the

237
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,399
longest bull market in history are we

238
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
not

239
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,000
cycles have to happen

240
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,920
there's no way to not have a cyclical

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,639
market it doesn't exist it's a test of

242
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,479
psychology and so it will happen

243
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,319
and so get ready for a place that is

244
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,480
going to be very excited for an industry

245
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,720
that is credit worthy when legal

246
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,839
think about all the infrastructure the

247
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,680
assets

248
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
this is an underwriter's dream in a bear

249
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,039
market we're getting calls already to

250
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
manage debt and credit because they

251
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,639
can't predict where they're going to

252
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,320
find yield

253
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,838
it's going to happen at some point and

254
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
this industry is only going to be more

255
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
interesting

256
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,000
assets credit worthiness banks are going

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,680
to need us more than they want

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,958
so these are four areas to really pay

259
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,399
attention to

260
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,239
that we're seeing be

261
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,720
very instrumental in bringing in the

262
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,720
institutional class

263
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,879
so really two groups we want to talk to

264
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,440
today and and frankly this is what at

265
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,838
arcadian we do really well

266
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,079

267
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,079

00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,360
at a number of places and encourage you

284
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,679
to spend some time with bo

285
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,600
if you are a resource provider to this

286
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,759
space

287
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,120
we'd love to hear from you

288
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,600
i are at arcadian cap or

289
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,200
arcadianfun.com and our commitment is to

290
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
serve you

291
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,278
it really is in this industry and if you

292
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
look at an emerging industry throughout

293
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,399
history

294
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
you need to be hedged

295
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,958
okay

296
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,200
there are a lot of amazing companies

297
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,799
here we've seen them all over the world

298
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,399
the interesting thing is

299
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,559
pre-institutionalization

300
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,159
you see a highly fragmented space

301
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,679
and so it needs to be put together if

302
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,319
you go back to the 90s and look at

303
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,679
google or facebook or apple or amazon

304
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,680
any of these companies that end up being

305
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,278
who they are today go look at the cap

306
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,958
table in the early days the a round the

307
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,879
b round the c round you're going to find

308
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,399
andreessen horowitz you're going to find

309
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,759
general catalyst you're going to find

310
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,278
benchmark

311
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,240
and so ultimately it's the investors job

312
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,919
to manage capital care about companies

313
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,680
invest throughout the whole supply chain

314
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,199
of an emerging industry and put it

315
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,439
together

316
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,519
see things from a macro level and so if

317
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,880
you're an investor here definitely pour

318
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,799
into these companies but i would

319
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,439
encourage you to reach out to the top

320
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,359
five or ten investors that have groups

321
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
doing this in the world and think about

322
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
that as an opportunity

323
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,519
but on the other hand our real job is to

324
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,279
provide return to those investors and so

325
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,879
if you're here and you run a company and

326
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,879
you're looking for resources raise your

327
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,879
hand

328
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,360
okay there's got to be more of you than

329
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,078
that so that means everyone else in here

330
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,079
is doing what

331
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,120
because you either have resources you

332
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,480
want to give to this industry or you

333
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,560
need them

334
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
and in either way it's okay

335
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,000
you come to arcadian and we're gonna

336
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,800
listen to you and figure out a way to

337
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,120

365
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,760
and i encourage you to do the same thing

366
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
set those intentions when you come in do

367
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,198
this the right way we're building

368
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,599
something real special here if you're in

369
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,838
this industry to trade in and out of it

370
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
we're gonna find you

371
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,360
we found you before

372
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,040
and you're gonna be probably not too

373
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,320
happy with the result because this

374
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,319
industry is about community friends

375
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,079
i promise you and it won't be any

376
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
different here ultimately the winners

377
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,120
are going to do it together

378
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,799
we were just talking about that weren't

379
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,799
we

380
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,039
we have companies that are in the same

381
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,559
category that are trying to figure out

382
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,838
and they're public

383
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,838
and they want to work together

384
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,279
that's what this is about that's what we

385
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,839
expect our companies to do and please

386
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,000
reach out to us if in fact you'd like to

387
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,000
have our team a part of yours we would

388
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,799
love that

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,559
um

390
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,639
there are three main phases to this

391
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,919
industry and as this one develops here

392
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,919
think about these and that is

393
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,599
the fundamental aspect the core the

394
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,519
foundation and what we've seen in other

395
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,399
markets is that would involve

396
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,159
cultivation retail manufacturing

397
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,759
these are very sensitive in different

398
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,879
places and it has to be figured out for

399
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:08,159
there to be any industry and so we think

400
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,559
about that today in most places uh in

401
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,240
larger markets is credit and debt

402
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,159
here we're going to be providing equity

403
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,079
for that line of business so just some

404
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,719
more information about the capital we

405
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,439
provide and in this market it would be

406
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,759
equity if you're in the u.s or a larger

407
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,480
market it would be credit and debt from

408
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,720
our perspective those multiples on

409
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,399
valuations won't get any higher than

410
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,399
they did in 2017 and 18 probably you had

411
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
agriculture businesses trading at 100

412
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,078
revenue

413
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,959
i mean not just not the case even in an

414
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,958
industry growing 40 to 60 so

415
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,198
that has been corrected now and there's

416
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,359
opportunity for credit and debt there we

417
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,559
think in the u.s and equity here as this

418
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,240
one builds the second phase being

419
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:56,078
well the the b2b side uh this is the uh

420
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,879
picks and axes of the industry if you

421
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,919
will

422
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,000
if you're a gold industry uh analyst you

423
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,838
look at the value of gold the industry

424
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,440
that takes it from the ground to the

425
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
consumer and ultimately what the use is

426
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,120
for the consumer

427
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,879
and that's the third aspect which is b2c

428
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,639
so all these we see grow in a little bit

429
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,159
different ways

430
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,519
we're looking at all of them here and we

431
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,799
encourage you to reach out to us if

432
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,639
you're involved in any of those aspects

433
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,679
one of the biggest things i think that

434
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,320
we have to think about in this space is

435
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,198
the esg component

436
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,199
here here we are in a world where

437
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,758
all of these industries that are large

438
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,559
and scaled they're trying to figure out

439
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
how to reverse engineer how to think

440
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,198
about the earth how to think about

441
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,639
animal welfare how to empower women in

442
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,278
the workplace how to think about

443
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,879
minorities in the workplace

444
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,759
well the great thing about this space is

445
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:52,159
we get to do that from the beginning

446
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,480
and so as you build this space here and

447
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,439
as you come across other people in it

448
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,959
encourage people to think this way

449
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
it's an important topic for us at

450
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,518
arcadian we ask all of our companies

451
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,359
these questions in order to verify

452
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,240
certain operational procedures that they

453
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,759
have

454
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
and so please do

455
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,119
think about that aspect as you build

456
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,038
this industry and if you come to us

457
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,519
we're going to ask you about it and try

458
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,720
to track it it's hard to do but we're

459
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,199
going to try to track all of those

460
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,600
characteristics because we believe that

461
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,480
if a market's about psychology

462
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,078
then what you're noticing is the 70 year

463
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,838
old community in the 60 year old

464
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,240
community and 50 as these decades

465
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:34,480
continue to grow the thinking behind the

466
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,960
younger generation is not just financial

467
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,798
there's other things that motivate it

468
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,480
and so watch these markets change

469
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,639
throughout the rest of your lifetime

470
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,160
there's a third component it's not just

471
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
is it cheaper

472
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,798
is it better

473
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,480
the markets now the people that make

474
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,079
decisions with that capital that are

475
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,558
continuing to grow up and take over

476
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,319
their father or grandfather's

477
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,480
capital they're asking themselves is

478
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,678
this better for the world is this better

479
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,919
for me watch the markets watch the

480
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,440
psychology behind it that's why you

481
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,200
should be encouraged what you're doing

482
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,798
right now will continue to matter

483
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
the thinkers behind the people that

484
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,720
provide all those resources think

485
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
differently

486
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,080
at the end of the day

487
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,639
we don't want to take a lot of your time

488
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,359
the way we think here

489
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,038
is that this is about

490
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,439
moving forward and either fear or faith

491
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,798
that's the future

492
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,798
you realize everything that ever

493
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,879
happened in your life before this moment

494
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,839
only lives in your head

495
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,840
that's a fact

496
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,720
everything that hadn't happened yet also

497
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,720
lives in your head

498
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:55,678
in the form of faith or fear really

499
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,359
and so why not choose hope

500
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,038
in what you're doing

501
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,199
it's working

502
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,640
it's working

503
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,200
and so

504
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,640
in some sense you think about this as

505
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,919
it's not what the world does to us

506
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,320
it's about what we do to the world

507
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,160
as individuals

508
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,879
and so if you don't believe me just

509
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,640
think about how data flows right

510
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,400
through the pure medial cell into the

511
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,919
brain

512
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,679
the only way in and out and then

513
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,679
ultimately there's a chandelier cell

514
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
it's there to repeat look at repeated

515
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,880
negative data patterns and in the event

516
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,839
that it does it starts to close down

517
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,440
your neural pathway to enter the brain

518
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,119
and then ultimately once it gets through

519
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,038
and hopefully you're balanced and

520
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,639
mindful in which case your chandelier

521
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,038
cell will open and you'll have a little

522
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,559
bit more flow into the brain it then

523
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:49,038
goes to what a 80 to 100 billion neurons

524
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,798
to be processed

525
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,480
that could be connected with 10 000

526
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,440
other neurons creating a neural network

527
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,880
that's absolutely insane and so this is

528
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,320
why it matters to be in the moment

529
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
because it's the only place you can make

530
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,158
a choice

531
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,079
here we are in this moment we wanted to

532
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,760
just use this time to try to

533
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,678
get people excited

534
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,440
you've heard a lot of information today

535
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,320
be here

536
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,120
all of the answers you wish to find in

537
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,879
life are in fact in the moment

538
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,639
they're right in front of you

539
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,640
if you're gonna play pay close enough

540
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,759
attention to them

541
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,759
and the reason for that is because

542
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,519
that's where data is processed

543
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,119
if you sit with the past and future too

544
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,359
much

545
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,798
you can't take in data from the moment

546
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,079
everything in the past and future is in

547
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,798
your head again

548
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,480
and so we just asked that

549
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,279
you pay attention to the moment you're

550
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,759
in

551
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,839
pay attention to the people around you

552
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,599
pay attention to arcadian

553
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,839
we've done a great job

554
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,959
at investing in companies and managing

555
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:51,038
capital for other people and so if any

556
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,038
of this aligns with you

557
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,599
let us know

558
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,359
we hope it does and frankly

559
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,038
we feel blessed to be here

560
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,359
and that's our choice to feel that way

561
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,720
thanks for having us um

562
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,719
appreciate you on the video too

563
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,720
do you have time for a few questions

564
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,759
matt nordgren

565
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,759
are there any questions

566
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
all right let's all go home then

567
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:20,678
uh let's hear one more time for matt

568
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,679
norgren from arcadian financial capital
