5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,039
journey this new legislation which means

6
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,039
that cannabis in no is not a narcotic

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,279
anymore it's a regular medicine which

8

can prescribed for almost any indication

9
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,960
