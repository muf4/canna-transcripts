1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,138
all right next panel the future of

2
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:17,169
Oregon cannabis

3
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:20,019
first lead off with kind of good news

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,240
the kind of big picture some things we

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:24,929
can all be proud of

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,309
first I want to mention when we first

7
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,469
legalized or first start working on

8
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,839
measure 91 to legalize cannabis here in

9
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,789
Oregon there were twelve thousand eight

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,488
hundred and eight Oregonians who were

11
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,988
arrested inside it for cannabis in 2012

12
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:39,849
and those are the latest stats when we

13
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:41,709
started the campaign last year using

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,929
those same statistics for people

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,969
arrested for cannabis where cannabis was

16
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,619
like the reason they were arrested that

17
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:50,170
was the most harmful thing they were

18
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:53,288
charged with that's down to 47 all right

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:57,969
so 47 people arrested inside of her

20
00:00:53,289 --> 00:01:00,129
cannabis last year right and 16 adults

21
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,820
that's it 21 juvenile 16 adults so we

22
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:03,189
can be proud of that

23
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,390
ragazzi proud of the fact that Senator

24
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:07,269
Merkley mentioned in his video this

25
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,700
morning we have doubled what the state

26
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,560
projected tax revenue would bring in

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,478
they projected 40 million at the most

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,280
every year we're on pace to bring an 80

29
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,170
million every year so we doubled that

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,239
projection funding schools drug

31
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,769
treatment programs putting that money to

32
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,780
good use I think we could put it to

33
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:24,579
other good uses as well and we've

34
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,340
created I think Governor Brown projects

35
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:30,039
we have 19,000 or so cannabis jobs have

36
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,899
been created but we got more work to do

37
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,118
we need to take care of patients we need

38
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:35,978
to sell more cannabis both in-state and

39
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,500
out-of-state and dress some other issues

40
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:41,259
so let me introduce the panel at large

41
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,989
and then I kick it off first I have a

42
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,670
lot of experience working with all these

43
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,270
fellows they're all great people on the

44
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,879
far end

45
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:51,819
Sam Chapman director of new revenue

46
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,509
coalition Sam helped lead the effort any

47
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:57,310
whatever Sam thank you Sam I helped lead

48
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,469
the effort to legalize medical cannabis

49
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,239
dispensaries in the legislature and now

50
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,670
he's at the legislature leading the

51
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,520
effort to legalize cannabis cafes and

52
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,259
other similar businesses think about the

53
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,478
cannabis model for winery tours

54
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,250
distillery tours things like that to

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,700
bring more tourism to the state provide

56
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,370
more jobs for our industry next to him

57
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:21,579
Casey Houlihan Oregon retailers or

58
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,310
garita or the cannabis Association Casey

59
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,040
a worthless a measure 91 it's a great

60
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,580
job working with the legislature to

61
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,819
protect

62
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,370
the the the industry of the retailers

63
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:35,919
who are the point of contact with the

64
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,500
general public and in many ways they're

65
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,199
the ambassadors for the program next to

66
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,530
him Adam Smith with the craft cannabis

67
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:47,019
Alliance Adam works with mom-and-pops

68
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,900
and he is leading the charge with one

69
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,670
fix cannabis to make sure that Oregon is

70
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,620
ready when the time is right and I think

71
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,259
the time is now to start exporting

72
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,689
cannabis across state and international

73
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:04,090
lines and go and then one of our biggest

74
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:11,829
allies in the legislature Oregon Senator

75
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:14,409
Floyd Pierzynski all right and Sam it's

76
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,000
a once you take it away talk about what

77
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,340
we're working on with a new revenue

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,289
coalition and the reasons why we got to

79
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,030
legalize and regulate cannabis cafes and

80
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,699
other businesses here in Oregon

81
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,830
sure thanks Anthony again Sam Chapman

82
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,899
new revenue coalition if you want to

83
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,610
learn more about us and new revenue

84
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,360
coalition com

85
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,340
so we founded the new revenue coalition

86
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,100
because there needed to be an organized

87
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,659
pack of industry members along with

88
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,569
folks who are not in the cannabis

89
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:46,509
industry who may just be consumers or

90
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,989
social justice advocates or housing

91
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:52,449
advocates or equity advocates to really

92
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,730
reframe the issue and the current

93
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:57,759
problem that we have with our existing

94
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:59,769
model of legalization which that more or

95
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,539
less it is a privileged form of

96
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,270
legalization and that if you don't own

97
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:06,929
your own home there's likely no legal

98
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,370
place for you to consume your cannabis

99
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,930
so that's something that we're working

100
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,659
on addressing in this legislative

101
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,090
session we've got a bill into

102
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,980
Legislative Council right now that would

103
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,418
do a couple of things and really quickly

104
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,910
I just want to get a raise instead how

105
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:27,599
do you retailers are in the room

106
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:30,550
retailers production processing cool

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,960
this you stand to benefit from this bill

108
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,250
every single one of you stands to

109
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,639
benefit from this bill let me tell you

110
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,589
why the first and main core concept that

111
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,800
we're looking to do with this bill is to

112
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:44,288
exempt cannabis from the indoor Clean

113
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,990
Air Act for those of you who don't know

114
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:49,659
cannabis was added in 2015 and that

115
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,199
means that you can't consume cannabis

116
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,390
inside very straightforward now that

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,949
created again quite a few problems for

118
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,750
folks who don't own their own homes

119
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,569
especially if you're in any type of

120
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,399
government assisted housing there was a

121
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,409
law that was just passed federally that

122
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,109
all federal housing is now smoke-free

123
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,060
and so the current law

124
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,819
disproportionately affects people of low

125
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,918
economic status and people of color and

126
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,930
I think that we've really got an

127
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,180
opportunity to address this in the

128
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,629
upcoming session so what does the bill

129
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,949
do one it allows retailers to co-locate

130
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:29,319
a consumption venue at their premise two

131
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:32,139
it extends that same ability to

132
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,209
processors and producers if you want to

133
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,668
have a brewery or vineyard model at your

134
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,978
farm or processing facility we think you

135
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:41,639
should be able to do that just like the

136
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:45,969
wine and brewery industries three

137
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,949
delivery to hotels the current law does

138
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,970
not allow delivery to hotels we think

139
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,009
that that's something that should be

140
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,840
allowed if you're a tourist and you're

141
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,689
coming to town you should not have to

142
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,810
walk around the corner smoke in an alley

143
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:01,719
in a park or in your rented car those

144
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,978
are public safety issues in our opinion

145
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,530
and we think that those need to be

146
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:08,649
addressed with sensible solutions and

147
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:11,319
three cannabis temporary event licenses

148
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:13,929
again this is not reinventing the wheel

149
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,668
this we have this for liquor now the

150
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,978
language that we've used and put in the

151
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:21,009
bill that we have at the moment directly

152
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:24,579
reflects existing language for alcohol

153
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:29,860
temporary event licenses and so that is

154
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:31,509
the general concept of the bill and I

155
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,569
think that the really important thing

156
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:36,909
for people here to recognize is that

157
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:39,219
this is not a done deal

158
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,140
right this is actually the second and

159
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,700
maybe depending on how much context you

160
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,339
have a previous session second and a

161
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,319
half attempt at pushing this through the

162
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:51,459
legislature and let me give you a little

163
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,069
context and 2017 I helped author and ran

164
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:54,889
a bill

165
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:57,379
Senate bill 307 that sought to simply

166
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:01,009
create a space for people to consume at

167
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,689
retailers right now the folks that we

168
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,959
need to work with and that we at least

169
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:08,149
need to get to neutral our public health

170
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,729
and law enforcement and mainly Public

171
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,739
Health they have a lot of the same

172
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,740
reefer madness concerns that we have

173
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,420
heard for decades they also have some

174
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,280
legitimate concerns that we very much

175
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,020
need to address and I think that it's

176
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,199
really important that the industry knows

177
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:26,959
that in that there will be concessions

178
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,879
in these conversations right if I had it

179
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,199
my way you'd be able to buy cannabis and

180
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,659
alcohol consume it in the same place

181
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,370
right we're not there yet right so there

182
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,810
are incremental aspects of this

183
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,569
political process that we need to go

184
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,300
through in 2017 we took our first step

185
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,949
in that process so we had a bill that

186
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,090
would allow this to happen out retailers

187
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:50,629
we had three stakeholder group meetings

188
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:53,419
and in every meeting we compromised we

189
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:56,180
compromised we compromised and by the

190
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,280
third meeting the bill had been watered

191
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,519
down so much to where it just codified

192
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:04,429
existing law which and my non legal

193
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,579
opinion means if you're outside not on

194
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,829
an olcc licensed premise and you're not

195
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:12,680
in a view of the public you can consume

196
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:14,379
cannabis that was what Public Health

197
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,610
told us that they needed to go neutral

198
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,649
well it turns out they weren't very

199
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:22,009
genuine and telling us that because they

200
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:23,120
they still opposed our bill so we're

201
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:26,779
coming in with a very different strategy

202
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,120
for the 2019 session you know that's

203
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,589
politics right I do my best every day to

204
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,389
make sure that I don't take those things

205
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:34,129
personally that's part of the game and

206
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,960
we can play that game too

207
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:39,110
and I think that part of the new

208
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,690
strategy this time around is one you

209
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,090
know we're asking for everything we want

210
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,070
right everything that we deserve and we

211
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,139
understand that that may be a tall order

212
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,510
for some folks who may not quite

213
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:52,309
understand who we are and that we're

214
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,939
also normal people we just have a

215
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:56,979
different you know

216
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,130
choice two we choose a different way to

217
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:03,690
relax or we just you know we're not the

218
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:07,090
same exact people but we do believe that

219
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:12,790
it's something that we just deserve the

220
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:15,639
freedom to have so basically what we're

221
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:16,719
doing is we're gonna work with public

222
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,069
health and law enforcement we're

223
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,050
genuinely coming back to the table with

224
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:24,090
them we had a first what I believe to be

225
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:26,559
a very productive work group meeting and

226
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,300
you know I think that we've got a real

227
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,669
shot at getting this through the

228
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:35,309
building this session but it's not gonna

229
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:38,620
be done without two major things one a

230
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:43,209
well organized and well financed

231
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,879
lobbying effort and to a community

232
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,070
organizing bottom-up lobbying effort

233
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,110
this is not an issue that is going to

234
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,070
get passed just through top-down

235
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,019
lobbying this is going to require

236
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,300
constituents to be activated consumers

237
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,730
to talk to their representatives to set

238
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:02,979
up meetings and say I deserve a legal

239
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,230
place to consume this legal product and

240
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,300
if we're not if we can't do that this

241
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,659
will not pass it's that simple

242
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:13,990
and so if you live here in Oregon and

243
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:16,809
you are willing to contact your

244
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,419
representative send an email host a

245
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:21,549
house party volunteer in one way or

246
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:24,759
another if you've got a special skill I

247
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:27,189
want to hear from you because it's gonna

248
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,710
take all of us to get this done and it's

249
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,510
not just going to be the lobbyists in

250
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:35,170
the building it's gonna need to be the

251
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:37,840
people and the voters that let their kid

252
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:42,279
that let the representatives know that

253
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:46,269
they want this so the other aspect of

254
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,559
the strategy is if we are not able to

255
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,480
get something through the building this

256
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,969
session we're simply gonna go to the

257
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,810
ballot that ruffles a lot of folks

258
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,310
feathers to be honest but it's a card

259
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:59,379
that we have to keep in our back pocket

260
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,209
if folks that we are required to work

261
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,279
with in the building are not willing to

262
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,139
work with us that's fine there's another

263
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,009
avenue that we can go to and frankly

264
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:09,159
with 500 and

265
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,720
seventy-eight retailers in the state

266
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:14,089
most of which would stand to benefit in

267
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,740
one form or another from this bill we

268
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,710
think that those retailers Act there's

269
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:22,190
pretty great conduits to constituents to

270
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:24,889
consumers to voters and it's there's

271
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,050
plenty of campaign plans out there that

272
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:30,230
can show us how to utilize those

273
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:32,599
connectors to organize you know a

274
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,480
groundswell of constituent support the

275
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,240
legislature has never seen on a cannabis

276
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,789
issue like this before this can assume

277
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,759
this issue of consumer equity is one

278
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:46,339
that stands to mobilize consumers in

279
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,799
ways that you've never seen before and I

280
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,080
think that on top of the opportunities

281
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,959
that are presented in that type of

282
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,940
organizing model it also really is

283
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,519
something that you should consider as a

284
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,040
business decision if you're the cannabis

285
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,970
industry you already know your business

286
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,049
is politics and all politics are local

287
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,970
if you're not paying attention to local

288
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:09,319
politics you're probably not paying

289
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,810
attention to your business very much

290
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,940
right the same is to be said for this

291
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,189
issue and I think it's really important

292
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,600
that people understand that lobbying

293
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,460
isn't necessarily the most glorious

294
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,070
thing in the world but that's how you

295
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,600
get [ __ ] done and that's what we need

296
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,960
from everyone we need everyone to be

297
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,540
able to pitch in resources time

298
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,879
connections whatever you have I'd love

299
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,990
to hear from you and I'm not gonna have

300
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,789
a whole lot of time to hang out after

301
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,580

in our CPAC at gmail.com Sam this one

315
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,318
quick question for you you mentioned in

316
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,539
a dream world you'd like to see cannabis

317
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:18,068
and alcohol served at the same

318
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:20,169
establishments will that same

319
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:23,198
establishment be able to have a chrome

320
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:26,828
as well who all went to the axe-throwing

321
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:28,628
last night the occ go to axe-throwing

322
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:30,758
last night all right I'm just saying

323
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,709
like if we can legally drink beer and

324
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,659
throw axes and just sign a waiver like

325
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:38,698
the safer alternative is smoking weed

326
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:38,698
and throwing axes so let's look all

327
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,980
right mister Adam Smith take us away on

328
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:53,019
why we need an export cannabis and how

329
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,850
we're gonna do it I'm from New York so I

330
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,528
talked fast and I only have a little bit

331
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,749
of time and a lot of stuff to go over so

332
00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:00,879
try to stay with me I know it's early in

333
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:02,139
the morning my name is Adam Smith I'm

334
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,759
the founder and executive director of

335
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,808
the craft cannabis Alliance we are a

336
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,178
mission-driven

337
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:10,600
trade association representing companies

338
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:12,610
large and small that are majority Oregon

339
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,769
owned that have made a commitment to

340
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,778
sustainability ethical business and

341
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,089
employment practices positive community

342
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:20,259
engagement and ending the drug war I'm

343
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,119
not here to talk about the craft

344
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,519
cannabis Alliance today that's who we

345
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:25,660
are before I get into export I just want

346
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,159
to note something because I'm not sure

347
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:30,338
who will say this from the stage today

348
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,928
but the FBI numbers came out and Anthony

349
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:34,149
referenced the fact that we are only

350
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:36,659
we've only arrested 47 people last year

351
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,188
in Oregon for cannabis but nationwide

352
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:42,159
those numbers actually went up this past

353
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:43,778
year we arrested over 600,000 people

354
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,338
across the country so if you are in the

355
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:47,889
cannabis industry if you make your

356
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:50,199
living from the cannabis industry okay I

357
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:52,360
know in Oregon we're not making a ton of

358
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,969
money from the cannabis industry but if

359
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,860
we are we have our fingers on this pot

360
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,089
of gold on this bag of gold but the only

361
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,769
reason that's true is because we're

362
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,259
standing on a mountain of 80 years of

363
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,589
ruined lives and destroyed community and

364
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:07,659
we have a moral ethical cultural and

365
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:10,600
financial obligation to make sure that

366
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:12,389
we are funding ending the drug war writ

367
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:18,519
large not just

368
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:20,289
so may I suggest may I may I suggest if

369
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,519
you're looking for ways to do that may I

370
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,879
suggest students for sensible drug

371
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,069
policy normal the drug policy Alliance

372
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,200
Marijuana Policy Project whether that's

373
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,920
local or national think about being part

374
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,270
of the solution

375
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:36,088
now or again how we got here how many

376
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:38,620
people here do business in Oregon

377
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,580
alright awesome how many people here

378
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,519
would be in favor of being able to

379
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,778
export products out of Oregon excellent

380
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,990
we got a friendly crowd all right I'm

381
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:49,149
gonna stand up how did we leave the

382
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,339
photo all right

383
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,769
so how do we get here Oregon decided I

384
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:56,470
think it was a smart idea we decided to

385
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:58,329
legalize the industry we had here in

386
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,610
Oregon we actually ran a campaign called

387
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,528
go legal and the campaign was not about

388
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,350
bring your big multinational here buy up

389
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,299
a bunch of farms and set up shop the

390
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,159
campaign was that we had an industry

391
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,649
here have had an industry here for

392
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,179
generations and we wanted to make it

393
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,070
feasible for all of those folks that

394
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:17,259
have been participating to continue

395
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,050
participating on the legal side this was

396
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,730
a good instinct we legalized the

397
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:23,829
industry we had the state said come on

398
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,240
in and thousands of people did the

399
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,370
problem is it turned out the industry we

400
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,360
had was largely an export industry and

401
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:33,250
so folks got we had medical obviously

402
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,720
right but for generations we've been

403
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,519
we've been feeding the west coast has

404
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,850
been feeding the end of the nation's

405
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,980
cannabis desires and doing a wall and so

406
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,450
we roped in all of this product we said

407
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,700
go ahead everybody grow when we turned

408
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:49,420
around and you know with cheap and easy

409
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,250
licensing and boom we have a glut right

410
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:53,289
Billy Williams the US attorney here

411
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,750
calls it a problem I like to call it a

412
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:57,250
bounty right we have a bounty but if you

413
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,169
think things are bountiful now wait till

414
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,120
California gets their licensing on track

415
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:04,869
it's gonna be very bountiful on the west

416
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,299
coast right Oregon is an export state

417
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,129
and we have always been an export state

418
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,779
and that is how our and that is how this

419
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,980
will function going forward and that's

420
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:16,119
the future for Oregon so but what we

421
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,338
have right now is we have a number of

422
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,928
problems number one we have the problem

423
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:22,269
that we've had since the beginning of

424
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,030
prohibition which is we are exporting

425
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:24,829
like

426
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:26,119
not the second problem we have is that

427
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,009
we have producer counties that don't

428
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,859
have resources enough resources coming

429
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:33,559
in to enforce regulation and the third

430
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:36,349
problem is that we are on the brink of

431
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,210
an economic catastrophe in Oregon a

432
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:40,159
real-time economic crisis we have

433
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,350
hundreds of millions of dollars of local

434
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,420
capital that is on the verge of being

435
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:47,599
wiped out that that stands to be wiped

436
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,789
out over the next 12 to 24 months right

437
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,639
and this is not Nikes local capital or

438
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:54,889
Intel's local capital this is the local

439
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,630
capital of thousands of people who have

440
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,000
gone all in to be part of this legal

441
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,370
industry right and if this was any other

442
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,869
industry if we had this kind of local

443
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:04,939
capital and thousands of jobs at

444
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:06,319
imminent risk we would have political

445
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,670
leadership coming from everywhere

446
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,129
screaming at the federal government to

447
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,350
open up markets for our hazelnuts or

448
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,510
filbert's you know for a salmon for a

449
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:16,759
grass seed whatever it is but it's

450
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:20,839
cannabis so it's touchy but it's not

451
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:24,170
touchy right we are looking at we are in

452
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,669
the midst of a sea change nationally a

453
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,680
couple of months ago

454
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,480
New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo came

455
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,920
out and said you know it's not a matter

456
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,509
of if New York should legalize cannabis

457
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,610
it's how New York should legalize

458
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:36,710
cannabis right well right now under the

459
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:38,119
current system the way things are if New

460
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,460
York wants to legalize cannabis tomorrow

461
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,559
they would have to create from scratch a

462
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,150
production industry approximately four

463
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,730
to five times larger than Oregon's

464
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,259
production industry right that's not

465
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,779
that's not they're competitive and or

466
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:52,519
economically feasible right I mean you

467
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:55,000
can grow oranges in New York too if you

468
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,980
want right it's not a good business plan

469
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,809
right and so not saying that folks in

470
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,950
New York shouldn't grow but they should

471
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:02,450
grow if they believe they can be

472
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,680
competitive with West Coast cannabis

473
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,410
coming because West Coast cannabis is

474
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,080
going to come and it may take until it

475
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,240
you know it may take until federal

476
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,519
prohibition ends but that day is coming

477
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,890
and so let's we should we need to look

478
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:20,150
economically toward what is the future

479
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,290
of this industry so to fix all of those

480
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,519
problems right

481
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,809
so let me just go back wait the US

482
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,349
Attorney Billy Williams said this is out

483
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,450
of control

484
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:28,339
right there's diversion from the legal

485
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,519
market there is illicit growing there is

486
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:33,769
organized crime and you know and to some

487
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,558
extent that is not untrue right but it

488
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:37,480
has been such since the beginning

489
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:39,428
prohibition right prohibition didn't

490
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,319
work it doesn't work now the state is

491
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,240
not going to suddenly become able to

492
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,980
make prohibition work right so the

493
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,870
question is not showing an export or not

494
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,259
the question is how is Oregon going to

495
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:52,538
export is it going to export ad hoc

496
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:53,980
illegally unregulated in ways that make

497
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:56,648
everybody including the US attorney

498
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,628
unhappy or is it going to do this in a

499
00:19:56,648 --> 00:20:01,028
way that is regulated going into states

500
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:03,369
that want it into license hands to go to

501
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:05,589
adults where we get revenues back that

502
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,778
is the only question so we have decided

503
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:09,519
that it is time to push that question

504
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:11,200
and we started we have started a

505
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,499
campaign called one fix cannabis where

506
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,259
one stands for Oregon needs export okay

507
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:19,868
and there's there is a and let me tell

508
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,240
you right up front our goal is to export

509
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:26,378
product legally from Oregon by the end

510
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,579
of 2020 we are we plan to send product

511
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:33,579
out of Oregon by the end of 2020 because

512
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:36,368
because if it takes four years to get to

513
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:37,569
export or five years then there's a

514
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,308
really good chance that eighty or ninety

515
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,168
percent of the local industry who here

516
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:42,519
will be no more right we have large

517
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:44,230
companies that have come in here and

518
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,179
they have every right to be here and

519
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,499
they're buying up farms and buying up

520
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:51,369
retail and buying up brands right and

521
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,319
they're not here because they think

522
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:56,589
they're gonna get rich selling cannabis

523
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,329
to Oregonians right you know it's not

524
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,428
too much hyperbole to say it's possible

525
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,868
that you know the last profitable dollar

526
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,519
has already been made selling cannabis

527
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:05,378
to Oregon eum's right they are here

528
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,548
because there is an Oregon brand of

529
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:08,109
cannabis and when those walls come down

530
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:11,528
we are gonna have a multi-billion dollar

531
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:12,878
export industry right but there's a

532
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:15,788
really good chance that if it takes too

533
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:17,558
long there's gonna be some small number

534
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:18,999
of large deep-pocketed companies that

535
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:20,918
have outlasted and bought out everybody

536
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:22,868
else who will only who will own the

537
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,159
Oregon brand globally and we will turn

538
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,959
around and have this multi-billion

539
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,039
dollar industry and we will say wow what

540
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,740
a shame we don't really have a

541
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,118
significant ownership stake here

542
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,288
now I have good friends that work for

543
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:33,759
some of these large companies and if we

544
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,990
took a snapshot of the Oregon industry

545
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,639
right now and that's how this went

546
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,109
forward with the mix that we have of

547
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:39,878
outside companies inside companies we

548
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:42,008
would ever help the ecosystem but we're

549
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:43,449
not trending in that direction and the

550
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,429
longer it takes us to open up new

551
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,278
markets the harder and harder it's going

552
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,919
to get for us

553
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,509
have an industry that is of Oregon and

554
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,099
make no mistake the reason that the

555
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,348
Oregon has a brand globally for a

556
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:58,339
cannabis is exactly because of that

557
00:21:54,348 --> 00:22:00,558
artisan craft right industry that has

558
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:03,168
worked for generations to create the

559
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,848
best cannabis on the planet right and so

560
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:06,950
it is valuable to everyone for that to

561
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:08,839
survive so what are we doing I'm gonna

562
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,009
close this up what are we doing the one

563
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,569
fixed cannabis campaign it's a

564
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:13,519
three-step process the first thing we

565
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,048
absolutely have to do is we have to pass

566
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,608
a bill and Senate presents key I believe

567
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:18,499
is going to help us do that that is

568
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:20,329
going to allow us that are gonna make it

569
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:21,858
legal under state law de to approve

570
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:23,658
transfers for the governor's office

571
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:26,118
through all 62 approved transfers out of

572
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,379
state right now if cannabis became legal

573
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:28,819
tomorrow federally it would still be

574
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:30,769
illegal under Oregon law for us to

575
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:32,538
approve out-of-state transfers we need

576
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:34,788
to get that out of the way that doesn't

577
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:36,710
get product out of the state but it gets

578
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:38,329
them it gets the legislature out of the

579
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,788
way so that when the time comes we are

580
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:42,618
able to jump on that opportunity right

581
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:44,419
and and the other thing we need to

582
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:46,459
understand is that we don't the

583
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:48,499
situation the federal level is fluid

584
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,058
right it's not about waiting for the

585
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:52,038
federal government to legalize cannabis

586
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:53,509
we have never made an advance in

587
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,519
cannabis policy in the last 40 years

588
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:56,868
because the federal government decided

589
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,229
to make something legal and say here go

590
00:22:56,868 --> 00:23:02,689
ahead do it never not once they have not

591
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:03,019
legalized medical yet we would still be

592
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,048
waiting

593
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:08,749
we can't wait right so what we need to

594
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:10,548
do is get the make it legal in Oregon we

595
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:13,190
need to pass this bill it is vital it's

596
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:15,259
a necessary first step that campaign to

597
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,509
pass the bill is also a platform to tell

598
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:19,608
this story nationally about the future

599
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:20,989
of the economics in cannabis and find

600
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,759
our partners around the state that are

601
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:25,759
going to lobby for their state to allow

602
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:28,338
import whether that's New York or New

603
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,348
Jersey or Nevada or Utah's medical

604
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:31,668
program or Oklahoma's medical program we

605
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:33,950
need to punch a hole in the wall we need

606
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,690
to make a transfer from Oregon's system

607
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,338
into another state's legal system that

608
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,109
the states approve and the federal

609
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,338
government let's happen once that

610
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:43,608
happens we are an entirely different

611
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:45,408
world and so we need to bring it right

612
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:46,878
up to the wine and look at the federal

613
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:48,489
government and force them to make a

614
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:50,569
decision are you going to enforce

615
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:52,600
against two state governors that have

616
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,639
decided they're ready to move

617
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,549
and that this is going to help clear up

618
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,720
the illicit market and that's what we

619
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:03,759
need to get okay and so I want to thank

620
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,559

on their shelves whether it's a state

651

brother name is Casey Houlihan I'm the

659
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:40,769
executive director of the Oregon

660
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,960
retailers of cannabis Association we

661
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:44,670
represent over 350 cannabis businesses

662
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,019
in the industry across the state many of

663
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,120
them are retailers but we also have

664
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,680
producers and processors you name it

665
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,739
several of whom I believe are here today

666
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,180
yeah great yeah and if you're not a

667
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,308
member to talk to us after we'll be here

668
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,480
all day I'm gonna echo a lot of what you

669
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:59,250
just heard from both of these speakers

670
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,200
there's a lot that we're working on for

671
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,759
the upcoming legislative session in 2019

672
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,990
and it's going to be a unique session in

673
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,849
a couple of ways that I wanted to point

674
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,960
out this will be the first long session

675
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:09,629
that we've had in the legislature for

676
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,429
some time without a specific committee

677
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,559
dedicated to focusing on cannabis

678
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:14,480
related policy that does mean that we

679
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:16,259
are going to be competing with

680
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,240
traditional industries and other

681
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:20,339
interest groups at the Capitol for basic

682
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,900
bandwidth for room on you know committee

683
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:23,250
hearings and just to make sure that we

684
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,840
can get their time and attention for

685
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,220
this so a lot of what we're seeing is

686
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,959
the culmination of efforts from a lot of

687
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,220
the folks up here but they've been doing

688
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,990
for years at this point and that's

689
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,069
exactly the type of time frame that

690
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,569
we're typically looking at for getting

691
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:35,970
these substantive policy measures passed

692
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:37,079
it's years after years and so one of the

693
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,480
other reasons I'm very excited about

694
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,549
this upcoming session is that we've also

695
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,380
made more progress than ever before

696
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:45,299
we have more advocates and allies on our

697
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,130
side than ever before we've added more

698
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,480
legislators to the positive columns for

699
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,400
all three or all all two of these

700
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,750
legislation bills that these guys are

701
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,940
talking about as well as the others and

702
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,829
I'm going to mention here our number one

703
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,900
focus is Adam pointed out is also going

704
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:59,669
to be making sure that we can get a

705
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,530
reasonable export policy for this state

706
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,808
because as you all know we are wildly

707
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:05,670
saturated on the production side and the

708
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,470
biggest solution that we could possibly

709
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,058
have would be to get that to another

710
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,200
state that needs it we can get more

711
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:12,210
money into the pockets of the growers

712
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,140
here and actually I think at the capital

713
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,670
will probably start referring to that

714
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,980
bility or cannabis industry full

715
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,269
employment act of 2019 because there's

716
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,769
nothing else we could do to help the

717
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,129
jobs outlook in this state in this

718
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:22,129
industry

719
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,629
it's a Sam's point as well and this is

720
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,860
actually one of the other elements

721
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,090
that's going to be new we have more

722
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,189
forces and more groups that are

723
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:32,779
coalesced around a lot of these specific

724
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,309
issues and driving support for these

725
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,259
specific issues than we've seen

726
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,569
historically and it's a really effective

727
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:40,129
mechanism at adding support so that's

728
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:41,059
another area where especially when we're

729
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,830
talking about something very

730
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,450
controversial like social consumption

731
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,250
where clearly there have been some

732
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,990
stakeholders particularly the public

733
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,670
health advocates who have been very

734
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,009
obstinate in their opposition to this

735
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,660
this is another area where after years

736
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:55,339
of making small progress and getting

737
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,360
more allies on our side then I think

738
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:58,279
this is going to be the best chance

739
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:59,419
we've had yet to get this type of bill

740
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,339
through and it's really important that

741
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,050
we all get behind it and make sure that

742
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:05,209
we can show our support for those

743
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,139
lobbying efforts as well a couple of the

744
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,910
other things that I know that we've

745
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,680
discussed in past sessions and our

746
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,930
association is looking to bring back up

747
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,340
as well is actually a bill that was

748
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,130
introduced by Senator presents key in

749
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:18,589
2017 as I believe SB 301 at the time

750
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,390
which would have eliminated employment

751
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:22,159
discrimination for off-hours cannabis

752
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,450
use and this is an important one because

753
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,769
there's still a great deal of folks out

754
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,900
there who are concerned about losing

755
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:29,000
their job or employment or financial

756
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,500
security if they consume cannabis this

757
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,690
is another example of Sam pointed out of

758
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,650
privileged legalization so we think that

759
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,539
this is something that everybody should

760
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,280
be able to have access to nobody should

761
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,409
be punished or deprived of an economic

762
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,509
opportunity because they choose a safer

763
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,509
legal intoxicant in the state of Oregon

764
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:46,190
so this is an area where consumers can

765
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:47,779
really directly provide a lot of input

766
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,269
and carry quite a bit of the weight of

767
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,279
these measures we're trying to advocate

768
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:54,079
for in session Sam inappropriately

769
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,490
pointed out that a grassroots effort on

770
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,679
this can be extremely impactful to

771
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,690
legislators and especially on an area

772
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,430
like this where so many consumers

773
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,990
directly would be impacted by this type

774
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,029
of policy this is one where we

775
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,200
especially as retailers can reach out to

776
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:08,000
our consumers to make sure they

777
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,710
understand to advocate for their

778
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,180
interests and to talk to their state

779
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,680
representatives and their state senators

780
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,850
to make sure that they support these

781
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,320
bills as well

782
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,609
lastly I also wanted to talk about

783
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:19,189
another bill that we're working on to

784
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:20,649
vacate automatically passed cannabis

785
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,549
convictions for folks that had been

786
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,330
victimized by the prohibition on

787
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:25,339
cannabis in the war on drugs

788
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:26,720
historically there is a path right now

789
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:29,149
for getting those types of charges

790
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,680
expunged however it is fairly circuitous

791
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,840
it's fairly time-consuming and it's

792
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,140
relatively costly and as such many folks

793
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,939
have

794
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,990
taking advantage of it that could so

795
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,700
this is something that we would like to

796
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,049
have done at the state level in statutes

797
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,819
but it can happen automatically for

798
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:42,079
those past offenses and folks don't have

799
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:43,549
to jump through a series of Hoops to

800
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,539
have something stricken from the record

801
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:47,210
that shouldn't have been there in the

802
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:48,379
first place I also I wear two hats in

803
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,940
the industry I also worked with BDS

804
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,040
analytics which market research and data

805
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,779
firm so I do operate kind of at the

806
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,710
cross section of policy and data so

807
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:56,960
there was a couple things I wanted to

808
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,640
mention just in terms of consumer power

809
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,680
from the cannabis consumer perspective

810
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,030
there are so many lobbying groups right

811
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,519
now that happened nationally that work

812
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:06,500
nationally that are essentially consumer

813
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,910
organizations I think the NRA is one of

814
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,859
the most powerful typically that folks

815
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,810
think of and that's because gun sales

816
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:13,189
are massive thirty percent of Americans

817
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,440
currently report that they own firearm

818
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,120
and estimated right now between nine and

819
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,809
ten billion dollars in North American

820
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,389
gun sales

821
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:23,029
however in states that have legalized

822
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,830
ation policy consumer insight research

823
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,629
that we have done has shown that thirty

824
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:28,159
two percent of folks in those legal

825
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,070
states have consumed cannabis in the

826
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,420
last six months and in 2017 legal

827
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:34,129
cannabis sales were nine point seven

828
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,690
billion dollars in North America in

829
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,730
about four years they're anticipated to

830
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,080
go up to twenty four billion so we're

831
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,730
gonna be running circles around some of

832
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,649
the the biggest interest groups in the

833
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,000
country in terms of how many sales

834
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,620
they're bringing in relative to ours and

835
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,849
this is an area where you can vote with

836
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:48,259
your voice you can vote with your dollar

837
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:50,539
you can connect with your representative

838
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:51,950
but we are a seasoned constituency that

839
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:53,420
at this point needs to have our voice

840
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,799
heard and we need to finish the job of

841
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:01,670
legalization that we started four years

842
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:04,430
ago thank you Thank You Casey Casey

843
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:07,130
how can people Casey how can people find

844
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,410
you online Casey how can people find you

845
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,240
online to get involved we were at Oregon

846
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,710
cannabis retailers calm and we also have

847
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,700
a table right out there and chat with us

848
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,519
all day thank you

849
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,710
all right let's hear from our ally and

850
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:20,480
what for your perspective Senator

851
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,579
presence key from from inside the

852
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,529
legislative building all right thank you

853
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:26,359
so I think it's important to kind of

854
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:28,369
take a step back to look at where we

855
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,919
were and where we are today I think Adam

856
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:34,309
brought a very distinct point of the

857
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,039
diversion that we have back in 2015

858
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,599
after the measure 91 was passed in 14

859
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,059
that's when we had a supercommittee that

860
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:43,639
was opened up there are ten members five

861
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:47,359
senators and five representatives

862
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,940
was one of the vice chairs of the that

863
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,009
committee during that process it came

864
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,529
very clear that we needed to do certain

865
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:57,289
things to ensure that we weren't going

866
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:59,389
to have this glut of product on the

867
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:01,369
market we had testimony that told us

868
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,160
that we already had within the medical

869
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:05,329
program that had been in existence since

870
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:09,019
98 when it was passed and started

871
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:12,230
growing in 99 so about 14 years three to

872
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:14,809
five times as much product flour already

873
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,269
being grown in the state without even

874
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:20,329
going into the recreational system and

875
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:22,849
that was based on research that an

876
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:24,439
individual and OSU had done what we took

877
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:25,759
from that and what I took from that was

878
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,509
that we needed to have a bill that was

879
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:33,920
going to limit new production for

880
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:35,480
growers to limit new people coming in

881
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,640
out of state so basically a residency

882
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,680
requirement we had a bill that actually

883
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,320
was going to require a four-year

884
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,120
residency program so he could in fact

885
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,519
allow for the mom and pops throughout

886
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:49,069
this state that were the roots of this

887
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,740
program of what we're now benefiting

888
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:54,230
from to be able to transition into the

889
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,269
open market what we're going to also do

890
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,950
is not keep someone from coming into the

891
00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:00,289
state but they were gonna get what would

892
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,730
be called a vertical license a license

893
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:03,740
that would allow them to grow for their

894
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,509
own need and use but they would not be

895
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,059
able to flood the market with their

896
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:10,190
flour or their extracts or any other

897
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,539
processing into the open market they'd

898
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,180
have to sell it through their own retail

899
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:15,649
that would self regulate them as to how

900
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,450
much they grew because they can only

901
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,269
sell it within their own retail outlet

902
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,299
or through their own processing we know

903
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:25,609
that that would limit the addition and

904
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:27,980
will allow for everyone else who are

905
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:31,369
Oregonians before we had this transition

906
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:33,769
coming in to actually have a place at

907
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:35,839
the table have an existing market and

908
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:38,119
actually be able to come in from being

909
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,480
on the outs and being in a regulated

910
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:43,879
industry now what we have seen since

911
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,549
then is is glut we know with what we're

912
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,710
dealing with and so in 2017 I did in

913
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:49,529
fact introduced a bill Senate bill 20

914
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,750
excuse me

915
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:53,369
and 42 so if you're interested in

916
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,579
looking at it you can go to the Oregon

917
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:59,009
legislators legislative website and you

918
00:33:56,579 --> 00:34:02,819
go to the bills go to the sessions first

919
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:07,289
pick the 2017 session and then look up

920
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:12,389
SB 1042 what 10:42 called for was to

921
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:15,900
establish a a process for the governor

922
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:19,049
to be able to enter into compacts with

923
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:21,659
adjacent states that had met had

924
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:24,510
marijuana programs either medical and/or

925
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:26,280
recreational programs so here in Oregon

926
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,520
we now have adjacent states of

927
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,130
California Nevada and Washington this

928
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,349
would in fact allow for those who are in

929
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:37,140
the process of growing that want to be

930
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:39,119
able to get a return for their product

931
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:42,059
to actually be able to have it go across

932
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,130
state lines now what we've realized is

933
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:46,440
that through this drafting we needed to

934
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,900
have a mechanism that would keep it from

935
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,059
being exclusively regulated by the feds

936
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,918
and that is through ground

937
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:54,599
transportation it's my belief from

938
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,089
working with our legislative council

939
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,960
that we could in fact do that because

940
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:02,280
only air and marine meaning water

941
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,869
transportation it's exclusively

942
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,390
regulated by the feds

943
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,769
so unfortunately even though I got the

944
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:10,349
bill passed out of my Senate Judiciary

945
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:12,809
Committee it went to another committee

946
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:15,509
and the leadership chose not to move the

947
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:16,829
bill that bill will be reintroduced we

948
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,930
will be looking at potential

949
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:20,519
modifications and an adam says one of

950
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:22,589
the things that we want to be as an

951
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,269
exporting state this is my vision as

952
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,070
well because we have seen it we know it

953
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:28,380
will be there and the reality there's

954
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,050
little that any other states going to be

955
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,360
able to do to outdo our state and our

956
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,190
growers because they're so renowned as

957
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,110
to what they do do and with the success

958
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,710
that they've had in the medical

959
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:43,500
application so why would a state that

960
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,210
has no medical growing program want to

961
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,340
try to establish that program now

962
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,409
clearly they can do that if New York

963
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,660
wants to do that so be it but guess what

964
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:53,339
we know that we have a brand we know

965
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,099
that we have growers who have been able

966
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,470
to identify attributes of their their

967
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,500
strains to help individuals and medical

968
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:01,059
needs and as

969
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,340
heard from veterans in front of my

970
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,599
committee the bottom line is they want

971
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,190
to be able to function they want to be

972
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,989
part of society they want to be able to

973
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,030
take care of their families they can't

974
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:14,079
do on opiates but they can do it but

975
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:15,610
they have access to quality strains of

976
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,409
marijuana that actually will benefit

977
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,970
them so that's one of the things we want

978
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:21,219
to do and this is now taken off to

979
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:23,169
another step just this week I had

980
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:26,319
individuals coming in from California

981
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:29,320
who represents the rural counties who

982
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,570
are looking at 10:42 as how they can

983
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,300
actually start working on their side of

984
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,220
the state boundary to actually implement

985
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,500
that so we can see that so you may see

986
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:40,359
the first two states actually doing this

987
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,280
would between us in California but I

988
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,210
still want to have that opening for

989
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,490
everywhere else

990
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,740
meaning adjacent states the other

991
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:49,719
everywhere else I'm afraid that it's

992
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:51,729
going to take a piece of legislation on

993
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:55,419
the federal side I think it's very

994
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:57,940
doable because we have 29 plus states in

995
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,320
DC that are doing medical programs so I

996
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,240
think the first step that you're going

997
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,820
to see on the federal side will be a

998
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:06,549
laxing allowing for transfer of medical

999
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,039
marijuana between states that allow for

1000
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:11,380
medical marijuana that will allow us to

1001
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,619
go interstate commerce that will in fact

1002
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,660
allow us to ship by air or by water to

1003
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:19,299
other states that are not adjacent to us

1004
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:21,159
and that's a key component that we need

1005
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,070
to actually expand this out as Adam

1006
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:25,659
would like to do and the other thing I

1007
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,820
think that we need to do for diversion

1008
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:30,069
and dealing with this is taking off the

1009
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,710
20 pound limit for medical transfers

1010
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,269
into the recreational system if we have

1011
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,550
a problem and we've heard from Billy

1012
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:39,130
Williams we've heard from others that it

1013
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:41,710
is the outdoor growing in Southern

1014
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,980
Oregon the place the birth spot for

1015
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:46,750
medical production why don't we allow

1016
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,909
them to get their product whatever

1017
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,550
excess they have after they take care of

1018
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:53,349
their patients into the system again if

1019
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,950
you want to deal with diversion this is

1020
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,949
the way to do it

1021
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,880
so the last thing I want to bring up to

1022
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,530
you is I think is something that we've

1023
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,420
heard from some of the discussions this

1024
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,510
morning and why it's so important we

1025
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,760
need to ensure that we maintain the

1026
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,890
continuity that we have today with the

1027
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,530
growers from yesterday that are here now

1028
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:18,539
in multiple generations we cannot let

1029
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,790
them fall off the wayside because they

1030
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:23,190
don't have the capital to compete I'm

1031
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:24,449
looking for ways that we can do that and

1032
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,300
I think there's a couple things that we

1033
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:29,549
need to be stressing number one we need

1034
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,039
to have research on the attributes of

1035
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:35,280
metal coating applications that is

1036
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:37,920
something that we have we have put in

1037
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,330
place a research component and we do

1038
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,099
have the Commission that's working on

1039
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:43,199
this but I do think it's something that

1040
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,000
we need to keep in mind we can't lose

1041
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,549
track of this is one of those areas that

1042
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,940
I think that we can have another license

1043
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,950
under

1044
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,530
LCC I've talked to them briefly they

1045
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:54,239
haven't warmed up to it completely but

1046
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,730
we could have a license that allows for

1047
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,689
a rider for medical growers to actually

1048
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:02,490
be able to file with the agency or a

1049
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:04,530
particular agency could be Oregon Health

1050
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:09,229
Authority the attributes of their

1051
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:12,540
strains it's anecdotal I know it's not

1052
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:14,309
backed by scientific research but until

1053
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:16,529
the feds open that door we can't do that

1054
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:18,090
but what we can do is we can continue to

1055
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:20,010
establish what the different strains

1056
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,110
that are being grown here what there

1057
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,150
have been beneficial for and then we'll

1058
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:26,970
have that in our back pocket when we

1059
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:29,490
start seeing national research going

1060
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:31,259
we'll be all ready D marking that market

1061
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:33,989
I think the last thing that we need to

1062
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,460
do in this area is see genetics this is

1063
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:37,289
one of those areas that if you think

1064
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,809
about for those who are in the room

1065
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:42,059
think about the Graduate movie when

1066
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:45,659
William Brooks said to Dustin Hoffman

1067
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:48,929
just one word plastics but if that word

1068
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:51,089
would have been cannabis what if that

1069
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:54,449
word would have been in the application

1070
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:56,700
of how you actually make your product

1071
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:57,230
available and stronger for whatever the

1072
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:00,259
needs

1073
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:02,780
the market our sea genetics is where we

1074
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,760
have as a state because of all the work

1075
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,640
that has been done in historical

1076
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,890
perspective if we can maintain that we

1077
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:12,559
will be an exporting state of not only

1078
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:14,960
product but seeds to other parts of the

1079
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,150
world because everyone knows what the

1080
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:24,530
brand we have here is what they want to

1081
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:25,639
actually duplicate thank you all right

1082
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,570
thank you gentlemen

1083
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:28,400
I did want to make an announcement

1084
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:31,070
because I have been told that we have

1085
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,849
got the a/c the way that we got the AC

1086
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:35,838
blasting so uh we're cooling it off in

1087
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,030
here because it got a little hot they've

1088
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,279
got time for one maybe two questions for

1089
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,750
in Gaia if you can flag them down not

1090
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,720
question for me but a question for the

1091
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:47,739
panel oh I have a question I know that

1092
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,939
Germany or rather Canada is exporting

1093
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:52,039
medical cannabis to Germany and other

1094
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,300
countries right now do you think Oregon

1095
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,039
or some of these West Coast states could

1096
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,510
get involved in international cannabis

1097
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:02,929
exporting as well or you try to keep it

1098
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:04,700
just on a national level on the

1099
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:06,199
international market we keep we can beat

1100
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,059
Canada are weeds way better there's no

1101
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:10,639
doubt that we can but there are sisters

1102
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:13,489
to remember as the Cascadia region we

1103
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,960
want to be all-inclusive but the reality

1104
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:16,279
is we are not going to be able to do

1105
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,679
that until we have movement on the

1106
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,540
federal side until they actually in this

1107
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,368
as part of the interstate commerce and

1108
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:23,599
when we talk about interstate commerce

1109
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:26,030
we actually are talking not only

1110
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,559
Interstate within the US but

1111
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,720
internationally because once that

1112
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:33,588
happens the doors open is Canada and

1113
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:35,598
Germany has already shown us quick it's

1114
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:37,429
like a group of questions but now I know

1115
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,859
they don't have time forums but the main

1116
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:42,078
part about it is as a very as a small

1117
00:41:39,858 --> 00:41:43,578
recreational grower that's gone through

1118
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,200
all the hoops and spent all the money

1119
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:48,079
and and we're the ones being hit the

1120
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,549
hardest in this industry do you guys are

1121
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,130
you looking at the implications of

1122
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,260
allowing us to be cross bordering with

1123
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:56,000
California which has so much money and

1124
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,849
so much size and so much different

1125
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,338
regulations I just see that that's going

1126
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:03,500
to destroy our small growers including

1127
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:05,389
also discussion on genetics genetics

1128
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,980
should be open if genetics are protected

1129
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,379
Monsanto type companies are going to

1130
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,900
come in

1131
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,400
take over so I think that I mean all you

1132
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,139
guys up there are you guys thinking

1133
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,720
about the small independent growers

1134
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:17,879
we're in Oregon suffering right now with

1135
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,798
an overabundance even the 20 pound

1136
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,140
increase you're talking about allowing

1137
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:24,768
more product that's that's not been

1138
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:28,828
regulated into our very tightly over

1139
00:42:24,768 --> 00:42:30,838
populated in marketplace so just to just

1140
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:32,339
do a Jarvan thank you just suggest a

1141
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,380
piece of that in terms of opening

1142
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:36,268
borders obviously if we can export your

1143
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,269
opening borders for for product to come

1144
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:40,649
in but at this moment it would not be a

1145
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:42,659
really good business decision for almost

1146
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,119
anyone to send cannabis in the Oregon

1147
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:47,308
right I mean you can you can smuggle

1148
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,778
cocaine into Bolivia if you want but it

1149
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:51,180
loses a lot of its value when it gets

1150
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:53,369
there right and so it's the same we're

1151
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:55,739
in that by the time we get to a point

1152
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:57,509
where somebody wants to send cannabis in

1153
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,788
here for commercial reasons it'll mean

1154
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:01,588
that we've stabilized our prices right

1155
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:03,630
and so we need to get there first before

1156
00:43:01,588 --> 00:43:05,219
we worry about you know California

1157
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,140
California and Oregon are both obviously

1158
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:08,429
going to be export states to the extent

1159
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:10,318
that we can work with each other to

1160
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:11,639
break a hole in that wall and I met with

1161
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,259
the same folks from California that

1162
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,429
Senator presents came out with the rural

1163
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:16,318
counties and they're really interested

1164
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:18,419
in this if we can work together to do

1165
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,849
that then we can set a precedent and we

1166
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,369
can all get it out so let me also follow

1167
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:25,470
up for the small recreational growers

1168
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:27,420
you have a product I assume that you are

1169
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,429
very proud of in the strains that you do

1170
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,798
guess what the people on the other side

1171
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:34,139
of the borders want that product because

1172
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:36,809
it's it's been regulated it's been

1173
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:38,489
tested and you've got quality product as

1174
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:40,650
compared to someone else that's why I

1175
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:42,568
think the small businesses will in fact

1176
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,519
be able to compete here I actually think

1177
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:47,730
it's the Lifeline as compared to having

1178
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:49,409
this market flood by everyone now on the

1179
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,909
genetics to me the part is very

1180
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:52,739
important you're correct it needs to be

1181
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:54,690
open what we don't want to see is the

1182
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:56,848
mass farmer or whoever else come in here

1183
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,200
and take control how else are we gonna

1184
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:00,750
do that if we don't have our own

1185
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,699
research happening here in ensuring that

1186
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,099
we have that viability for our small

1187
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:07,078
businesses and again once we have that

1188
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,359
research out I'll just name out one

1189
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,778
person Seth Crawford who gave us a lot

1190
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,278
of testimony back in 2015 and 2016 he

1191
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:16,619
and his brother have been working on

1192
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:17,309
genetics outside on their farm and

1193
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,400
outside

1194
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:22,650
corvallis and they're into stuff that I

1195
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,329
mean it's a well it's above my head

1196
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:26,160
let's just say that and it's just

1197
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:28,759
amazing of what they're looking at and

1198
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,440
as we know how many canards padorin

1199
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,800
marijuana that have not been researched

1200
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,269
have not been identified and it seems

1201
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,190
important to me that we have that type

1202
00:44:36,269 --> 00:44:40,769
of research being done sanctioned within

1203
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:43,019
the state so we can have our state to be

1204
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:46,230
a medical research as well as just a

1205
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:48,780
seed generating research facility that

1206
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:52,800
people come to Oregon to find out what's

1207
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:55,350
best thank you let's hear it again for

1208
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:00,510
Anthony the entire panel that was great

1209
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:04,489
was in depth there's a lot of a lot of

1210
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:04,490
stuff happening it's it's kind of
