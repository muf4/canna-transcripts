legalization it's going to be a bumpy

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,519
ride for you all um coming from Canada

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,840
we've watched the industry explode and

30
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,839
implode and come back a little bit so

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,600
we're here to talk a little bit today

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,478
about the foundation of a cannabis

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,919
really which I think is medical I think

34
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,078
that the medical products that we're

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,439
going to talk about today are a big part

36
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:28,478
of what is driven uh the history of the

37
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,359
you know prohibition of cannabis and the

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,719
reemergence over over the the years so

39
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,759
my name is Dwayne and uh we run a

40
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,438
company that does tping uh klock

41
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,239
Naturals and we also focus on medical

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:43,118
products through our Wellness brand and

43
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,280
in 2022 we won the world CBD awards for

44
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,959
the best CBD edible and we did that

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,519
because we wanted to put up our products

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,399
against the world and made sure they

47
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,199
were good and here at ICBC I'm excited

48
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,399
to announce uh that we've just completed

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,079
a landmark observational study with Zen

50
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,879
Trilla showcasing the difference between

51
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:05,118
our product CBD gummy with 50 Mig of CBD

52
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,199
in it versus a capsule with 50 Mig of

53
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,118
CBD in it and we found that we had over

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,878
300% more efficacy and over 500% more

55
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:13,680
efficacy with women and it's those kinds

56
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,399
of studies that have driven the interest

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
in this panel here today and we want to

58
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,280
talk a little bit about uh where we've

59
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,359
come from why we do it what what

60
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,640
everything's all about so to the panel

61
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,319
members take a moment and introduce

62
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,439
yourself uh and tell me what is the

63
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:26,238
thing that you go to Dem munch on when

64
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,719
you

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,878
consume when you consume when I ever

66
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,039
consumed I but in general I have a munch

67
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:36,120
on chocolate but that's that's that's a

68
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:39,199
known thing for they always say it's

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,920
something for women but in in your study

70
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,878
but there is a different the difference

71
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,679
between male and female you know that

72
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,399
sometimes Fades when especially with me

73
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,159
when it's about chocolate charling

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
you've been in the industry forever tell

75
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:53,598
us what you do at bedan sorry tell us

76
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,518
what you what you do at bedro can oh so

77
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,839
many things

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,080
um what we actually do is making

79
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,959
basically a raw pharmaceutical material

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,040
in very distinct five distinct

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,199
varieties that are genetically stable

82
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,639
that are chemically stable and that can

83
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,798
be used for uh that can be used to make

84
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:19,158
products out of it we don't do that

85
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,480
ourselves we cooperate with industry

86
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,919
Partners here in Europe and we have a

87
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,280
strict pharmaceutical focus on in that

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,479
crating again

89
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,199
so basically in in in that's what we do

90
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,039
and that's where we are coming from and

91
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,679
uh what we have been doing for now

92
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,079
almost 20 years in this way yeah and

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,319
when did you start at cannabis that's a

94
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,879
long time ago 32 years 32 years the real

95
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,560
Pioneer here want to make sure everybody

96
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:47,120
knows that Michael how are you today um

97
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,280
you what need did you first see in the

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,920
marketplace that inspired you to do what

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,158
you do uh so I I can't hold a candle to

100
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,839
that to uh 32 years um I've been in

101
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,399
cannabis for only about 6 years I was in

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,920
uh government senior government for a

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,519
long time before that and uh probably

104
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,318
should have used more cannabis than when

105
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,200
I was in there uh in there my um my

106
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,639
company remedes in Canada we make uh the

107
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,759
equivalent to an asthma inhaler and what

108
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,798
I saw was uh a need for a device that

109
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,079
was not only accurate but acted really

110
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,599
quickly um and it has purified THC or we

111
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,519
can customize the product in there and

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,720
and it it works really really well um

113
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,439
the challenge with it is is fitting that

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,320
Niche that we we saw of having something

115
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,360
that could work really quickly gold

116
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:39,038
standard being smoke and also um having

117
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,160
an accurate dosing which people want

118
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:43,599
awesome and what's your go-to

119
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,560
munchie sorry what's your go-to munchie

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,639
when you consume everybody's got to get

121
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,280
the munchies yeah um I kind of sleep

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,478
through those I think use the night fair

123
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,638
enough Kevin from abstract how are you

124
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,439
doing today great I saw the booth you

125
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,879
guys looked active smelled great one of

126
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,800
the smelling boo thank you all everybody

127
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,000
should

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,918
go so what role do you think technology

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,240
plays in differentiating uh product

130
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,519
offerings in such a competitive cannabis

131
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,918
Market yeah I got to I got to tip my hat

132
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:20,478
to Marcus he kind of did a a good bang

133
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,279
up job for me um but we uh we invested

134
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,038
heavily into analytics and that's what

135
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:29,719
Marcus was showing there he uh we were

136
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,680
able to invest in analytics it came out

137
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,800
to be like 100 to a thousand times more

138
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,079
powerful than your regular QC

139
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,360
instrumentation that you see in the

140
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,560
States today and that enables us to do

141
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,400
Discovery into the plant and that

142
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,720
enables us to see like 500 different

143
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,399
compounds in each sample and then when

144
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,759
we do that Discovery it enables us to

145
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,719
answer a lot of questions like what

146
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,360
happens when it sits on the Shelf what

147
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
makes cannabis gassy what makes it

148
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,720
exotic and when we answer those

149
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,199
questions we're able to create IP and by

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
extension enables us to be an R&amp;D

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
partner

152
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,359
and an innovation partner to our

153
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,598
customers and that enables us to in turn

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
make better

155
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,759
products and and do you find that tpin

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,160
are are playing a driving role um even

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,879
in um products that are meant to be

158
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,160
single

159
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,639
cannaboids well the Turpin is kind of

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,280
like a collo term right it's really you

161
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
know once you dig in there it's a lot

162
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,959
more than just tpes you got the thols

163
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
and the endals and the Esters and

164
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,159
everything else Under the Sun in there

165
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,359
and I think it's just a term to describe

166
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,599
the experience the flavor and Aroma of

167
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,240
cannabis you know what do you taste when

168
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,159
you are experiencing that product

169
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,038
awesome brender the end there how are

170
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,000
you excellent you know it's always going

171
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,079
to be at the uh tail end and wake

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,478
everybody up here how's everyone feeling

173
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:53,879
good there you go come

174
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:57,000
on brender you guys are a very research

175
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,839
focused um your your company produces a

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,319
CBD for inputs uh around the world um

177
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,598
tell us a little bit more about the

178
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,280
clinical trials that you do uh as a

179
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,079
prerequisite to product release is is

180
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,959
that an important part of the

181
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,758
development um I think you got to think

182
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,478
about the pathway of the product um is

183
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,199
it a prerequisite for all products

184
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,199
clinical trials no because you have uh a

185
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,360
pathway of of medical products that

186
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,160
don't need clinical trials but there are

187
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,280
limitations so uh if you're looking at

188
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,960
uh dosing levels and giving confidence

189
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,038
to Physicians you do need the clinical

190
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,318
backing and if you want to go through a

191
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,598
clinical prog program um you you do have

192
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,560
to have clinical background if you're

193
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:38,120
looking at acute pain versus chronic

194
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,280
pain uh faster onset versus slow set so

195
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,720
depending on the product form depending

196
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,359
on medical uh versus pharmaceutical drug

197
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
no so the medical pathway no you don't

198
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,240
need clinical uh trials for that but if

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,159
you want RS drugs if you want more

200
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,918
champions in the medical community GPS

201
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,279
pharmaceutical industry to get involved

202
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,478
then yes it is Paramount importantly to

203
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,158
have clinical backing and do you think

204
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,120
that observational studies um have a

205
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,439
place in that process they have carry

206
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,478
enough weight uh behind them for the

207
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,680
pharmaceutical and Medical Market versus

208
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:09,719
pure clinical Phase 1 phase two trials

209
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,199
if we want to if we want to attract the

210
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,039
pharmaceutical industry then we got to

211
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,680
do the full gamut and I think sometimes

212
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,719
within this industry I think uh there's

213
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,720
some myths and false assumptions that

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,199
just because it's u a natural

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
plant-based substance that Regulators

216
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,478
are going to take a bit of a break or

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,199
faster pathway um and and that's not

218
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,120
true because you know if you if you want

219
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,680
to follow the biotech and Pharma um

220
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
Pathways it's written in law and

221
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:39,278
Regulation and you have to do the full

222
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,719
full gamut to to get there go ahead yeah

223
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,720
I I want to jump in here I totally agree

224
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,040
with what you say the the the however I

225
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,440
do think cannabis is a very specific

226
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,199
product when and it's a natural plant

227
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,800
and everybody's talking about

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,600
cannabinoids as of cannabinoids as being

229
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,319
the main component and that needs to be

230
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,519
researched properly I know that doctors

231
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,959
and scientists are doing that quite a

232
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,159
lot I think however that the value lies

233
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,639
in the whole plant I think that the

234
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,719
value lies in standardization of a whole

235
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,919
plant have specific very specific

236
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,278
chemical varieties that you can actually

237
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,759
research and that is consistent for the

238
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:19,559
next time when the researcher come backs

239
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,480
and has to do other research but with

240
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:26,399
the same product so making that possible

241
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,000
and working towards products in the

242
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
pharmaceutical industry they have to

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,839
take one hoop

244
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,120
meaning they have to go off the single

245
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,560
compound Theory single Target single

246
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,720
compound Theory and they have to accept

247
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,599
a whole plant but a standardized whole

248
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,600
plant as a as a way to go I think if we

249
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,200
can achieve that then cannabis will will

250
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,240
get to the right place where it belongs

251
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
it's cannabis is not only THC if it was

252
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,120
that then products would already have

253
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,600
been long into the market but the

254
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,679
research should focus up whole plant

255
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,480
product to my mind

256
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:05,039
and add that that there's many Pathways

257
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,959
and and I agree cannaboid research and

258
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,039
isolating is just a pathway we've chosen

259
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,679
uh to get there and following what

260
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,000
Regulators want to see if you look at

261
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,919
the market authorization drugs it's all

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,679
from isolated products so but I agree

263
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,199
this is what needs to be done more

264
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:19,399
Innovation the more we study the whole

265
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,839
plant the more products will be out

266
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,759
there uh this is just the pathway that

267
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,920
we've chosen it's amazing watching the

268
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,838
Cannabis Pioneer fight the political

269
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,360
activist at the end there or may an

270
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,480
activist who you know youve got a lot of

271
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,560
polit politics in your background um and

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,360
it's interesting you know your comment

273
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,838
about if we want to attract Pharma well

274
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,120
do we I mean do we want to attract

275
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,160
patients and I think that's part of the

276
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,320
challenge

277
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:44,639
of if we look at the world of patients I

278
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,959
think currently if you see at a global

279
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,839
level it's about 10% of the doctors that

280
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,719
are willing to prescribe 90% is not yet

281
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
there and needs clinical research and I

282
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,200
agree we need to do clinical research on

283
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,200
every level but that 90% of people that

284
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,560
we cannot reach that can have that can

285
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,639
profit from Cannabis as a medicine that

286
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,319
is the 90% you have to reach through a

287
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,120
pharmaceutical approach and I couldn't

288
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,440
agree more uh to that than that it's

289
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,360
well let's talk about this a good segue

290
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,800
into safety um you know let's talk a

291
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,320
little bit about safety you know what

292
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,240
role does safety and quality control

293
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
play uh in the product development that

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,480
your company does and how do you support

295
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,680
safety and mic will start with you yeah

296
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,959
so a product like Irish Wayne um the the

297
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,919
QA and the QC on it's really it's built

298
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:35,119
like a drug product um we follow the

299
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,919
international I guidelines for how you'd

300
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,480
make a medical device like an inhaler um

301
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,919
so it's tested all the way through front

302
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,680
end back end so we make the product to

303
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,679
GMP criteria simply because it's it's

304
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,719
going to evolve that way um even though

305
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,759
in Canada the way the licensing works is

306
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,879
a little bit different globally it's

307
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,519
going to be a GMP product so it's going

308
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,480
to be a cannabis medicine this you know

309
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,480
we just had a great talk earlier on the

310
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,440
confusion of how every country country

311
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,920
sets up those own their own rules and

312
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,959
regulations um the closer we can get to

313
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,519
those standards those GMP standards it's

314
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,000
going to be easier for everybody to

315
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,240
understand the product and for it to

316
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,159
move around fa enough Kevin what do you

317
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,000
think yeah someone said something

318
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,799
earlier where when you enter the

319
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,159
industry or when the industry starts up

320
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,000
the barriers to entry are usually lower

321
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,480
and as it progresses and matures those

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,320
barriers get much higher and in

323
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,000
California you know QA and QC are huge

324
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,839
those things are starting to be adapted

325
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,839
especi they're already adapted by

326
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,160
majority of the Canadian LPS and the US

327
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,160
companies are catching up to that but

328
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,198
further on that you have the regulatory

329
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,120
packets that you have to be completely

330
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:45,879
ready for I'm sure you know all about

331
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,799
that and then also toxicology is a big

332
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,799
one that's getting a whole lot of

333
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,399
investment now and uh you know when you

334
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,120
start off in the industry you know ISO

335
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,120
might cut it but not anymore you have to

336
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:01,600
go to sqf 23 GMP and you have to go

337
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,519
through the whole gamut no brinder sure

338
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,519
I think safety is Paramount to give

339
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,519
consumers patients confidence that the

340
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,839
products they are consuming are safe and

341
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,039
reliable and the stigma still exists in

342
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,519
this industry as we all know and there's

343
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,958
industry hasn't helped itself where they

344
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,959
put products out there that has a lot of

345
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,799
band substance in it but the approach

346
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,198
we've taken uh to assist safety I think

347
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,278
it starts with your manufacturing as

348
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:25,559
been mentioned uh your toxicology and

349
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,278
also the safety profiles are two things

350
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,719
that were Paramount when we look at

351
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,078
novel Foods in Europe uh that they want

352
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,320
to see and one of the things that we

353
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,359
done as a company uh to your question

354
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,879
Dwayne was we provided our own data uh

355
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,079
when we uh did applications rather than

356
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,559
relying on third party data so all the

357
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:46,439
data in our submissions is is is from

358
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:48,439
our own um manufacturing our own

359
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,560
molecules to put that forward in our

360
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,600
facility and I think that is Paramount

361
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,000
if we want to build confidence uh

362
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,440
amongst consumers and patients uh uh and

363
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,320
attract more

364
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,000
people better can was first company that

365
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,399
became GMP licensed back in very early

366
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,360
2017 um I think the GMP should go to the

367
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,600
level of cultivation that's where it all

368
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,278
starts um actually the Dutch government

369
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,680
went with us in the beginning saying we

370
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,399
include cultivation the way you do it as

371
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,879
part of your GMP license later on they

372
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:26,198
said n difficult cannot be it should G

373
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,480
should be gcp anyway it's not possible

374
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:33,120
um however what we have been doing as a

375
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,680
company is we implemented GMP in our

376
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,560
gcp

377
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,758
manuals and made it gmcp as we call it

378
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,479
you're making up your own acronyms I

379
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,199
love it exactly perfect well know flow

380
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,639
scientific um you know our tpine company

381
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,958
we constantly are being asked to include

382
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,879
new molecules you know in different

383
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,278
formulations and you know we revert to

384
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,039
the best available safety data um and

385
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,278
provider don't provide them and then you

386
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,559
know we get complaints well your

387
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,519
product's more expensive we're like yeah

388
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,758
it's not being cut with questionable

389
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,240
products which we've seen from some uh

390
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,879
some some providers and it often it's

391
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,839
the effect of the marketplace especially

392
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,838
on the rec side or the adult use you

393
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,759
know trying to push the boundaries and

394
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,399
and gain market share and you know on

395
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,879
the medical side you know fortunately I

396
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,159
don't see that happening do you think

397
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:23,198
that wreck um pushes

398
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,879
medical the other way around I would say

399
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,439
that's that's and it's a bit of a shame

400
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,559
to me I would say that wreck is Rec

401
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,680
should be w

402
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,479
and medical should be medical and the

403
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,638
overlap between the two um it's a kind

404
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,278
of a little bit heartbreaking especially

405
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,959
when I'm I'm trying to convince doctors

406
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,278
I'm we as a company are trying to

407
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,359
convince doctors that you can use

408
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,639
cannabis the right way for patients and

409
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,318
then the doctor is pointing to the

410
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,720
medical world or to the recreational

411
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:52,879
world and say look what's what's

412
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,440
happening there and they are looking to

413
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,078
what is happening in Germany right now

414
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,920
there's there's some sort of a gray

415
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,479
overlap between medical and recreational

416
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,039
and doctors they they they shift away

417
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,959
from it you know they they don't want to

418
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,360
be they don't want to

419
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,000
be they want don't want to be there and

420
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,759
they want they want to don't want to be

421
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,720
mentioned that way so again I think it's

422
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
fair fair enough to say recreational

423
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,440
World create your own world I'm fine

424
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,360
with that you know no problem on that

425
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,440
side but don't mingle with the world of

426
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,879
patience to that regard you know there

427
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,480
is two big group that that has is in

428
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,679
need of cannabis for many ways don't

429
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,920
tell he Canada that I know

430
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,359
yeah I I think the medical and wreck are

431
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,919
very different like from my experience

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,240
in Canada when rck came in we had um

433
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,879
hundreds of thousands of patients with

434
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,278
medical documents and it plummeted and

435
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,240
and what we see is um when I used to be

436
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,159
involved in executive side in healthcare

437
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,079
until you convince the the person that

438
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:53,559
holds the pen that's writing the script

439
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,120
um you know you need to have the quality

440
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,879
to tie all this together between the QC

441
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,959
the QA the label we didn't talk about

442
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,120
the label like a on the medical side um

443
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,399
the label is so important because when a

444
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,480
doctor writes a script they don't

445
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,798
question the label they assume it's

446
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,919
right and and they they live in a world

447
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:14,078
where if if the cancer drug says X they

448
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,880
assume that's right and we need to get

449
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,159
to that standard on the medical side and

450
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,319
then the the clinical and observational

451
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,120
you asked a question on I think

452
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,519
observational work is so important and

453
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,279
and we have such a an interesting

454
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,558
opportunity because cannabis itself has

455
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:34,200
notice of compliance to use a a phma

456
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,599
term and it's in the industry in Canada

457
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,880
several places in the United States and

458
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,558
now coming into Europe we can do

459
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,520
observational work that you can't do

460
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,160
with an API in the drug side where you

461
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,599
have to go through quality safety firm

462
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,798
talks and everything so it'll come down

463
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,439
to how smart we can be in this room

464
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,798
about asking the right questions on the

465
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,558
observational work convincing the white

466
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:57,119
coats in our world this does work and I

467
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,960
think they're almost there um Rec is

468
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,599
going to create amazing opportunities

469
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,200
and amazing challenges at the same time

470
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,519
because our physicians will um Michael

471
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,679
will go across the street and just go

472
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,798
pick it out yourself I don't want to

473
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,600
carry the

474
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,759
liability um so it I think we're going

475
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,199
to learn a lot as we go rapidly through

476
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,279
this from decriminalizing and bringing

477
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,000
in this amazing oil that can help so

478
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,678
many people brid I didn't want to forget

479
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,558
to have you pitch your keynote tomorrow

480
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,840
what what are you going to be talking

481
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,759
about tomorrow morning uh tomorrow

482
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,959
morning we talking about advancing the

483
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,919
anoid scientific landscape what are the

484
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,679
challenges what's a course what are the

485
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,799
rewards uh what's on the horizon in

486
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,200
terms of innovation that's happening uh

487
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,119
within the industry and uh I've been

488
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,960
told by the organizers it's going to be

489
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,319
the highlight of the conference um so

490
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,159
it's a must attend 10: a.m. tomorrow uh

491
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,038
brought your own fluffers did you I was

492
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,320
just passing on information I've been

493
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,519
told Dwayne perfect speaking the truth

494
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,158
at the end of the panel there um Kevin

495
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,960
uh tpin are and flavors and Esters and

496
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:00,440
ethal as you pointed out are always

497
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,840
Making Waves uh in product development

498
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,720
in North America I'm certainly seeing

499
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,879
that in Canada as being one of the key

500
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,120
differentiators of how products are uh

501
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,720
made to appear different from their

502
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,959
competitive products what future Trends

503
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,120
do you foresee in cannabis product

504
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,400
design uh over the next few

505
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,158
years um well specifically in Germany

506
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,519
we'll see how like the medical Market

507
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,240
develops here I'm I'm specifically very

508
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,839
interested in seeing how that develops

509
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,519
and how the recreational Market develops

510
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:31,119
and if there is going to be a diverg

511
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,119
between the medical and the recreational

512
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,678
or if it's just going to like gray

513
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,239
together essentially into like people

514
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,919
releasing the same product in both

515
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,798
markets and that's what we see in

516
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,280
California and you know you see every

517
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,798
product Under the Sun is what it seems

518
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,000
like when you walk into a California

519
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,158
dispensary and I'm wondering if that's

520
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,240
the same thing that's going to happen

521
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,720
here in Germany and so that's you know

522
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,200
it's a lot of speculation in that

523
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,360
question yeah it seems in phase one that

524
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,120
we're not going to even see the ability

525
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,199
to sell or buy cannabis here Germany

526
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,038
phase that's going to be phase two or

527
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,840
pillar two as I've as I've heard this

528
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:05,240
weekend but in Canada you know we've

529
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,519
certainly Blended that you know your

530
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,440
comment Michael about it you can just go

531
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,359
across the street and pick it out

532
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,880
yourself the the challenge with that

533
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,959
process at least in Canada has been that

534
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,960
the Arbiter of what's available in wreck

535
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,400
um is individual people that are part of

536
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,759
the monopolies that actually control

537
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,559
distribution meaning the provincial

538
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,400
governments and and I hope that doesn't

539
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,879
happen here for Germany it be the main

540
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,798
thing I'd recommend they do not do um

541
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,720
but as far as the ability for medical to

542
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,558
access greater product selection that

543
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,679
are actually effective um I think

544
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,639
medical does a better job of that um

545
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,360
that we can have the opportunity to

546
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,320
produce products that that hit a very

547
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,439
specific outcome um you know whether

548
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,319
it's in in female Health uh whether it's

549
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,120
in relaxation stress or you know pain

550
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,639
control you know Charlie how do you how

551
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,239
do you think that's going to be unfolded

552
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,799
here in

553
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,359
Germany it's very difficult to predict

554
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,679
how things are going to look like what I

555
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,199
do know however is that if people want

556
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,320
to use cannabis for a specific purpose

557
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,279
in their

558
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:02,000
health um most of those people like to

559
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,678
stick to the brand or to the product

560
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,400
that they get I see a problem in

561
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,679
recreational type of production that uh

562
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,038
especially when it comes to flour or

563
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,960
flower product that it will be difficult

564
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,640
to maintain those products for a longer

565
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,079
time in the market because they will be

566
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,278
replaced by other types and other other

567
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,918
things and then it will be difficult for

568
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,519
that it will be difficult for that

569
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:30,159
specific group to find and to stick to a

570
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:34,158
product that is always there and

571
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:37,880
I of course when you start uh working

572
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,520
product into uh other products and and

573
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,000
it will be it might become a little bit

574
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,400
better um but again flour is still one

575
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,079
of the biggest products in the market

576
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,919
and is there to stay um even in Canada

577
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,199
with a with a wide selection of product

578
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,320
formats you know Edibles topicals uh you

579
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,960
know Vapes Etc canab flow is still you

580
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,278
know 70% of the market and then

581
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,278
pre-rolls are another you know 20% of

582
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,200
the market so you know there's 10 or 15%

583
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,278
of the market that's being used by

584
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,798
non-flower you know I'm I'm putting

585
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:08,960
pre-roll into that flower category um

586
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:10,319
you know and one of the things that

587
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,200
you've done over the years you know

588
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,200
Ching is if you've had to move your

589
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,120
business around to support regulatory

590
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,919
changes um you know how do regulations

591
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,199
affect where you operate very much

592
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,880
Regulatory Compliance is actually one of

593
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,120
the the first commitments we have in our

594
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,039
company um so we have been bound to the

595
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,839
Netherland for a long time we have been

596
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,759
in Canada when the rules were changing

597
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,199
in Canada we have been there for a bit

598
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,200
um but when we saw the mix of

599
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,200
recreational and medical arise again in

600
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,558
Canada things started to become diff

601
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,720
difficult for us let me put it that way

602
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,558
um in Europe we see a change now there

603
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,919
are more countries coming online with

604
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,879
regulatory friendly environments for

605
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,840
production and actually it's the reason

606
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,240
why we are moving to Denmark as we speak

607
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,759
um plants are moving this month so we

608
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,519
hope to be online in Denmark by the end

609
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:09,359
of this year um and to have more

610
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,918
regulatory Freedom so to speak uh we see

611
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:15,038
it's a patchwork in Europe still of

612
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:18,080
regulations and yeah we have to adapt to

613
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:21,440
those to that patwork kind of well right

614
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,480
now with Medical Market in in Germany

615
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,600
really being driven by that mag oh prep

616
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,159
I'm saying that right that that the the

617
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:30,759
pharmacy distribution um you know and

618
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,520
that really impacting the product

619
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,839
designs that we can put into the market

620
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,038
you know Michael how has that really

621
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,759
impacted your uh product Design Concepts

622
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,839
a product like ours will be a medical

623
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,440
device as I understand it in Germany so

624
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,558
it'll be treated like a drug um

625
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,440
countries in Europe uh Portugal United

626
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:48,960
Kingdom are a little bit different um

627
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,480
there's regulations around cannabis

628
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,798
medicine or integrated devices I I think

629
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,839
is it harmonizes do it'll it'll come

630
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:58,158
together and it'll be a GMP level

631
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,359
product so the to the comments that were

632
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,559
just made on the the quality assurance

633
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,759
and the label and and that's going to be

634
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,678
critical and then the regulatory aspect

635
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,359
of a product like ours it's going to be

636
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,320
highly regulated simply because it's a

637
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:14,119
device and then the quality of the API

638
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:16,200
that goes in um Germany's got a really H

639
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,839
great opportunity here from watching and

640
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,600
learning from Canada and United States

641
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:24,439
and I think the regulations um will

642
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,119
probably be great on the QA QC site

643
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,440
quality of the product will be great

644
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:31,239
it's going to be access to Market

645
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,399
Germany likes its rules well I I think

646
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,038
the quality of the product is going to

647
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:38,278
be very high we're going to see 60 70%

648
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,480
flour as it evolves and then there's

649
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:41,839
going to be other products come in did

650
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,480
you see the regulation on the screen

651
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,278
where the flower could only have 10% THC

652
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,240
was that an age gate thing or was that

653
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:51,839
meant to be across the board oh I I

654
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,558
don't know age okay all right phew cuz

655
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,439
27% cannabis in in Canada is like oh is

656
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,000
it that low um so I'm glad I don't think

657
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,000
that's going to happen here

658
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,558
so on the medical side as we develop

659
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,720
products for medical um how do you find

660
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:07,639
your motivation uh and the and the

661
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,399
reward and results of focusing on the

662
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,840
medical versus wreck how does that

663
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,359
impact your products and Bender may we

664
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:15,278
start with you on that yeah we we're

665
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,558
focused on the medical farma side and uh

666
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,558
you know don't do anything on the rec

667
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,960
side but we're Guided by the evidence

668
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,440
and the science so we we look at

669
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,519
cannaboids and see uh how they work in

670
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,480
the body how they work with the

671
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,839
receptors we we follow the science we uh

672
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,839
work with researchers around the world

673
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,199
currently we're in 30 clinical studies

674
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,038
globally that are utilizing our active

675
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,159
pharmaceutical ingredients so we're

676
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:36,640
we're Guided by the evidence we're

677
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,559
Guided by the science we're we're Guided

678
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,000
by what the researchers like the Welsh

679
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,720
paper say on on what these cannaboids

680
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,480
can do and we feel it's important to to

681
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,919
isolate them to study them and then

682
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,839
figure out how they work individually

683
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,840
and how they work in combination and

684
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,599
then put that through uh clinical

685
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:55,720
research we developing new chemical

686
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:57,038
entities also uh doing our research but

687
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,759
uh we're driven by the science we're

688
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,759
driven by the data uh terms of our

689
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,640
approach yeah couldn't agree more driven

690
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,519
by science we just opened up our own

691
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,480
Clinical Research Unit in the

692
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,759
Netherlands uh getting to a level of

693
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,440
scientific results uh that we are aiming

694
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:19,038
for with our own products with our own

695
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:23,840
flour basically um and getting those

696
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:26,278
results uh out there getting uh the uh

697
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,639
basically getting the the thumbs up from

698
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,119
um from the medical world on the way we

699
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,120
approach it is for us very rewarding

700
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,759
yet um I I um in addition to the science

701
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,839
part of it I've learned so much from the

702
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:42,558
sales data on the medical side um I got

703
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,599
into this thinking kind of naively that

704
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,480
an inhaler like we were making would be

705
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:48,480
great for people that are naive to

706
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,360
cannabis and what the sales data is

707
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,120
showing us in Canada is people that

708
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,119
smoke a lot of a can cannabis are

709
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,239
picking up an inhaler and they're doing

710
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,719
it because of anti-smoking laws that are

711
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,359
everywhere so you know most most people

712
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
that consume medical cannabis globally

713
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,599
are smoking it because that's the

714
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,640
primary format that we've had um for

715
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:09,158
years and years so I I think as it

716
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,440
evolves it's going to be a very

717
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,880
interesting product to see how people

718
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,320
evolve and continue to smoke because

719
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,399
that's the way they've taken it we know

720
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,519
in medical systems when you ask a

721
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,000
patient to stop smoking they don't and

722
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,918
that I'm not trying to shame anybody

723
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
about that it's the way they consume

724
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,520
their medicine and we're going to see

725
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,520
better products come along to help them

726
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,558
um keep their THC levels appropriate um

727
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,679
and and manage their their

728
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:37,879
indication you know Kevin do you find

729
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,559
that your consumer your your P your uh

730
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,000
clients are coming to you with

731
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,240
consumer-based demand like are you

732
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,720
seeing that uh uh the demand for product

733
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,839
development come from the the level of

734
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,558
the

735
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,199
consumer um yes more or less uh it was

736
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,359
interesting how you said how you're

737
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,480
following the science and it's very

738
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,398
objective whereas when we're developing

739
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,759
products for uh consumer Focus right

740
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,398
we're developing it for our clients or

741
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:06,919
is doing it for the consumer um our

742
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:08,918
science is a bit squishier as you know

743
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,880
it depends on the consumer's experience

744
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,278
and my experience of cherries is morally

745
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,120
different than your experience of

746
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,919
cherries and so when we analyze

747
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,839
something we you know we analyze it to

748
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,240
the nth degree all as many compounds we

749
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,119
possibly can and then we take this huge

750
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,519
sensory panel of many people to say like

751
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,479
how does that smell and taste to you

752
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,120
what does that experience to you and

753
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,480
then trying to combine these databases

754
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:36,359
together to create this robot that can

755
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,640
predict how something might be later and

756
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,719
we're using that to develop these

757
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,080
products at a larger scale for more

758
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,558
people essentially to make more custom

759
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,639
products for these consumers in the

760
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,839
marketplace you we certainly experienced

761
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,320
a klock wellness um consumers coming to

762
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,319
us you know and expressing Joy with a

763
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,960
given product and that really helps us

764
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,678
you know direct you know where we're

765
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,640
going to go next and certainly the sales

766
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,120
data is a big indicator of that we've

767
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,360
had products that have failed you know

768
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,359
products that were we think they're

769
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,479
great um but you know the consumer like

770
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:09,359
me you know in in a busy Marketplace me

771
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,720
doesn't cut it you know it's got to be

772
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,359
spectacular one way or the other can I

773
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,480
can I just quickly add to you on on that

774
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,719
thing I think uh think about products

775
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,399
too you got to think about Innovation

776
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,319
too uh in terms of uh uh Advanced thy

777
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:22,839
systems finished dosage forms how we

778
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,558
enhancing biovailability

779
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,720
solubility the stability uh on this

780
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:29,359
product and viability is a key one so I

781
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,960
think that is going to be key too and I

782
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,398
think targeted Delivery Systems is also

783
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,360
going to be key too uh as we move so

784
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,239
innovation's also going to push too in

785
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,558
terms of developing

786
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,240
products I think it's time for

787
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:43,240
questions for questions

788
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:50,159
[Music]

789
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:52,240
already's who has a

790
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,360
question okay there's one right there I

791
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,839
was going to say you were wrong it is

792
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,278
clearly not time for questions and yet

793
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,599
you were right was watching the clock

794
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:59,519
man I'm doing my job you're doing a good

795
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,678
job

796
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:07,558
hello uh we come from Morocco and we are

797
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:12,278
new to the medical uh legalization of uh

798
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:14,558
cannabis and what we see is this U uh

799
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:17,119
the medical position is to go to the

800
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:20,639
molecule while the world is looking for

801
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:23,278
the flour and we just don't understand

802
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,159
this schizophrenia between the consumer

803
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,880
that came to cannabis and heard about

804
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:32,039
cannabis and 1,000 year of reputation

805
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,360
and medicine is coming to it because of

806
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,720
the flour and now we are breaking it to

807
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:39,558
molecules and we just don't know how to

808
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,000
navigate to this because we are going to

809
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,960
extraction and the further we go into

810
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,398
extraction and the further we go from

811
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,319
the origin and we don't know whether

812
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,199
it's the molecule or it's the full

813
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:55,038
spectrum that is needed and in that case

814
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,240
if it's the full spectrum why an oil

815
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,798
full spectrum wouldn't be a medicine and

816
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,000
why a flower wouldn't be a medicine and

817
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,759
since we are

818
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,839
investing every day we get uh it's

819
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,480
getting foggier and F years so welcome

820
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,038
to cannabis the more we study the less

821
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,839
we understand is that welcome to

822
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,000
cannabis or is that welcome to like

823
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:19,240
corporate science welcome to the

824
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:23,679
regulator regulation of Canabis if I may

825
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:26,159
um what actually happened to cannabis in

826
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,200
general people found out that cannabis

827
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,559
has its medical value

828
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,679
and then all of a sudden we have to push

829
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:38,038
it into a system that we call

830
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,880
medicines and people don't understand

831
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,638
it

832
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,799
and we had lots of discussions in our

833
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,759
company as well where we actually say

834
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,558
the horse has always been behind the

835
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,000
cart you need to do your research first

836
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,158
before you bring a pharmaceutical

837
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,720
product to the market and guess what

838
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,880
cannabis is there for 60 70 80 hundred

839
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,000
years thousands years already in a

840
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,320
market where it's basically a

841
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,159
traditional medicine to that regard

842
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:08,158
however there's a very important thing

843
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,760
to cannabis because

844
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,679
cannabis is not cannabis always the same

845
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,038
you have those different products with

846
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,840
different molecules and then we're com

847
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,919
to the Turpin to the cannabinoids to

848
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:25,638
everything together there so the option

849
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,600
of picking out one molecule is for a

850
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:30,079
doctor and a pharmacist the most ideal

851
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:33,678
option it's the for them the best way to

852
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:36,839
work however history has shown that

853
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,880
whole plant for in many cases works

854
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,798
better but not this specific whole plant

855
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,240
but that whole plant so what makes that

856
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,000
difference this is where standardization

857
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,960
the chemical standardization of your

858
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,359
plan matter comes in I'm starting to

859
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,000
lecture now but I will leave it to but I

860
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,278
understand your question but there's

861
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,398
basically no real answer to it other

862
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:03,839
than look into history what happened

863
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,199
there brender yeah and I think that it's

864
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,119
an ongoing debate and we hear this all

865
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,679
the time um and I think there are many

866
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,759
Pathways and I think there's no right

867
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,639
answer it's just uh you know if you want

868
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,158
a pharmaceutical drug out there there's

869
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:16,439
a pathway to establish so what you have

870
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,120
to do and isolate molecules and if you

871
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,320
look at the uh approved Market

872
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,839
authorized drugs it's all dealing with

873
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,000
uh molecules but if you want a medical

874
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,759
pathway that's there too and I don't

875
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,240
think there's a wrong answer it's just

876
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:28,240
where your focus is and the approach

877
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,759
that you want to take I think maybe some

878
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,359
of the challenge though is that we see

879
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,319
is that the the scientific approach or

880
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,638
the pharmaceutical approach tends to

881
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,839
overshadow because there's more money

882
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:41,240
you know what I mean so it tends to

883
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,759
overshadow and they try to push the

884
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,720
plant magic out of the way well this is

885
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,359
the the tension that built one of the

886
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,720
reasons we did the study that we just

887
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,798
released yesterday to answer your

888
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,360
question sir is that you we believe that

889
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:54,319
broad spectrum uh is critically

890
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,278
important and we believe there's a

891
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,960
larger market for non-thc products all

892
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,839
of our products actually don't contain a

893
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,798
any THC but they do have CBG and CBN and

894
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,398
CBC and and CBD and tpin and what we

895
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:07,679
were able to show was that a CBD

896
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,719
isolated molecule without the additional

897
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,000
plant components was not as effective it

898
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,039
still worked but it wasn't as effective

899
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,280
so I actually take a Counterpoint that I

900
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:17,639
I actually don't think the focus on the

901
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,240
molecule by itself is the right path as

902
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,800
I think you're trying to articulate um

903
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,838
but it is unfortunately a path that can

904
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,359
be understood and brinder I think would

905
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:25,838
agree with me that that if you want you

906
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:27,480
can understand a thing you can regulate

907
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,559
a thing better and therefore you can

908
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,800
make could go forward um but that isn't

909
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,719
necessarily

910
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,919
right question up here um thank you I

911
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,519
want to follow up on the on the earlier

912
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:44,239
questions and and your uh great panel um

913
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:47,759
in this question belief versus proof um

914
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:50,678
as cannabis puts itself as a traditional

915
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,560
medicine but also very modern medical

916
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:58,358
product what modern techniques are there

917
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:01,440
to solve your problem of proving out the

918
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:03,480
the efficacy uh that traditional medical

919
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,720
trials can't do and maybe more

920
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,159
complicated modern data analytics might

921
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,000
be so what techniques would you see in

922
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,279
the future the specific technique that

923
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,320
we use with a company called zentella I

924
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,200
encourage you to look them up is they

925
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,280
used an AI um based algorithm that was

926
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:22,279
analyzing EEG data so we actually put an

927
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,640
EEG on people's heads have them consume

928
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,720
the product and then compare the results

929
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,559
between uh their pre-consumption state

930
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,000
their postc consumption State and the

931
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,119
states they achieve between the two

932
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,679
products over two different sessions um

933
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,559
and so that's a good example of taking

934
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,919
new technology and it's non-invasive um

935
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,480
and that can be observed it can be done

936
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,039
fairly quickly it can be done with with

937
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,880
some economic viability uh and is a good

938
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:45,759
use of artificial intelligence and I

939
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,240
know we had a great AI chat just before

940
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,880
this but gentlemen what else are you

941
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,879
seeing done as far as modern techniques

942
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,640
to resolve that question I think we're

943
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,119
looking at the efficiency how you could

944
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,159
do clinical processes more efficient cuz

945
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,480
right now you're looking at uh a billion

946
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,159
dollars in 10 years uh to to to do a

947
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,358
full trial but you know how you can do

948
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,598
your inv Vivo and vitro and and and uh

949
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:05,598
look at some of those signals there if

950
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,559
you're not getting a thing cut your

951
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,960
losses and and move on some of the

952
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:10,838
innovative ways that you can you can do

953
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,440
that work with cro work working with

954
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:16,480
iqvia and how we can do these more

955
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,119
efficiently uh to to move ahead but I

956
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,960
think the key thing for us is that if

957
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,160
you're not getting the signals earlier

958
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,880
you got to go find a new Direction and

959
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,078
move on and then don't fog a dead horse

960
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,358
the other thing I've seen that I think

961
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,760
works well is a joint together you know

962
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:32,400
cooperatives that have an outcome that

963
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,800
that benefits everyone you know you're

964
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,440
seeing that a little bit with the novel

965
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,119
Foods groups you know the novel Foods

966
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,800
people are getting together to say you

967
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,440
want this data well let's all get the

968
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,240
data it's going to be the same data and

969
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,519
then get the regulator to try to approve

970
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,639
that but share the cost divided by 30

971
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,800
instead of divided by one um I mean

972
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,279
that's maybe not that Innovative an idea

973
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,400
but in a very highly competitive

974
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,519
environment I think it's

975
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,119
rare that's a good point more

976
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:01,239
questions feels like the show all right

977
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,280
we're on time thank you very much thank

978
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:04,279
you very much let's hear it

979
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,759
again well done
