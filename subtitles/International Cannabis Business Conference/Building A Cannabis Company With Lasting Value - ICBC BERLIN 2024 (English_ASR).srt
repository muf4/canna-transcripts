R hello Ling on thank you so much and

18
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:52,878
God you should know me better by now

19
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,439
I've done so many of these panels that

20
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:59,039
you would think you'd know my Intro by

21
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,320
better oh don't get me singing with you

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
anyways thank you so much much for

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,760
coming this is a very important panel

24
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,280
I've done a few different panels but

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,680
truly I believe this is one of the most

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,439
important panels that I've been a part

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,400
of because it's about scaling your

28
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,839
business and scaling your business is so

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,200
important and as I was explaining to

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,079
someone why they want to come to this

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,359
this uh 450 show instead of going to

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,640
smoke at 420 thank you by the way for

33
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,560
coming back uh is that if you have a

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,159
business and you don't think about

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,640
scaling it's literally just a job if

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
you're lucky you'll make $100,000 $150

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,599
$200,000 you know you know that and

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,158
that's not bad at all but it's barely a

39
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,438
business a real business is scalable and

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,079
looks to the international market to

41
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,599
make a lot a lot of money I mean and

42
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:42,959
that's what I think about business and

43
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,759
that's what a lot of ICBC people want to

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,199
know about so I'm here with these

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,680

myself and a team of 16 uh and in the

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,040
past uh scaling wise I've worked with a

90
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,560
lot of the largest companies throughout

91
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,158
North America uh that have scaled both

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
successfully and

93
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,280
unsuccessfully uh and got to see what

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,480
worked and what hasn't uh and was able

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840
to grow my first consulting firm and

96
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,438
sell it to one of the big msos uh so

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
we're we're scaling and growing again

98
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,759
now all right very cool Round of

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
Applause for these awesome panelists so

100
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,878
we're very lucky to have such experience

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,199
on the stage with us and I'm Alex revich

102
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,639
uh I helped the first ICBC back in 2017

103
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,238
uh it's so amazing to see how big it's

104
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,199
grown uh and been coming back every year

105
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,400
uh I'm in Canada my day job when I'm not

106
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,079
doing ICBC is I have luch Brands we in

107
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
Edibles contract manufacturer with about

108
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,720
80 products in the market and I have a

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,639
pharmacy called hybrid Farm which has

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,680
medical cannabis and pharmaceutical so

111
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,519
that's me and uh really excited to do

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,840
this topic with you all and I never

113
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,319
really like to start with anything

114
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,599
negative at the beginning of of a panel

115
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,599
but people were really asking me a lot

116
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,800
about you know why this is so important

117
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,759
this panel and we talked about all these

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
crazy negative stories of what people

119
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,319
have done in the past so we're laughing

120
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,679
backstage about some of these examples

121
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,800
of these people who have done bad

122
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,680
scaling whether scale too fast scale too

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,520
slow so maybe let's start with a few

124
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,840
examples of why this is such an

125
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,639
important topic to give an example of

126
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,198
who's what kind of disaster can happen

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,759
if you don't plan for

128
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,560
scaling um so I think Canada is riddled

129
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,319
with example uh you have to know that

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,519
95% of companies in Canada are not

131
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,680
profitable uh you know selling at a loss

132
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,959
is definitely not something anybody

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,120
should be striving for and of course all

134
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,719
your favorite names are there orora

135
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,160
canopy ta Ray EXO all the big ones uh we

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,280
firmly believe that none of those

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,000
scaling up were good I mean a lot of

138
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,638
those company at first has at uh had a

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,759
mandate of scaling as fast as possible

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,720
and we'll see later what we do with it

141
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,280
while you saw happen most of those

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,520
companies don't even grow in Canada

143
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:38,079
anymore they now contract

144
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,159
grow yeah I've I've seen in in the

145
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,038
states and you're talk you're looking at

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,240
a person that's been in hundreds of

147
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,439
grows um you go in hey I've got this

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,600
great plan I'm going to I'm going to do

149
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,680
24 acres underglass and I'm going to

150
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,720
flood the market with with flour and

151
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,959
they say okay how sustainable is that

152
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,520
because right now you're getting x

153
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,318
amount per pound wholesale and then when

154
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,120
you go in and you pull this flower on

155
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,319
the market Market it's going to drop the

156
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,280
price so you know it's it's just a never

157
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,598
ending then the price goes down it goes

158
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,198
down it goes down to the point where now

159
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,319
you you priced yourself out of the

160
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
market by flooding the market so you

161
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,960
know you got to have a you got to really

162
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,840
understand your market and the strategy

163
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,079
and you got to understand what parts to

164
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,560
accelerate what parts to decelerate so

165
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,959
that's what I've seen as a big issue

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,280
with people good point uh well joh and I

167
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,120
think um I think good on them for giving

168
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,000
a goal to scale

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,639
um clearly it's because they use someone

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,800
else's money because otherwise you

171
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,439
wouldn't do it um the first question

172
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,360
that you need to ask yourself is can you

173
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,879
sell what you're actually producing now

174
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,400
back in the days when it was just

175
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,319
starting it was very obvious and

176
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,598
transparent from a regulatory

177
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,680
perspective that it wasn't a case of

178
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,800
build and they will come um because no

179
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,639
one's going to come if you can't sell

180
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,918
stuff that you actually grow so I was VI

181
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:07,918
perplexed early on looking at um the

182
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:10,038
cost of the scale um to do the business

183
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,839
um and what they could actually

184
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:17,279
essentially generate as revenue and the

185
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:20,159
revenue from my um analysis was was was

186
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,159
negligent because what they hadn't

187
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,160
surprisingly taken into consideration is

188
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,840
the fact that the regulatory framework

189
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,879
doesn't allow Australia to grow cannabis

190
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,359
and sell it just just to anybody in

191
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,479
different parts of the world obviously

192
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,360
we all know here we're very educated in

193
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:41,399
this space but for some reason I don't

194
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,879
think anyone um really took that into

195
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,318
account and therefore got a bit

196
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,439
overzealous um build it they will come

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,199
and we will sell it um interestingly now

198
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,560
those companies are complaining about

199
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,840
Imports um because they're saying we

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,598
can't make any money well of course they

201
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,918
can't make any money because you can't

202
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:02,079
make money if you're going to grow

203
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:06,000
something that cost you $10 if you can

204
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:08,038
buy it for $2 it's a commodity so I say

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,399
good on you for giving a goal they've

206
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,279
done an awful lot of heavy lifting but

207
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,359
for any company that wants to drive

208
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:16,878
Innovation I would suggest that what you

209
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,879
would do is you'd identify what the

210
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,240
disease state is that you want to focus

211
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,759
on and then you would Tinker around what

212
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,598
um ingredients and recipients whether

213
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:32,479
CBD or THC might address that market you

214
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,200
then take that product from your lab and

215
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,278
you go through the various clinical

216
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,599
trials to get it to the point of on

217
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:44,480
shelf so scale is all about having the

218
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,560
right

219
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,440
evidence-based paperwork to be able to

220
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,479
sell a product worldwide

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,480
otherwise how do you it's a complex

222
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,680
Market there's different regulations in

223
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,159
different markets if you think about

224
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,879
what GW did with the EP dialects they

225
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,360
focus on registering a medicine and

226
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,439
that's why they can actually be

227
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,839
recognized worldwide as a registered

228
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,399
medic and it's important what you said

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,760
also uh about the investment you know I

230
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,759
like to joke if you wouldn't use your

231
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,159
children's college fund money on it

232
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,838
don't do it just cuz investors are

233
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,240
giving you money now I can tell you that

234
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,560
that ship does not last for a long time

235
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,320
and then when it stops coming you're

236
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,838
you're out of luck uh Brian what do you

237
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,879
think I mean I'll I'll tie into that

238
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,680
which is the the investment may be here

239
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,759
now and there may be you know ample

240
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,078
funds to be able to find in this market

241
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,319
today but I could speak from experience

242
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:43,399
in other markets where as the industry

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,079
evolves if you're not returning for your

244
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,679
investors because you have not scaled

245
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:48,679
properly or have not built the business

246
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,599
properly that investment will dry up

247
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,039
quickly uh and which makes it

248
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,759
exponentially more difficult to achieve

249
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,519
your goals yeah and we're going to jump

250
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,759
a little more into investment later on

251
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,639
because that's such an important part of

252
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,120
this uh and we'll we'll talk about in a

253
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,559
moment but you know since we start off

254
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,278
with something negative and all these

255
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,159
disaster stories of what happens if you

256
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,559
don't plant a scale let's talk about

257
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,480
some examples of people who have scaled

258
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,159
I know you have some of your own

259
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,000
examples and don't be shy to talk about

260
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,679
them but you know let's talk about who's

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,320
done it right cuz some people have done

262
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,039
it right not many but some um so I'm a

263
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,160
little bit biased but I'm going to name

264
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:25,360
us origin nature of course um our vision

265
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,759
was really crawl walk run um so CIS you

266
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,480
need to understand is the most

267
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,919
wellestablished black market uh industry

268
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,320
in the world uh you know there wasn't

269
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,199
really ever an over Supply in Canada

270
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,800
there was big companies that grew a

271
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,600
bunch of [ __ ] weed that they couldn't

272
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,919
sell at the price they produced it at

273
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,278
and so they placed it as over production

274
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,240
because that's what they had to say we

275
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,720
first started by meeting the first

276
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,399
demand that was there in front of us so

277
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,440
we went to C the sqdc which is the

278
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,759
government uh the government control

279
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,279
Quebec and the distribution so we asked

280
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,639
them what do you want we want a sativa

281
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,720
$5 perfect we're going to build that

282
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,278
once we met that demand and we were able

283
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,120
to grow a life plant consistently

284
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:08,039
whether it was from the flower aspect

285
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,278
the Canin aspect and we were able to

286
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,039
build some brand recognition that's when

287
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,879
we decided to go ahead we also by that

288
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,159
by that time it was a project that

289
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,000
started with $6.6 million and we did a

290
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,399
dividend payout of $1.5 million after 18

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,480
months so we did secure an investors

292
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,679
before actually moving ahead and

293
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
expanding when we did that expansion we

294
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,838
didn't also place all our eggs in the

295
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,319
same basket we right away decided to go

296
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,360
to Germany to go to Australia uh um

297
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,800
contract growing also we didn't just

298
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,639
assume that everything we were going to

299
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,519
produce was going to go to the W Market

300
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,919
like before so we made sure to diversify

301
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,480
always have a plan A A Plan B a plan C

302
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,958
cuz Things fall out really quickly in

303
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,879
the canvas industry so we really took

304
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,719
our time to crawl walk run another good

305
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:57,240
expansion is the one that can did in in

306
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,680
uh Quebec so if you don't know te God

307
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,680
like to invest a lot of money in super

308
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,799
impressive uh green houses uh one I

309
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,239
think they did 60 million canara got it

310
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,759
back for 12 million they didn't turn

311
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,600
back on the entire facility when they

312
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,759
got it they're renting a lot of it to

313
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,800
other people they turned on little

314
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,159
section per little section as they were

315
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,240
rolling out their product throughout

316
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,399
Canada because you don't grow weed that

317
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,759
you haven't sold yet and so that's a

318
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,000
very good roll out from canera with a

319
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,799
gigantic facility that a lot of other

320
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,559
companies that were mentioned before

321
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,399
would try to just put in full-blown

322
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,679
activity like let's say a side in

323
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,879
Edmonton that was called

324
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,838
Sky yeah well there's many Canadian

325
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,559
examples of uh that but we won't get

326
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,680
into that George some with some good

327
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,958
examples yeah I've seen I've seen plenty

328
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,159
of them I mean there's an outfit out in

329
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,679
Las Vegas called Shango um they what I

330
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,159
really appreciate about what they did

331
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,439
was they had a plan they said this is

332
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,278
where we're going to be in one year two

333
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,800
years three years four years five years

334
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,519
they stuck to their plan they they they

335
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,799
had a building that was too big for what

336
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,639
they needed but they didn't fill up with

337
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,919
with other stuff they said okay this is

338
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,720
going to be future growth this is going

339
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,719
to be future growth so really the only

340
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,639
thing that they were stuck on was real

341
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
estate right so they didn't buy a bunch

342
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,879
of extra equipment they didn't buy a

343
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,039
bunch of extra Grow rooms um they they

344
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,198
sold vertically within their own

345
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,159
dispensary and then I also see it with

346
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:20,879
some of the big msos in the US as

347
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:24,919
opposed to some of the stuff that we saw

348
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:29,799
up in Canada as well um you know the air

349
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:32,319
Liberty Cresco um uh cure Le

350
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:33,599
um these are some they have they have a

351
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,480
lot of people that that are looking at

352
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,959
the Cannabis which is used to be

353
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:44,120
um what was the Cannabis called

354
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:46,159
before they're big I forgot the name but

355
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,839
but they're huge yeah you know who they

356
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,879
are who's who's called what the Cannabis

357
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,839
they're called the cannab the Cannabis

358
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:56,439
now acreage yeah yeah acreage hold yeah

359
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,639
so but they they you know they they have

360
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,279
good plans and and I always find that

361
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,879
the people right plans with the good

362
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:05,639
plans that follow the plan you know hey

363
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,600
by the way you know look at this bubble

364
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,959
hash or look you know we want to do this

365
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
other product over here follow the plan

366
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,958
because if you're thinking that you're

367
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,839
going to do it there's already 12 other

368
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,439
people out there thinking they're going

369
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,680
to do it how much you think that people

370
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
are going to buy how many people are

371
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,679
going to buy it guys you know and know

372
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,599
your audience the other thing I see is

373
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,399
you know people that that know who their

374
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,560
buyers are because somebody said it

375
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,440
earlier but you have you know somebody

376
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,879
goes out there says yeah I I grow a ton

377
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,360
of month I'm like great well where do

378
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,838
you sell that well we we use half of it

379
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,399
ourselves and then we we're we're going

380
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,639
to export it to freaking uh

381
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,240
Antarctica you know and it's like okay

382
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,639
do you have a distribution Network set

383
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,079
up because because not only have I heard

384
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,759
that from you I've heard that from the

385
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,519
last 20 people I've talked to

386
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,240
everybody's going to sell you know flour

387
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,919
in Germany everybody's going to flow

388
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,759
sunflower and mol every got you know

389
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,919
everybody's in so you really got to

390
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:01,079
understand your Market of what you're

391
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,639
going to sell because you might think

392
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,879
you're going to sell a ton a month and

393
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,360
you're not you know are I have to give I

394
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,159
have to use a quote to something you

395
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,079
just said Mike Tyson I have to quote

396
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,679
Mike Tyson to say everyone has a plan

397
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,638
until you get punched in the face I

398
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,958
don't know if anyone knows that line but

399
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
that's actually works in the Cannabis

400
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,919
industry completely like so you have a

401
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,959
plan but then you get punched in the

402
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,559
face by the regulations or or something

403
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,278
else or the the bank or whatever and

404
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,159
then sometimes you got to Pivot but uh

405
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,078
Fair Point uh what else do you guys

406
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,278
think

407
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:36,000
I agree 100 good examples yeah very good

408
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,639
yeah and I agree in terms of um and and

409
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,720
my introduction earlier I mentioned that

410
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,198
we're laser focused that's the reason

411
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,079
and like that I've actually experienced

412
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,958
a lot of different companies going oh

413
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,758
it's co let's do this oh it's that let's

414
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,359
do that so they keep jumping all over

415
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,318
the place so I think for me it's a bit

416
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,199
different in terms of what I see is

417
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,639
Success because I'm not looking at it

418
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,919
from a how do we self lower or how do we

419
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,639
man ufacture stuff or how do we grow

420
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,198
stuff because we're about drug

421
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,159
development so the companies that we

422
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,198
look at in terms of the ones that are

423
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,919
exceptional are doing at scale are

424
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:15,479
companies like GW Pharma that have spent

425
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:18,479
the time to um invest in the clinical

426
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,120
data um getting the results that is

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,639
required to get registration and then

428
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,360
investing in that registration and of

429
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,759
course that worked out very well for

430
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,639
them as we all know because as soon as

431
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,959
that one product was registered they

432
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,399
sold for $7.8 billion to Jazz

433
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,159
pharmaceutical so from our point of view

434
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,679
we' have been laser focus from the

435
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,318
beginning it's very much on that pathway

436
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,359
it's about what products what indication

437
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:48,599
and what can we

438
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,839
realistically um register in terms of

439
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,240
the Cannabis in general I think that I

440
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,680
would say to everyone here um it's very

441
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,600
important of course cash flow we all

442
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,879
need a bit of cash flow

443
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,160
so for us for example At OMG we have two

444
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,240
divisions I'm not selling anything I'm

445
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,038
just trying to give you a bit of an idea

446
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,679
is to tell in terms of the strategy um

447
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,919
one of them is a division that we can

448
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,640
sell products over the counter I won't

449
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,079
get into the details and that early

450
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,679
stage that allowed us early stage

451
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,000
Revenue quite significant and enough

452
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,480
that we can invest that money straight

453
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
into the clinical trial which means that

454
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,279
as a company we're not out looking for

455
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,160
investors we're not scratching around

456
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,399
try to get a dollar here or a dollar

457
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,480
there we're very focused we had the

458
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,440
budget when we started and we're going

459
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,880
down that pathway so any company that

460
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,440
puts in the time and the hard jards and

461
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,960
the money because it's not for the

462
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,919
fainthearted um is about Gathering the

463
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,679
evidence so that they can have a product

464
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,759
that

465
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,038
worldwide can be

466
00:17:54,759 --> 00:18:00,720
sold yeah no that's a very that's a very

467
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,839
good point uh Brian sure to give you two

468
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,200
examples uh both of these from the

469
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,759
states of Camp companies that were

470
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,519
successful in scaling uh one brand

471
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:16,720
called wild w yld d the other called

472
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:19,359
Wana W na both uh gummies Edibles Brands

473
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,839
um the to me their success has been

474
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,558
dictated by two things they've stayed

475
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,079
very asset light where they proved their

476
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,480
model in one market and then took that

477
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,918
model and licensed it to many other

478
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,798
markets uh and didn't go through all of

479
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,799
the capital expenditures of building

480
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:38,359
their own facility in every individual

481
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,720
Market uh they took their IP made sure

482
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,158
that it was easily repeatable uh and

483
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,960
placed it wherever they could and

484
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,440
managed the quality control through

485
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,640
those agreements uh if you can stay

486
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,120
asset light it's going to make scaling

487
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,600
much easier because you won't need as

488
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:54,599
much investment

489
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,439
obviously that's a excellent point and

490
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,480
you know one thing I've heard from all

491
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,120
four of you I think that's really

492
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,960
important is the import to being focused

493
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,119
but also having a business that funds

494
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,079
your business like it's nice to have big

495
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,759
plans and Innovative and be a dreamer I

496
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,439
mean yeah we need that and in cannabis

497
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,839
we're always pushing the boundaries but

498
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,080
you also need a business like at lch we

499
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:16,199
also do contract manufacturing we make

500
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,798
products for some of the biggest

501
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,880
companies in Canada we don't make a lot

502
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:21,759
of money on it it's a volume thing but

503
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,480
it keeps the lights on so that we can

504
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,000
actually have some of our own Brands and

505
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,120
and try to do Innovation and I think I

506
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,119
heard that from all four of you uh you

507
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,519
know much like in California which

508
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,959
people think is an awesome Market you go

509
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,918
to La and you're like wow this is the

510
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,400
best Market I've ever seen but then you

511
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,960
actually talk to the business owners who

512
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,280
own the businesses and they're they're

513
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,038
dying they're not making money and I

514
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,119
said how is that possible the ones that

515
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,480
survive are finding other ways to make

516
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,639
money which I won't say uh up here on

517
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,079
the stage but you got to find ways to

518
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,360
make money to fund your dreams and hopes

519
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,199
but uh you know as we're looking at uh

520
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,038
funding you know this is such an

521
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,279
important part and me and Brian were

522
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,200
talking about this before and a few of

523
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,839
us backstage it's nice to have these

524
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,558
dreams but if no one's funding These

525
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,038
Dreams they're they're just going to be

526
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:04,639
dreams and if you think they're going to

527
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,720
be funded later like hey let's just get

528
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,799
started and we'll find the funding later

529
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,319
I've seen many shutter down facilities

530
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,798
we were talking an example you were

531
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,720
saying the caner example how they bought

532
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:15,879
over a facility of a bankrupt company

533
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,558
that's that's a good strategy because

534
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,280
that other company didn't plan for

535
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:20,480
funding maybe Brian if you want to start

536
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,918
off you have a lot of experience with

537
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,079
this how important is funding and what

538
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,280
what can you what kind of advice can you

539
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,720
give these people when it comes to that

540
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,798
sure yeah I mean something I like to say

541
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,798
is that funding is the fuel that that

542
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,440
really lights the fire without it you

543
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,079
have no fire your business goes goes out

544
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,600
uh number one thing uh that I've seen in

545
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,759
the last two three years the big

546
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:46,199
difference from say 5 to 10 years ago uh

547
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,240
is that everyone is focused tremendously

548
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,120
on iida are we making money can we make

549
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,880
money uh and so in order to illustrate

550
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:58,000
that I emphasize the importance of

551
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,600
having a a business model a financial

552
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,839
model that's you know on paper that

553
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,798
actually withstands

554
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,759
practical

555
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:12,400
experience years ago say 2012 to

556
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:17,319
2018 most models were based

557
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,679
on I mean hopes hopes and dreams that

558
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:23,200
didn't come to fruition uh often the

559
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,640
business model was showing a relatively

560
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,038
steady line of wholesale pricing for all

561
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,080
of the product uh which as we all

562
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,200
understand supply and demand as that

563
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,119
market saturates that price creaters uh

564
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,558
which makes know everything more

565
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,599
difficult and makes the model Now fail

566
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:44,200
uh so what the best way is to be able to

567
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,480
show that model can work with practical

568
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,360
knowledge

569
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,038
showing some commonalities between

570
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,359
markets every Market's going to be

571
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,720
independent whether we're talking

572
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,519
Germany or then other European countries

573
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,880
Canada or any other you know state in

574
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,400
the US everything's going could be a

575
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,360
little bit different but they all follow

576
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,080
a very similar path where prices are

577
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,479
very high early on and you can take that

578
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,480
extra margin reinvest in your business

579
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,679
like we're saying if your business can't

580
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,159
continue to fuel your business you will

581
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:20,840
again run out of run out of fuel uh but

582
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:23,760
really um if we can oh just just lost

583
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,359
that train of thought I get because you

584
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,000
said bless you in your mind I also do

585
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,558
that if I see I always say bless you but

586
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,119
no those are those are some really good

587
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,798
points uh George uh I I know you I'm

588
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,000
sure have some thoughts on funding and

589
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,679
investing uh like making sure you're

590
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,079
well funded and John we were talking

591
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,798
backstage uh how how important is being

592
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,960
well funded and and having the right

593
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:45,119
investors in

594
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,640
this well I don't know cuz I haven't got

595
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:52,278
any okay so so maybe's your secret and

596
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,159
the reason is be deliberate deliberate

597
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,519
because I believe just like you said if

598
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,679
you don't spend your grandchildren's

599
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,599
whatever it is and heritance so you're

600
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,840
not going to put your own money in in

601
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,519
your bucket

602
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:09,599
so Scottish people tend to shove their

603
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:14,079
own money in make it work build it tweak

604
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:18,000
it build value and then we can talk

605
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:21,000
about Investors investor opportunity but

606
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,919
until there's value I wouldn't invest in

607
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,599
a company that I didn't see an end

608
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:30,000
result so in actual fact

609
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:32,319
my um my desire was to invest in a

610
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,240
company that's all I wanted to do

611
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,319
because of the all of the stuff and I

612
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,000
won't bore you with the details but by

613
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,798
exciting Market but

614
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,759
interestingly when I went and met people

615
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:48,038
all over the world it was wonderfully

616
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:50,879
exciting their decks and their

617
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:53,720
positioning and they were going to make

618
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,278
gazillions of money but when you start

619
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,839
to ask them questions about well who you

620
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:00,960
selling it to yeah it's like like well

621
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,359
anybody can buy it we'll sell it to

622
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,000
anybody you know any everybody's going

623
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,079
to want it but of course we know this is

624
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,319
medicine and I'm talking about from a

625
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,278
medicinal perspective so it's not as

626
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:15,960
easy just to sell stuff so we were very

627
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:19,960
deliberate not to go out and um and to

628
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,880
raise funds until we actually gathered

629
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,759
the evidence created and developed our

630
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
own products not white labored products

631
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,879
and we actually started selling them so

632
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,960
obviously we were six years in that

633
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,840
development stage and for the last years

634
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,360
we've launched worldwide with our

635
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:40,000
products so in terms of the the going

636
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,798
out and talking about investment it's

637
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,640
not something that we're actively

638
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,319
looking at now now the group CEOs in the

639
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
room somewhere he's probably got a

640
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,720
different perspective um in terms of the

641
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,360
future um the co is usually the one that

642
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,558
has to worry about that he'll be worried

643
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,158
about that he's telling me that we he'll

644
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:00,240
probably have a different view on that

645
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,200
but for us for me I will only only

646
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,319
invest in something if I can see

647
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,880
something that is going to give I like a

648
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,759
bit of Blue Sky don't get me wrong but I

649
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,720
need to see something what is it that

650
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,200
you're going to have if it's a CBD

651
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,798
product then it has to be different from

652
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,679
any other CBD product well if you can't

653
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:20,079
make it different then what viable

654
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,480
product have you got that you're going

655
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,599
to generate revenue from because if

656
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,759
everybody's got a CBD product and it's

657
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:31,558
CBD or THC what makes a difference then

658
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:35,038
we get in to the price to the bottom so

659
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,839
for us it's it's it's it's more

660
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,038
important to build the value so that

661
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,278
investors will come we don't want to

662
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,398
have to go out and start spooking we

663
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,200
want to say look at what we've done is

664
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:48,959
this something that you feel will value

665
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,880
and would that resonate to your um your

666
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,798
investment strategy then we can have a

667
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,520
discussion right and yeah but not with

668
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,398
me cuz I can't talk about money with

669
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,278
anybody but we can talk to the group

670
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:01,398
anybody of any interest in that front

671
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,240
yeah and uh yeah I'm sure I'm sure he

672
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,558
would have a different perspective of it

673
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,000
and we were talking with Brian also

674
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,319
around the importance of complacency and

675
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,679
not being complacent and how complacency

676
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,960
can kill you like you're in a great

677
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,278
position you're a leader everyone's

678
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,519
giving you money you be careful cuz

679
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,159
someone's coming after that very quickly

680
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,038
and you can change you know I I remember

681
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,880
I was here a few years ago and someone

682
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,398
asked a question what's the num number

683
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,080
one piece of advice you would give

684
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:26,719
someone to get for the Cannabis industry

685
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,000
I was like w it's a lot of pressure I

686
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,440
have like literally one minute to answer

687
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,159
a question question and I said be

688
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,159
careful you get your money from when you

689
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,278
get investment don't just be excited

690
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,120
that someone wants to invest in your

691
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:37,119
company like someone might want to

692
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,439
invest in your company and that's going

693
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,839
to destroy you because the wrong

694
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,600
investor is going to whip you and make

695
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,798
you rush and all of a sudden you're

696
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,199
tripping on yourself and you're not

697
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:47,639
executing your plan the way you thought

698
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,960
you were and boom you've actually lost

699
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,799
your whole business because you took the

700
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,798
wrong investor on so uh Brian what do

701
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:53,038
you think about that I'm sure you have

702
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:55,960
some thoughts yeah I was just going to

703
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,879
add that cannabis is so unique and again

704
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,519
you know Market by market it's so unique

705
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,480
that you need an investor that has an

706
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,119
open mind so that they're not forcing

707
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,079
your hand there's so many situations

708
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,719
that come up where a regulation changes

709
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:11,038
or perhaps we're doing it this way in

710
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,558
one market but the regulations Force us

711
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,240
to do it that way in another in a lot of

712
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:18,759
scenarios an uninformed investor the

713
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,159
wrong investor doesn't fully understand

714
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:23,119
the true length of time that it's going

715
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,880
to take to execute on that change or

716
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,639
that idea and creates a false pressure

717
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,200
that then forces decisions that hinder

718
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,360
the business long term yeah or even

719
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,319
worse if you ever seen an investor who

720
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,479
gives you advice he invests and all of a

721
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,639
sudden they start telling you how to run

722
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,079
your business I've seen that before and

723
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
it's like excuse me if you knew how to

724
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,599
run the business you'd be running the

725
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,798
business and not just as an investor I

726
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,158
don't know if you've seen that before

727
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:47,759
but it's pretty crazy well I I wanted

728
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,519
exactly to touch on that like we're

729
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,240
talking about getting funding but you

730
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,440
exactly what you said you should ver

731
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,200
watch out who you get that money for you

732
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,320
should probably not have invested on the

733
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,319
board also that have divesting interests

734
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,839
on what's actually happening right you

735
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,319
need when you build a canas company it's

736
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,038
not easy money it's a lot of hard work

737
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,480
scaling up takes a lot of time to be

738
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:12,079
done properly so it's very important to

739
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,558
find the right people to put on the bus

740
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,158
before you're actually driving that bus

741
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,200
and one thing that we've learned is you

742
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,399
know uh to get the 40 investor to start

743
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,840
origin nature there was over 400 meeting

744
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:28,158
right so every no gets you closer to

745
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,839
that yes for every nine person you see

746
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,440
find the right one but do not haste in

747
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,000
getting money do not haste in you know

748
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,240
most people that don't understand canvas

749
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,960
are going to try to push you to do

750
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,278
absolutely everything pre-rolls canas

751
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,000
2.0 just expand expand spread your res

752
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:43,359
psychedelics why not psychedelics too

753
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,558
whatever mushrooms let's do it and that

754
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,678
will kill your business so get the right

755
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,480
people on board before you drive the bus

756
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,640
and get it to the right place everybody

757
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,759
needs to be align so don't just rush

758
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,480
into getting

759
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,960
money and just from a perspective of

760
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,880
seeing a bunch of different C SC arios

761
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,319
you

762
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,679
know you got to really understand your

763
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,759
investor and their motivation that's the

764
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,519
key thing is their motivation are they

765
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,079
out there yeah are they are they there

766
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,558
to make money yes but are they either to

767
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,759
make money in the short term or the long

768
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,440
term and how much are they how much are

769
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,720
they going to try to influence you to

770
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,000
change your plan and how

771
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,919
much how much influence do they have

772
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,398
over your plan so you just got to be

773
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,399
careful with investors because if you

774
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,119
don't play it right they're going to be

775
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,000
up they're going to end up being claim

776
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,678
filers and further riding the bus it's

777
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,880
like he's going to hijack the bus right

778
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,240
you just invited him on a seat on the

779
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,278
bus next thing you know he's kicking you

780
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,919
out in your he's driving your bus to use

781
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,079
that analogy but uh we're going to open

782
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,159
up the questions in one moment so

783
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,558
hopefully some people have some

784
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,679
questions I see some people looking over

785
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,440
there one last couple quick bullet

786
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,519
thoughts on International markets that

787
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,960
either you're scaling to currently or

788
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,599
that you're hopeful for uh to scale to

789
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,000
one day I met someone earlier that's

790
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,119
waiting for Mexico to open up and he's

791
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,919
like Mexico's going to be so huge I'm

792
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,719
like yeah keep waiting but yeah maybe

793
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:04,679
one day but maybe something a little

794
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,399
closer uh that's that's actually

795
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,840
happening faster or that's you're doing

796
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,558
right now any any thoughts on countries

797
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:14,359
I'll kick it off with uh Thailand uh

798
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:15,398
seeing Thailand really explode um

799
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,839
something I've been learning about in

800
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,398
the last couple of days is just

801
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,038
exponentially that the growth that we're

802
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:24,518
seeing there uh that excites me because

803
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,398
it seems to be a uh an interesting

804
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,240
Market to to see well we should talk

805
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,678
about that because they've exploded and

806
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
then imploded but that's a story for a

807
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,919
different panel but we can talk about

808
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,798
that after that's an interesting thing

809
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,640
sorry to jump over but so I've met

810
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,440
probably a dozen people I said oh yeah

811
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,960
we're going to grow in in our country

812
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,480
and we're going to send it to Thailand

813
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,720
yeah yeah yeah but yet you know and and

814
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,919
more than there's more than a dozen I

815
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,640
was just being fous right but yet the

816
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,600
Thailand um you know you don't know if

817
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,278
Thailand comes back and says hey look

818
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,398
we're going to buy flower from within

819
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,119
our own country first now what is that

820
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:58,678
person who's just said oh I'm going to

821
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,759
grow this whole truck full and I'm going

822
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,120
to send it to T they don't even have a

823
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,240
lab my friend ATA is setting up a

824
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,518
laboratory there there is no laboratory

825
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,960
why would you send weed to Thailand

826
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,919
Thailand can grow weed for nickola

827
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,159
gram right the true nickel bag they

828
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,480
don't they don't want your weed I need

829
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,760
that sound bite to play like 12 times a

830
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,558
day next time someone says that to you

831
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,879
just be like hold on go talk to that guy

832
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:22,519
uh I'll tell him I'll be honest about it

833
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,919
yeah it's like that's a good should I

834
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:27,599
say that aloud so I won't say that fine

835
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,840
um you want to open up the question

836
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,038
sorry no no no no it's okay you know

837
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:31,558
what I see some people with questions

838
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,240
very but you did you know these people

839
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,480
paid a lot of money to come to the show

840
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,359
they did they paid a lot of money to ask

841
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,798
good question so who I see some hands

842
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,319
over there there's one over here he only

843
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,359
takes questions beside him by the way so

844
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:46,519
you actually have to like go

845
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,199
close thank you gentlemen uh considering

846
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,000
customer excuse me considering customer

847
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,519
confidence quality and service which

848
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,839
would you say is the most important and

849
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,919
why when building a successful brand or

850
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,158
company what were they again the three

851
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,038
things again customer service quality

852
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,278
customer confidence quality and service

853
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:04,798
which would be the most important and

854
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,679
why when you're attempting to build a

855
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,839
successful brand or company I would go

856
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,360
with C uh customer confidence so

857
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,119
establishing a brand in canas is

858
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,918
extremely hard uh all that American way

859
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:17,558
of pumping a lot of money in marketing

860
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,080
does not work in canas you're only one

861
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,678
lot away from losing all your clients uh

862
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,119
in the sense that it's a recession

863
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,360
people want something that every time

864
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,918
they pay for it it's going to be the

865
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,398
same effect it's going to be what they

866
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,960
paid for it's not going to be one batch

867
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,479
at 20% the other batch at 28 and I'm

868
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,919
really talking dry flower right I'm not

869
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,079
on the Pharma side so it is custumer

870
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,278
confidence for us to build a brand

871
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:42,439
recognition we had to be the number one

872
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,519
selling sativa for the last four years

873
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,840
before it actually started to happen

874
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,679
there is absolutely no brand loyalty as

875
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,038
there shouldn't be at the beginning of

876
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,000
an industry cuz we saw how that went

877
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,000
through there's no celebrity brand in

878
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,519
Canada that actually did good the Snoop

879
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,440
Dog weed was terrible like so that you

880
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,960
need to understand you cannot sell weed

881
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,000
with a lie consumers will not be tricked

882
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,679
so gaining their confidence at every

883
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,919
time they go to that store and they buy

884
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,200
that pouch or that bottle it's the weed

885
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,480
that they want and it's going to be the

886
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,200
same time same thing time and time again

887
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,399
within a very reasonable canaban range

888
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,278
is the hardest you can do by growing a

889
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,239
life and don't go telling the booth out

890
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,000
there who has the Snoop brand uh that

891
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,200
someone on the panel said that uh just

892
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,159
don't don't mention that but yeah

893
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,038
celebrity thing agree with his answer

894
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,080
with everything else comes from consumer

895
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:34,879
confidence quality customer everything

896
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,278
else if confidence is there all the rest

897
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,440
Falls in Brian what you think just going

898
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:41,079
to say quality above all else I mean the

899
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,679
consumer confidence that's it I mean if

900
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:45,278
if you can't produce a quality product

901
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,120
time and again it's over consistency and

902
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,159
standardization I think that's the kind

903
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,959
of key with those words uh question over

904
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,399
here question over here over there hi uh

905
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,240
thanks for being here uh question two

906
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:59,359
questions question number one we have

907
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,079
Partners in growing in Columbia I uh

908
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,558
what type of advice and what do you

909
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,480
think would be the future of growing

910
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,918
Colombia and actually exporting medical

911
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,240
to Europe question number two now that

912
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,119
we finally open up in Germany on Social

913
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:17,439
Clubs starting July 1st in order to

914
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,519
apply for the growing license um any

915
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,760
advice in our personal interest as well

916
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,639
that we now want to start kind of a

917
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,960
social club in Berlin um any advice on

918
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,119
that your Congress can give if I just

919
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,559
quickly start off by saying we I we need

920
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,639
to stop calling them Social Clubs I did

921
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,559
a panel yesterday at 11 there's nothing

922
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,200
social about these Social Clubs we were

923
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,000
joking they're called antisocial Social

924
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,158
Clubs because they actually do not allow

925
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,639
you to consume they're really more like

926
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,679
grow clubs um and yeah the advice you

927
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,039
should have been to my panel yesterday

928
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,240
but Colombia quick thought they're

929
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,679
actually finally doing something

930
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,838
impressive I thought I saw the number I

931
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,079
think they did about $1 million it took

932
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,000
many many years to get there but I think

933
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,599
they're finally doing something

934
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,159
impressive if they can get eug GMP

935
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,119
certified product and there's a few that

936
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,000
do it and they realize that stuff is

937
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,680
going to demand a lower price point I

938
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,400
think there's an opportunity there those

939
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:07,159
are my thoughts and I've got clients in

940
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Colombia and we got units in Colombia um

941
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:13,239
the the the thing about Colombia is is

942
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,320
the is the uh the the stigma you know

943
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,479
the uh the the history the culture the

944
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,920
you know Colombia can really break out

945
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,400
by by exploiting hey you know we this is

946
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,039
the jungle grown this is the this is

947
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,280
this is from the mother earth you know

948
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,759
it's this is this is what been around

949
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,680
for years and years yeah the rainforest

950
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,839
everything I mean so it's I think it's a

951
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:36,598
lot of branding and and bringing

952
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:38,279
something different to the table and I

953
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,039
think that's something that that you

954
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,440
know Thailand you know Australia all

955
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,679
these places Germany you know it's funny

956
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,720
because people want to export everywhere

957
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:50,480
and everything you know but you know

958
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,838
it's they're they're making the same

959
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,480
strains you know like if you like

960
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:57,199
Colombian coffee where do you get a load

961
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,159
of Colombian cannabis yeah right right

962
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:02,598
col the smart man at ball all the C all

963
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,519
the c letters I noticed they're with the

964
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,160
letter c but you really have a good

965
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:08,239
opportunity in Columbia especially you

966
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,960
know the clients I have down there is to

967
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,519
is to really like homeo county in

968
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,358
California you know you know they

969
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,358
they've got the brand there because hey

970
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,920
you know where the guy you OG's of of of

971
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,639
weed in the US Colombia is the OG of

972
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,760
weed in the world you know so and I

973
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:25,159
would answer to to the Social Club um

974
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,599
we're going to really going to have to

975
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:30,000
build a very strong business model to be

976
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,920
able to design that operation and design

977
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,559
that facility to execute on that mainly

978
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,039
because of your not for-profit

979
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,559
requirement at least for now uh we'll

980
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:42,920
want to make sure that the money that

981
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,639
you have we put it to the best use

982
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,800
possible to be able to produce

983
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,559
consistently for your members so that

984
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,519
you don't risk them jumping to another

985
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,519
club because the way I see it is you're

986
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:54,159
going to want to retain those members

987
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:56,000
forever so that you can keep that

988
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,639
revenue from them and there's going to

989
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,519
be a way to design and build facility to

990
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,960
be able to keep it as as operationally

991
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,719
efficient and keep your costs low so

992
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,280
that you can provide really cost

993
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,838
effective product to your members to

994
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,319
keep them yeah and Alex you had a super

995
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:14,358
quick point before yeah so um for the

996
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:16,199
canas clubs uh for me I think it's a

997
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:18,559
legalization that's kind of broken it's

998
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,838
going to change for sure uh the reality

999
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,639
of the fact is you know I I explained

1000
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,039
Greenhouse weed and outdoor weed is not

1001
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,879
consistent it's not necessarily going to

1002
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:27,838
meet regulations not necessarily be able

1003
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,400
to build a brand on it the real value of

1004
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,400
the fact is Germany does not have the

1005
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,639
power grid to supply indoor uh

1006
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,720
cultivation of canvas it's just not

1007
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:37,279
possible with the power you guys have we

1008
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,598
barely have enough and we're the number

1009
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,280
one supplier right um so what's going to

1010
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,519
happen is once you can't meet demand of

1011
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,720
proper canvas you're going to promote

1012
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,960
the black market if you don't uh help it

1013
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,078
so I will build build a very small

1014
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,800
facility 300 kg can be ran by 200 meter

1015
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,079
of canopy flowering space right and gear

1016
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,280
up to bring in Imports of course the

1017
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,920
Imports are going to come in cuz you're

1018
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,119
going need to supply all that demand so

1019
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,358
it's

1020
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,480
unrealistic like honestly guys there's

1021
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:09,119
at least 200 tons of consumption

1022
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,960
probably in Germany alone Quebec is 300

1023
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,440
tons per year with the black market by

1024
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,880
the way Poland has the lowest cost of

1025
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,079
electricity in the Europe Europe so I

1026
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,240
don't know if there's any Polish people

1027
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,079
here but I think you have an advantage

1028
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:24,000
sorry go ahead question any um so say

1029
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,160
someone would have a um a relatively

1030
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,519
successful business that they built from

1031
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:32,239
uh from nothing but they think that um

1032
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,719
they probably need some advice to get it

1033
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,838
beyond that point and they're thinking

1034
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,799
maybe of an Advisory Board like what

1035
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:43,519
would be some of the maybe Unwritten

1036
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,160
rules of engaging someone to say hey

1037
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,599
would you be maybe interested in that

1038
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,759
well first of all I think advisory

1039
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,039
boards are one of the most important

1040
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,359
things I'm a huge fan of advisory boards

1041
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:54,079
I sit on a few and always recommend that

1042
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:55,159
I mean to give you tips I think there's

1043
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,960
a long conversation I don't know if

1044
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,598
anyone wants to throw a few tips but

1045
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,119
you're welcome to to come see us after

1046
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,160
I'm happy to kind of give you some

1047
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,720
thoughts on that cuz I have like a

1048
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:06,199
40-minute keynote on advisory boards all

1049
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,159
right yeah just carefully because I know

1050
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:11,439
I know you're a consultant but he's a

1051
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,838
wellestablished consultant so ask around

1052
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,240
I used to be a consultant not in this

1053
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,838
space but years ago ask around ask for

1054
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,639
um if you're going to go the consultant

1055
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:23,039
route having Consultants um give you

1056
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,639
input and help you helping you to steer

1057
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,759
decisions are is very good but ask

1058
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:30,879
around uh make sure that they have I met

1059
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,520
somebody yesterday was a car salesman

1060
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,800
like a year ago now they're you know you

1061
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:36,559
actually just reminded me last year

1062
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,359
someone asked me about um uh about the

1063
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,960
importance of advisers and and what I

1064
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:41,759
told them is make sure your consultant

1065
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,480
your adviser actually has done it so

1066
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,599
many people are consultants and advisers

1067
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,880
who have never actually done those

1068
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,680
things they're Consulting and Advising

1069
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,599
on so like make sure they've actually

1070
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,719
successfully done it people like oh I've

1071
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,400
done this this this was that successful

1072
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,000
oh no uh this is the reason it wasn't

1073
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,000
successful like okay I don't care do you

1074
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,838
have any successes no wrong person

1075
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,079
sorry next last one U thank you guys so

1076
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:09,239
much Nea vesa here uh quick question

1077
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,839
pivot off of what Alex uh you said it

1078
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,919
earlier Alex or Alex the French one or

1079
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:15,639
the Canadian one French oh ition about

1080
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,680
French all right but this applied name

1081
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,838
is i' love to hear any answer from

1082
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,000
anyone here you me you mentioned

1083
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,920
something very quickly which is try to

1084
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
convince your investor or enable like

1085
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,680
not have them on your board every that's

1086
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,119
one of the biggest things I always see

1087
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,559
anytime you're taking money they almost

1088
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,920
always want at least a board seat how do

1089
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,719
you how have you ever seen it

1090
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,200
successfully convinced an investor most

1091
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,639
investors actually want to have a seat

1092
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,719
on the board when you said how don't let

1093
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,199
them have a seat on the board I was

1094
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,439
going to say that's a very hard thing to

1095
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:43,799
say real investors are like they don't

1096
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,159
trust anyone and they want to see on the

1097
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,880
board but isn't there a percentage you

1098
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,480
know like hey look if they're going to

1099
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,960
throw 40% in you know but if they're

1100
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,679
going to put in hey here's here's two

1101
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,240
grand I want to see it on your board

1102
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,519
absolutely take a hike guy and that's

1103
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,838
what we mean by choose your money

1104
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,280
carefully if someone's going to be

1105
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:00,358
giving you that much money to be sitting

1106
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,319
on the board you want that person to

1107
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,279
have the proper qualification and share

1108
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,639
the passion and the value when I say we

1109
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,720
build a cabase business and we do 1.5

1110
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,519
mil dividend in 18 months if that's

1111
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,358
division forever it's going to be hard

1112
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,440
for us to scale up at some point we can

1113
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:16,199
be paying gigantic dividend and scaling

1114
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,318
up at the same time so that's where the

1115
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:20,000
vision needs to be understood you know

1116
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,679
also you know do you want to build a

1117
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,159
business that's going to be a legacy

1118
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,679
that's going to live on after you're

1119
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,559
done with it or sell have you ever heard

1120
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:29,000
of an instance where an investor was

1121
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,599
like I don't need the board seat um

1122
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,599
unfortunately I'm not the most

1123
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,559
well-versed uh you know my professional

1124
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,200
career is mostly cannabis before that I

1125
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,799
didn't really go to school so I'm not

1126
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,919
the best one to answer that question but

1127
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,519
but I will point out I think it's okay

1128
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,519
for them to have a seat at the table but

1129
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,440
as long as it's a seat and nothing more

1130
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,920
than that I think it's all majority

1131
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,480
board's made up of five people seven

1132
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,480
people as long as there's less of

1133
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,280
investors versus actual business people

1134
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,719
on there I think you're okay but yeah

1135
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,280
having a seat at the table I think is

1136
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,799
okay so they know what's going on and

1137
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,920
they feel comfortable and hey sometimes

1138
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,400
you actually need need more money from

1139
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,800
those investors they're the easiest

1140
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,800
people to get more money from so if they

1141
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,760
know what's going on and they feel

1142
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,000
comfortable they're the most likely to

1143
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,960
reup and add more money which is kind of

1144
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,838
but what's that percentage what's that

1145
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,920
percentage where you go back to somebody

1146
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,318
who wants to invest and you say well if

1147
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,039
you give 20% or whatever what's the

1148
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,800
percentage to get them good point I

1149
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,679
think 20% if you have anything less than

1150
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,839
20% you can't even ask them for a board

1151
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,759
seat I I think if you have at least 20%

1152
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,759
invested you can actually request but if

1153
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,280
you're like 5% I don't know unless

1154
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,599
you're awesome and they really like you

1155
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,000
sometimes people that's actually a quick

1156
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,680
Point uh invest having an a strategic

1157
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,280
investor sometimes it's not even about

1158
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,000
the money honestly this might sound

1159
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,920
crazy to say at a business conference

1160
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,079
the money is not the hard part I swear

1161
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,358
to you if you have a really good

1162
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,880
business and you have really talented

1163
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,960
people lots of people will give you

1164
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,599
money it's about taking the smart money

1165
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,280
and having strategic investors that will

1166
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:49,680
do more for you than just give you money

1167
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,280
