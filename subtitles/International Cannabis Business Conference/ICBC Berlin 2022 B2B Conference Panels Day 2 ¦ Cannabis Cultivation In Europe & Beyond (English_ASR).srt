1
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,160
san francisco is number one

2
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,518
manufacturing

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,600
and distribution

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,160
we also cultivate flowers and have been

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,840
in this business for about 20 years

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,198
i was arrested by the federal government

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,879
in 99 which then positioned me now to be

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,800
the social equity commissioner in san

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,640
francisco which allowed us to pull

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
licenses for those who had been

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,719
disadvantaged by the war on drugs

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
you might know some of our strains like

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,719
lamb's breath sunset sherbet those are

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,200
some of the strains that we are behind

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,640
so that earned me the honor to be here

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,399
today and to moderate the panel with

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,719
a group of very very knowledgeable

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,558
growers in cannabis folks so

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
that moved far away from you i don't

20
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,919
know why you guys went so far because

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
you're very scared it smells good oh you

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
got some light all right

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,359
so

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,520
that being said i'd like to start the um

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
panel we have one question that we kind

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
of like to use as an icebreaker which is

27
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,079
where the panel sees international

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,640
cannabis going in the next few years and

29
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,450
with that i'll pass it to travis

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,599
uh thank you very much ali um

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,759
[Music]

32
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,839
international cannabis uh as we've all

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,640
heard throughout this uh this this time

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
here

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,920
is

36
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,359
really headed to where can we learn from

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
the places that have already done this

38
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,438
right and i think

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
uh it's very interesting to

40
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,438
equate it to a match uh every single

41
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,879
state that we've looked at in the past

42
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,319
is a match that takes a while to get

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,319
started but once it does it burns really

44
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,919
really bright for a period of time let's

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,199
call it three years and every single

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040
person who gets into it uh franklin is

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
going to make money for a period of time

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
and then it's going to burn and simmer

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
down and those who

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
came into it from with the right

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
headspace and really

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,280
double down and really focused on

53
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,718
systems and process right from a uh an

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,519
optimizing cultivation those are the

55
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,000
ones who in the long term are going to

56
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,280
make it past the ember and we've seen

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,359
this in every single state where they

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
burn bright and they kind of dissipated

59
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,639
the ones who make it all the way to the

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,239
end will be the ones that are around for

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,238
a lifetime so that's my point of view

62
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,878
thanks travis

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,079
um i think to add to that

64
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,399
the international scene is not unified

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
yet you don't really have legislation

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,120
that is overarching where germany can do

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,439
easily business with the us for us

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,640
coming from the u.s side of things

69
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,000
exporting california or colorado buds to

70
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,559
germany is

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,639
very very far away on our legislative

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
map of i would say what like five to ten

73
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,159
years maybe something like that

74
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,479
so i think it kind of depends what

75
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,479
countries do individual trade deals with

76
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,399
each other and that will then kind of

77
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,318
lead to an international umbrella of

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
companies

79
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,399
anyone else want to add to that

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
yeah i think you're you're internet

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,158
start looking at how how you want to

82
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
play in this market so

83
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,280
if you're going to be somebody that's

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
going to be a large grower and you're

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,680
going to make a single product that is

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
going to be very good i always equate it

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,280
to like the brewery industry

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,920
if you're going to be a lager be the

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,560
lager you know make the same thing get

90
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,399
big at that and make a lot of it or if

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,479
you want to be a craft brewer which is

92
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,239
more of your craft mentality it there's

93
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,158
still a good market there's still good

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,319
market in the united states for that too

95
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,759
you have to be able to be very

96
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:28,798
innovative you have to have the right

97
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,199
brands

98
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,280
you have to go back just very similar in

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,598
touch with people that are in your area

100
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,280
very similar to a craft brewer and then

101
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,280
the third part third market a third

102
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,158
place that would really play at

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,598
is more nutraceutical pharmaceutical

104
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,280
products so there's a huge amount of

105
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,039
opportunities within this plant there's

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,799
over 120 different cannabinoids you've

107
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,519
got over 400 different terpenes there's

108
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,080
a lot of different things you can do

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,000
you'll find find what really makes the

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,760
niche that you can you can get into a

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,080
supplement or pharmaceutical find the

112
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,120
right partners and i would i would also

113
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,200
say you know

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080
you find people like the people on this

115
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,679
group

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
and start learning from them and figure

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
out what what are you good at what do

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,039
you want to do and start playing in that

119
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,039
space

120
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,519
yeah i think that's actually the most

121
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,000
important part to your point the

122
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,918
cannabis supply chain from cultivation

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,759
to what it becomes when you're

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,039
purchasing it in a store whether that's

125
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,080
a hash an edible pre-roll a flower a

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,759
tincture every one of those is produced

127
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,079
and processed by somebody who

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
specializes in that particular

129
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,399
particular

130
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,639
discipline so and and to add to your

131
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,638
point we're a very small san francisco

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,240
brand if you smoke cannabis in san

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
francisco there's a likeliness you

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,680
smoked some of our stuff outside of san

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,199
francisco probably just you know maybe a

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
few miles here and there because we're

137
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,360
really hyper local we focus on what the

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
san francisco smoker wants and that's

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,439
very high potency so everything that we

140
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
grow everything that we make really

141
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,600
caters to a high potency where i think

142
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,918
what you'll see in europe because it's

143
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800
more of a novice market and you have a

144
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,799
lot of the so-called canon curious that

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,520
you will probably to this point kind of

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,918
be very successful with nutraceuticals

147
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,879
with more approachable potencies that

148
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,599
are in the 18 to the 20 range so i think

149
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,680
europe will kind of find its own way and

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
its own preferences and cultivation as

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,879
the years go on i think alex can

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,120
probably speak a lot to the terpene

153
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,120
profiles that europeans enjoyed

154
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,758
when it comes to

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,199
well in europe we like about this of

156
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,080
course when it comes to the aromas that

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,720
we enjoy the aromas a lot the most cured

158
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,198
they are the more we are

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,199
lighting them

160
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,918
as to this

161
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,519
and timo what do you see as one of the

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,360
biggest light suppliers to cultivators

163
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,159
i'm sure you've seen plenty of really

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,840
state-of-the-art facilities um what do

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,680
you see the strain profiles that are

166
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,439
being run here and i'm sure you also

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
know what we run in california so you

168
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,839
have a pretty good idea of what the

169
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
taste in europe is versus

170
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,000
versus us

171
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,120
the question is do we know the taste of

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,478
europe right so europe is a huge it's a

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,038
continent and consumers are very very

174
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,120
different and with more choices also

175
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,120
their taste will develop

176
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,000
right now there are areas where there

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,160
are have not these choices now so still

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
taste and

179
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,800
you know demand

180
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,959
needs to still be developed um but i

181
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,000
i think it was a great discussion at the

182
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,599
beginning

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
when we see

184
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,479
you said something about focus

185
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,879
you know

186
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,000
we saw we learned from other markets

187
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,759
that a lot of

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,839
companies tried to be

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
everywhere

190
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,879
and that

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,800
really i mean everywhere at the same

192
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,120
time and then totally vertically

193
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,160
integrated you know from i do my own

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,079
genetics until extraction my own brand

195
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,479
distribution and so on

196
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,318
this is for every business independent

197
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,120
from cannabis

198
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,039
it's so complex so i think focus is

199
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,840
important where is your

200
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,240
play in the value chain and then

201
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,918
also what we easily said earlier

202
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,918
don't develop your own lines don't

203
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,240
develop your own rats don't

204
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,198
pick the things which work because then

205
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
you can

206
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,639
you know forecast and make a business

207
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,959
model in the business cape which is

208
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
fulfilling the customer demand what you

209
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,799
said you know what's my business one who

210
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,360
do i want to supply to

211
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
and i think this is um

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,639
interesting because we see all this

213
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,199
right now developing into different

214
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,680
countries in europe and

215
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,038
yes it's exciting times but for

216
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,759
entrepreneurs

217
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,318
the challenge is these times are totally

218
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,240
unclear when it's regulation coming here

219
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,360
when it's happening that and having the

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,400
agility in the business model to adopt

221
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
is i think

222
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,839
very interesting to see who will then be

223
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,598
successful because i think it will be

224
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,679
the ones who are able to adopt the

225
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,839
business model fast

226
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,598
yeah i think that's really on point to

227
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,519
add to that

228
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,839
the key thing there is pick your area of

229
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,279
expertise whether it's cultivation uh

230
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,119
whether it's manufacturing whether it's

231
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,679
packaging if you try to own them all

232
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,519
you'll be a master of none and

233
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,079
you know what we really see from working

234
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,000
based out of california and working in

235
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,680
the vertical growing space with many

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,759
cultivators who have been successful is

237
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,158
the ones who who've really excelled you

238
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,718
know companies like kirley verano

239
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,158
h medicine and steezy they really focus

240
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,320
on what they're good at and they didn't

241
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,158
try to make everything themselves like

242
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
to your point making your own lights or

243
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,278
racks yeah you could go that route but

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
you could be better off focusing on your

245
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,439
your own systems process to be first in

246
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,799
that given field

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,560
and also did i see it in our own company

248
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,799
you know we we did a lot of cannabis

249
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,518
lighting and then we decided oh let's go

250
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,319
also to europe and let's go do also much

251
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,799
more in you know food crops and the

252
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,278
complexity was like boom

253
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,479
so it's not like i experienced it every

254
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,360
day in our own company how hard it is so

255
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
focus is really for us as well because

256
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,879
it's

257
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,600
immediately you need to put new people

258
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,519
new um you know skill sets in the in the

259
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,320
company and then it gets really

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,720
difficult to scale and keep the focus

261
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,560
um so yeah

262
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
yeah and if you add to that that when

263
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,518
when you're in a new cannabis market

264
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,799
like germany or even you know markets

265
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,120
that that

266
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,240
legalize in the us the

267
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,000
states that do um if you do let's say a

268
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,278
processing place where you're just

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,440
processing

270
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,600
oils or making you know white label

271
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,360
stuff that will already generate you a

272
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,879
decent amount of business because to

273
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,560
this point there is going to be a lot of

274
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,240
growers that don't manufacture

275
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,159
themselves they're focused on

276
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,080
cultivating and they don't have brands

277
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,958
so they want somebody to buy their bulk

278
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,440
flour process that into products so

279
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,439
there is opportunities to

280
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,839
um to to

281
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,160
start facilities and just make money on

282
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,560
the square footage of that facility even

283
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,240
if you don't have a brand but to timo's

284
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,838
point you have to focus on one thing

285
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
you're good at are you going to make

286
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,519
creams and nutraceuticals are you going

287
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
to do pre-rolled joints but if you

288
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,959
become good at one thing your facility

289
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,120
will generate revenue

290
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,039
yeah i agree again i'd still equate it

291
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,639
back to you know any kind of craft

292
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,719
industry so

293
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,360
they're you know what there's 1500

294
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,440
different varieties or strings out there

295
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,360
if you try to do all 1500 you probably

296
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,120
won't get the customer base that you

297
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
want so your customers are going to be

298
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,799
after bothering me like hey you make the

299
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,799
best whatever so if it's crap brewer you

300
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,879
might say it's an imperial stout and

301
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,479
this might be a train wreck but these

302
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,720
are the guys i always go to i get the

303
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,039
best train wreck i get my best feeling

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,278
from that that's where i go they're my

305
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,199
guy and i'm willing to drive by five

306
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,200
other dispensaries to get to them

307
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
because that's my guy because what's

308
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
going to happen is there'll be

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
additional dispensaries and the people

310
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
that really are not connected with you

311
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,518
are going to go to the closest

312
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,519
dispensary and that's what you want to

313
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,519
employ

314
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,599
i think another question that was asked

315
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,359
was if um what we see happening to the

316
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,879
race to the bottom when it comes to

317
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,879
potency basically thc per milligram

318
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,720
whether it's going to become sort of a

319
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,360
brand war to sell you the most thc per

320
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,800
gram for the you know best price and i

321
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
think that's something that the whole

322
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,719
panel can speak to

323
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
um i'll start with with travis if you

324
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,959
want to

325
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,639
start that one we've seen it in

326
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,639
california so i think you have a little

327
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,319
bit of experience already

328
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,759
yeah definitely i mean it's besides like

329
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
the from the brand standpoint right

330
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,360
there's a few brands that have really

331
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,239
done it pretty well and i think that

332
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,600
they

333
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
they have they're doing all right in the

334
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
whole vertical chain but they're they

335
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
have experts who they brought in from

336
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,919
each thing they just tried to figure out

337
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,838
themselves because you know going back

338
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,519
to that point but i think the race to

339
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,480
the bottom is really going to come to

340
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,919
who

341
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
um if you look at the price per pound in

342
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,799
california it went from you know 2 000

343
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,360
to 800 right and if you're producing

344
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,799
pounds at 800 the whole time in the

345
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
beginning you thought you're making a

346
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,479
ton of money and all of a sudden you can

347
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,759
barely keep the doors open so i think if

348
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,320
you look at it from day one from a

349
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:25,039
cultivation standpoint how do i optimize

350
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,879
for as cheap as i can make it for at

351
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,000
still holding the quality level that is

352
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,919
you know important to you and your

353
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,240
customer whether that's to your point

354
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,838
you know the highest thc or the

355
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,159
smoothest for the entry-level uh

356
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,040
cannabis curious consumer um how do i

357
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,679
get to that 400 price point per pound to

358
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,120
grow so that when i'm making 2000 i'm

359
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,120
making even more and i can turn that

360
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,799
money and reinvest into my business but

361
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
when it gets down to 800 i'm still

362
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,519
profitable so process in any business

363
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,159
that you look at you know we fly planes

364
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,639
and naka wood don't crash very often

365
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,039
because we follow processes um that's a

366
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,399
very long-standing industry we have to

367
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,240
get to that point to where everybody is

368
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,440
following the same type of processes

369
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
internally

370
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,079
and you know at groveglide we looked at

371
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,160
that from a systems standpoint uh with a

372
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,078
cultivation kind of task overview and

373
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,919
some educational components that we're

374
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,359
working on internally but that's where i

375
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,120
see is a key thing

376
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,639
is don't focus

377
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,759
on how much money you're making now

378
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,039
focus on

379
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,439
where is it going to be in five years

380
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,240
and optimize for that day

381
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,880
yeah i totally agreed on processes um at

382
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,079
my manufacturing we've implemented

383
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,559
flourish which is a compliance and vrt

384
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,479
software and that even you know captures

385
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,559
our cost of goods on latex clubs or

386
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,360
whatever but what that's done for us

387
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,039
it's increased our output by 30 while

388
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,399
dropping our cost of goods like seven

389
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,399
percent but

390
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,958
you also see what kind of wastage you

391
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,600
have once you have systems in place that

392
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,198
actually track this so one tip that i

393
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,839
have for people that are starting a

394
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,639
cultivation is first of all look at the

395
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,880
time of the growth period of your

396
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,879
strains if you're running a 12-week

397
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,559
strain that is an extra month of rent

398
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,759
you have to pay where you're not

399
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,399
generating revenue so always keep a good

400
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,639
mix of 12 8 and 10 weeks straight so

401
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,278
that you're always harvesting and always

402
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,039
generating revenue so staggering you're

403
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,278
staggering to grow is something that's

404
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,000
really really important and the other

405
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,559
thing is really look to have to to

406
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,799
stuart's point the flavor profile maybe

407
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,638
it's not a super high potency one but it

408
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,399
has a really unique taste that people

409
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,120
really want so there's ways to

410
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,600
manipulate your catalog to also be

411
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,919
profitable not just for the love of oh i

412
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,199
want to grow this 12-week strain so you

413
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,198
have to you have to pick them well

414
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,958
so to the question of the race to the

415
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,560
bottom

416
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,879
um if we see

417
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,958
the sales price yeah there will be craft

418
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,360
growers there will be different business

419
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:56,159
ones you can play and maybe also sell

420
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,560
premium but the big volume

421
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,240
will be get under a lot of pressure

422
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,638
it will happen it's an agricultural

423
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,959
product it gets commoditized and it gets

424
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,000
the pressure will happen as it did for

425
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,078
tomatoes as it did for corn and whatever

426
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,839
um so it's i think

427
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:12,958
having the operational spendings under

428
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,880
control

429
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,559
and the two biggest blocks of your

430
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,958
operational spendings if it's a

431
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,879
greenhouse or indoor facility will be

432
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,799
labor and electricity

433
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,039
and labor goes down to processes

434
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,159
procedures and so on

435
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,719
being effectively you know i always like

436
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,719
also the example of if i go into a dutch

437
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,120
greenhouse

438
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,480
it's it's beautiful right it runs like a

439
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,360
perfect machine and

440
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,560
10 20 years ago they produced or

441
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,959
now the example of tomatoes 80 kilograms

442
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,799
sorry 40 kilograms and now

443
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,559
20 years later it's 80.

444
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,078
so they could increase the production by

445
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,078
100

446
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,198
and they thought back then they already

447
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,278
had it

448
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,519
totally under control right so where i

449
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,639
want to go with that is um

450
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,639
if the prices drop sales prices drop

451
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,198
then you need to preserve your gross

452
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,198
margin by having your opex under control

453
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,399
and that is electricity and this is

454
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:14,240
labor and these two things is important

455
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,039
and if we now go back to the example in

456
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,959
california the prices drop and everyone

457
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,759
who didn't have the opex under control

458
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,479
having for example hps lines yeah then

459
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,278
you have no operational income anymore

460
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,079
no gross profit and then you cannot um

461
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,480
survive right and to to the point with

462
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,319
matches i really like this we cannot

463
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,079
afford in europe really

464
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,839
i don't want that all the matches burn

465
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,479
through the end because we have the

466
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,199
opportunity to take learnings from other

467
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,759
market and do right so it's all

468
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,919
collectively our responsibility to not

469
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,839
repeat because actually we saw it

470
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,838
already so let's make it better

471
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,799
i think it's important to add though

472
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,679
that

473
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,799
in in the us there was always a lot of

474
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:03,519
30 40 year old existing industry that

475
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,759
had a say in what we had to do so you do

476
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,359
have a clean canvas and it is really

477
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,599
nice to have a clean canvas and we do

478
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,438
hope that germany takes from all the

479
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,198
different states that legalize them and

480
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,038
grabs the best of it that's definitely

481
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,079
the hope and i think stewart had

482
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,640
something yes i i 100 agree with with

483
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,399
with uh with what you're saying it said

484
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
you have to run it like a real business

485
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
it's not you're not just gonna go hey

486
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,000
i'm gonna i'm in the weed business and

487
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,400
i'm gonna get rich it doesn't really

488
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,519
work that way you have to work hard

489
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,440
and there's a lot of different ways to

490
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,440
do it so certainly you know labor

491
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,880
electricity you're going to look at a

492
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
return on investment you've had

493
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,760
financial model people talk to you

494
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
earlier

495
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,720
you're going to

496
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,558
you may have the cheapest operation but

497
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,919
if you're not getting yield that doesn't

498
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,160
make a lot of sense so you're going to

499
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,240
say i'm going to pay x amount to be able

500
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,120
to get x amount of yield and whatever

501
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,038
that number is also depends on

502
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,439
what you want to grow so product

503
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,279
selection is extremely important

504
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,120
branding you're going to have to brand

505
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,480
so you look at the companies there are

506
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,798
plenty of companies out there that are

507
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,960
commodities look at bananas anybody here

508
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,918
of chiquita bananas probably everyone

509
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
right

510
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,759
because why because they branded their

511
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,480
product it just isn't called bananas and

512
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,879
i'm a commodity and they demand more

513
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,240
money for that and so you've got to get

514
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
into the brand of discussion and then

515
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,480
there's a matter of innovations

516
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,400
and innovations certainly have a thc but

517
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,079
then you're going to add in

518
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
terpenes and terpenes to me are

519
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,558
extremely important i'm going to let

520
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,079
alex talk to that yeah but i'll have

521
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,759
nothing to add for the determinants of

522
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,519
the second what i'd like to say is that

523
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,759
we see here in europe when it comes to

524
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,519
the cbd business at the end a good

525
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,720
example of how it can go down and how

526
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,960
you can lose your money for your

527
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,200
investment because a few years ago the

528
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,600
price of the kilo price was still 4 000

529
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,038
euro and now you can buy the 200 euro

530
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,038
the cure

531
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,119
so you can see that even the investments

532
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,038
back for indoor facilities for cbd

533
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,639
flowers have been made in millions and

534
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,798
millions and millions

535
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,320
the roy nowadays is not given anymore

536
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,400
because the price has been dropped so

537
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,159
much because everybody started it

538
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,798
without giving any regulation for

539
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,558
nothing and everybody's just winging it

540
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,160
trying to bring the biggest proposal

541
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,319
trying to bring the biggest consultants

542
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,640
ranking the biggest investors trying to

543
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,918
build the biggest facilities and at the

544
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
end you have

545
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,679
bad outcomes the prices are dropping

546
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
it's too much and you will never get the

547
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
investment back at the end

548
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
so

549
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,080
let us try to make concrete how how if

550
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,400
we would have a magic wand and could say

551
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,079
okay how it should be germany to not

552
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,160
repeat the question how would we build

553
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,480
it let's let's let's discuss this

554
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,720
because i i i get asked

555
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,558
would you limit the amount of licenses

556
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,960
in germany

557
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,079
so then to to produce so that's pretty

558
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,480
question okay

559
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,038
do we produce only in germany or do we

560
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,960
can we get also import so

561
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,879
let us discuss what do we think should

562
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,279
germany it's a huge country over 80

563
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,200
million people should they supply their

564
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,200
own cannabis or should they allow as

565
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,798
well import what what do you guys think

566
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,960
about that i think i'd like to kind of

567
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,798
take the lead on that being that i can

568
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
still touch the plant every day and i've

569
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,279
been cultivating it for 20 years so i i

570
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,558
do take a little issue with saying that

571
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:16,240
it's a commodity um it's a part of it is

572
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:19,200
commoditized but when people spend 50 60

573
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,200
euros on you know five grams a week

574
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,519
that's a really nice wine bottle that

575
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,759
you could afford for that price and

576
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,558
grapes may be a commodity but wine is

577
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,759
not

578
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,319
so i think we really need to

579
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,279
differentiate and when we grow hemp we

580
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,759
can grow hemp like we grow corn we can't

581
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,000
grow cannabis like we grow corn cannabis

582
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,158
the footprint of an individual plant

583
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,319
takes space you need to care for it you

584
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
need to prune it it gets different it

585
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,519
gets a different regimen of food every

586
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:49,200
week of fertilizers it gets enzymes so

587
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,079
there's a lot of work that goes into

588
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,200
creating really good cannabis right so

589
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,678
it while it gets commoditized on like an

590
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,759
outdoor for we see the commoditization

591
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,679
in california without

592
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,279
outdoor wheat we don't see that on

593
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,798
indoor as much while the price has

594
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,879
dropped there's still a strong market

595
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,639
for it so i think to

596
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,440
transition to your point of what to do

597
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,720
in germany i think yes the wheat should

598
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,880
be grown locally that sold in germany so

599
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
you can foster small business

600
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,559
so you can give outdoor farmers the

601
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,960
chance to grow

602
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,440
a commodity but you give indoor farmers

603
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,200
a chance to be craft brewers and i think

604
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,240
that's aligned with the german culture

605
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,038
as well

606
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,640
but would you do it only

607
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:37,279
only in german germany for germany

608
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,600
i'm not i i'm for export but what i'm

609
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,240
saying the first right of refusal the

610
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,558
first right to grow cannabis should be

611
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,880
given to the locals but they should also

612
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,678
be allowed to export sure i mean i think

613
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,679
you can have a problem

614
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,880
with what you're saying i think you're

615
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,558
gonna have a problem on day one is that

616
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,799
demand is going to greatly outplay

617
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,960
supply right so what's best for the

618
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,519
transition period is is likely going to

619
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,079
be something where you have to allow

620
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,519
let's say 50 to be imported on year one

621
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,000
and then you could trail that down then

622
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,759
40 and then 30 10 20 all the way down to

623
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,839
10 i don't know that i would necessarily

624
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,919
agree that it should be zero uh is

625
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,599
allowed from import but something along

626
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,480
a transition period otherwise you're

627
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,719
just gonna have 10x the demand and if

628
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,159
you say there's no legal import it's

629
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,839
just going it's going to come in through

630
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,039
the black market right so i don't

631
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,359
disagree with that you need a

632
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,279
transitional strategy sure yeah and you

633
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,678
know i think the way that we that uh to

634
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,759
your point i to 100 agree i love the

635
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,600
brewery analogy you know there's in a in

636
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,038
america there's there's the budweiser

637
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,959
there's the coors you know there's only

638
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,759
a couple of those guys but that to the

639
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,679
equate that that's your your outdoor uh

640
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,599
grow quality is going to be low it's

641
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,600
going to be inexpensive but there are

642
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,519
hundreds and or thousands even of

643
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,000
flourishing micro breweries and craft

644
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,519
breweries who are looking at growing

645
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,038
their indoor space and they're not

646
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,279
trying to sell to the world they're

647
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,798
trying to sell to san francisco right

648
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,879
and they're putting out an amazing

649
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,798
product and i think that's why when you

650
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,400
go back to that operational efficiency

651
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,720
you know for us at groveland you know

652
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
multi-tier growing is crucial and if you

653
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,960
look at that from an offec standpoint

654
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,640
your first tier is going to cover your

655
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,919
labor costs your second tier coverage

656
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
your rent and your third tier is your

657
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,038
pure profit and that's really how a lot

658
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,399
of people are transitioning to they

659
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,000
learn how to grow in a single tour

660
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,120
outdoor but the ones who quickly

661
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,038
transition to a multi-tiered like very

662
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,879
uh process-driven environment are the

663
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,798
ones who are winning now so europe can

664
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
really look ahead and say like let's

665
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,960
skip the wasted time

666
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,319
to your point power and space is really

667
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,400
expensive and we talked about earlier in

668
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,158
the green room the cost of

669
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,798
transportation and supply chain you know

670
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,960
the the your to your point uh cannabis

671
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,879
is really old by the time it goes from

672
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,319
canada to here or wherever

673
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,440
and that's not really helping the

674
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,359
quality uh inconsistency versus if we

675
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,759
can grow it inside of berlin for

676
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,959
instance and supply just berlin that's

677
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,640
going to save on a lot of things

678
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,960
including you know benefits for the

679
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,559
environment

680
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,200
and i think it's important to say to

681
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,519
your point that a budweiser and a craft

682
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,840
brewer can't live next to each other and

683
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,679
both have a market the big brands

684
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,959
attract they attract attention they

685
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,038
attract awareness they bring in a ticket

686
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,880
price that's affordable across all tax

687
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,200
brackets and then you have your little

688
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,039
nice gems that you can pick from i think

689
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,600
it should be driven by getting the

690
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,798
consumers the freshest best product

691
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,918
whether that's from a commercial

692
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,440
industrial outfit or from a craft outfit

693
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,038
yeah completely green certainly i've

694
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
been on both sides of that with cure

695
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,839
leaf and uh and and small craft brewers

696
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,678
that are craft campus guys that we work

697
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,959
with today with agrippa

698
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,519
and it's really

699
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,640
it's it's it's really you know that

700
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,639
they work together but a large cara leaf

701
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
are large and you have like three large

702
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,880
ones within germany

703
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,360
those folks will help push regulations

704
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
those folks will bring and drive

705
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,000
process improvements so those folks are

706
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,600
bringing in product safety standards and

707
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,720
instead of having all these little guys

708
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,959
trying to spend

709
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,880
hundreds of thousands of dollars

710
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,558
let the big guys do that let them let

711
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,400
them pay it that way

712
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,918
and don't try to compete with it you

713
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
don't need to compete with unless you

714
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,880
unless you're the guy that runs around

715
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,639
here with two or three billion dollars

716
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,679
i'm guessing none of those people are in

717
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
this room

718
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,320
and

719
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
you're gonna go like how do i get how do

720
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,200
i get to the craft site so

721
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,278
you know

722
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,360
you know back to travis point you if you

723
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,679
do vertical grows you can do

724
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,399
you know they're they're a four by eight

725
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,798
section that's one strain

726
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,360
so you can do multiple strains within

727
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,960
your facility which are you know which

728
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,038
you can keep on getting your customers

729
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,679
more and more aware the new thing so

730
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,558
craft brew and large brewery is a very

731
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,080
good

732
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,839
it's a very good analogy and that's why

733
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,918
i would look at in as far as licenses as

734
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,119
far as limiting i wouldn't limit any

735
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,960
licenses

736
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,759
and i know that's not certain popular

737
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,240
but

738
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,119
i would limit the licenses based on you

739
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,599
have to hit a product safety and product

740
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,918
quality standard that's that should be

741
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,599
your only limitation

742
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,159
i agree and i think it's also important

743
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,558
to say that craft and commercial we

744
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,480
actually all use the very similar

745
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,960
equipment so for you when you walk into

746
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,120
industrial grow or you walk into my 200

747
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,960
lighters it's both fluent so it's

748
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,038
something that we all do use the same

749
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,038
equipment it's really just the intent

750
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,000
with which you approach your your

751
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,879
cultivation not all unfortunately but

752
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,720
we we try we try our best um

753
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,120
but but what i heard what we are all

754
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,278
saying i agree i would give license to

755
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,519
growers in germany for germany because

756
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,720
you can create great value propositions

757
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:42,400
and branding

758
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,319
here the brand brand book or berlin

759
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
cush or whatever you can make a nice

760
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,759
strain and you can label it and this is

761
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,599
yeah people want that they want to be

762
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,879
associated with their with their

763
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:55,918
community or region i i see that but i

764
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,600
totally agree we need to enable and

765
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,840
have in germany

766
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:05,119
import because we need so much weed

767
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,519
unbelievable to fight the black market

768
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,158
and where i'm from in bavaria

769
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,119
a lot of people are buying

770
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,278
cannabis

771
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,439
through the darknet and they are very

772
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,038
well educated consumers because if you

773
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,720
go into the darknet it looks like an

774
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,640
amazon store where you have all the

775
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,038
references and all the

776
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,919
customer reviews and so on so there must

777
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,398
be

778
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,320
volume and choice

779
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,558
because otherwise you just decriminalize

780
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,119
the drug everyone is still going to the

781
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,759
dealer and we don't achieve the goals

782
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,278
with the german government wants to

783
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,480
protect miners

784
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:43,278
to get tax income and to to ensure

785
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,599
product quality and safety these are the

786
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,759
three main targets for the government

787
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,398
this you don't have if you don't have

788
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,640
enough wheat and everyone is just buying

789
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,079
or less decriminalized from the dealer

790
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,919
and so i think

791
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,599
we need to have enough and i really like

792
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,919
this princess position

793
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:03,519
process of maybe phasing it slowly out

794
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,480
yeah to to to to support um you know

795
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,639
german

796
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,919
cultivators but we also need to be

797
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,038
clear on

798
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,320
electricity in germany is ridiculous

799
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,119
expensive

800
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,359
and this country is pretty crowded

801
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,158
already it's a tiny country with 80

802
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,558
million people so also permits and you

803
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,919
know growing facilities to build them up

804
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:31,278
is is expensive in germany so i i just

805
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,440
hope if germany gives regulation that

806
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,000
it's long term because if you cannot

807
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,759
make your money three three four five

808
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,359
six years but they change all of a

809
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,599
sudden you compete all of a sudden you

810
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,719
get cheaper cultivators for cheaper

811
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,240
prices

812
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
and then the business model is broken

813
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,720
again well one thing i can assure you

814
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,200
that's happened in every other state and

815
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,960
country that did legalize cannabis is

816
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,880
that you're nowhere looking at the near

817
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,480
the final legislation

818
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,559
it is that i can

819
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,159
i will put money on that the other thing

820
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,639
i do want to mention is to your point

821
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,320
with the black market um one thing that

822
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,000
i really feel like is lacking in the

823
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,879
german legislation

824
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,359
is an incentivizing people that have had

825
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,679
a record for selling cannabis and give

826
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,439
them a path to a legal industry and

827
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,759
there's no program for it they're not

828
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,840
considering it in their laws and that is

829
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,480
it's not fair towards those that risk

830
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,000
their freedom to make something socially

831
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,519
acceptable but it's also

832
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,679
counterproductive to your goal of

833
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,519
wanting to eliminate the black market i

834
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,600
would take every kid that's selling

835
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,359
eights on a corner and give him a bud

836
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,719
tender education because that kid to

837
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,839
your point will be a knowledgeable

838
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,900
salesperson so i do miss the restorative

839
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,119
and the social equity justice component

840
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,278
[Music]

841
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,278
in in the legislation that germany is

842
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,159
drafting and i wish they would put more

843
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,640
effort into that but do we know that

844
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,000
still i i don't think that we know how

845
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,840
they will change the btmg law because

846
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,319
they need to if you

847
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,278
legalize recreational cannabis you need

848
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,599
to also change how right now consuming

849
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,798
cannabis is punished

850
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,119
so that's

851
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,960
this i personally have no

852
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,558
view into but they will

853
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,079
need to change it because otherwise we

854
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,839
have conflicting

855
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,839
laws actually but what i'm saying is the

856
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,798
people of the past that have been

857
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,639
thinking

858
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,720
they need to be incentivized or the

859
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,038
people that are right now still dealing

860
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,360
in the illegal market you incentivize

861
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,919
those people look i was one of those

862
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,839
and the city incentivized me to come out

863
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,038
of all my basement out of the back of

864
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,359
the restaurant that i would get a

865
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,200
pre-record and they gave me a priority

866
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,719
permit what did that do i invested two

867
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,640
and a half million dollars into building

868
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,480
a business in the city so you have to

869
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,640
incentivize those to come out of the

870
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,240
underground and then you end up being

871
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,679
the chair of the oversight committee and

872
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,278
you have a voice and you have a voice

873
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,278
for people that didn't have a voice

874
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,480
before but we're also one of the best

875
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:52,079
manufacturers

876
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,159
our joints are the number one selling

877
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,240
joints because we really love what we do

878
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,919
right we risk our lives for it so i just

879
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,319
think the people that have had

880
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,720
convictions should have an opportunity

881
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,480
now that everybody says hey it's okay to

882
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,319
smoke weed why don't they get an

883
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,319
opportunity a first shot i did mystery

884
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
do we have do you have any more comments

885
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,240
because i think we were going to open up

886
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,720
some public questions too what i wanted

887
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,519
to add to chemo before was that why was

888
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,679
the big reason why you have people more

889
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,759
turned to black market against the black

890
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,960
market educate you better than any

891
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,079
pharmacist

892
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,159
just actually where you can get

893
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,839
information or i can get any kind of

894
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,760
knowledge about what you would be

895
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,439
growing how the bank would be for you

896
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,960
what kind of benefits you could have and

897
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,240
if you go to the pharmacy he will look

898
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,600
at you like

899
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,359
it could be this i don't know

900
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,599
you're absolutely right and

901
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,599
then that is why it's so interesting how

902
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,199
the point of sale looks like you know if

903
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,119
we would know how the point of sale

904
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,080
looks like we can also imagine how much

905
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,398
they can sell and what and who is

906
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,599
selling it and how much this person

907
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:06,239
knows to educate so this is like one of

908
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,798
the questions um which is yeah and

909
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,759
you're right we hope for people who are

910
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,200
in the cannabis industry today being the

911
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,278
people telling

912
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
possible consumers

913
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,359
what benefits they have because in most

914
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,840
cases they know it better than a

915
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,798
pharmacist at nothing against bonuses

916
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,879
and that's not the point but they are

917
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,440
have not been part of the industry so

918
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,880
far so there is also a learning curve to

919
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
to to take

920
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,519
yeah i think that part is it's it's the

921
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,000
black market's there it's it's not like

922
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,640
if we we act like we're gonna legalize

923
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,720
it and then there's gonna be weed

924
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,720
the weed is already there people have

925
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,558
been doing it for a long time

926
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,679
and all you have to do is basically say

927
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,359
now you can do it the right way

928
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,120
instead of all the other stuff that goes

929
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,959
on just take the people that already

930
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,798
know how to do this business

931
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,919
and give them a license just providing

932
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:59,440
that you they have to meet certain

933
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,960
regulations for sure without that we

934
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,960
don't want to hurt anybody

935
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,880
but just give the people that know how

936
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,200
to do this the chance to do it yeah

937
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,360
there's no bigger incentive than not

938
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,360
going to gym it's a great answer

939
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,119
[Applause]

940
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,639
um i think we should start with some

941
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,119
questions from the audience if you guys

942
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,120
have any

943
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,480
everything to you

944
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,159
no questions at all over there

945
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,759
straight to smoke session well we're

946
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,760
getting him a mic i think

947
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,079
while we're waiting to get a mic i think

948
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,720
you know everything we said about like

949
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,038
eradicating or getting towards a a

950
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,880
reduction in the black market is crucial

951
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,278
the one big caveat there is like going

952
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,399
to be the distribution right if it's if

953
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,079
it's

954
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,079
6 p.m on a friday and you and your

955
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,960
friends want to you know get some good

956
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,319
quality if you have to drive 25 miles

957
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,679
even if you're like i'm trying to

958
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,038
support the legal market you're like i'm

959
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,720
just going to call my dealer right so

960
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,119
there needs to be that distribution

961
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,038
market you know um

962
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,000
maybe amazon one day gets into drone

963
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,719
deliveries and i agree i think access is

964
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
like i was asked in san francisco why we

965
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,838
don't put a cap on retail licenses and i

966
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,480
said well everybody should be able to

967
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,320
walk to a dispensary within 10 minutes

968
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,398
so until we have three or four in every

969
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,599
neighborhood that's accessible we don't

970
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,358
have enough because look at how many

971
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,679
liquor stores look how many species we

972
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,358
have embedded right so why not we need

973
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,559
axes everywhere like to your point

974
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,878
shouldn't take you more than three

975
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,320
blocks to find a wheat shop

976
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,078
yeah but i guess you call the global

977
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,000
services and everything you just order

978
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,079
it or just eat in a few years and we'll

979
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,679
deliver it home and with convenience

980
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,119
yeah like we have ease and stuff they

981
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,838
deliver it's it's convenient

982
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,440
so um the question is

983
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:52,398
we're talking about

984
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,878
illicit versus legal market and one

985
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,679
category that feels completely not

986
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,920
talked about but widely used in germany

987
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,598
is hashish so

988
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,838
i'm curious to hear

989
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,800
what if any opinion you all have about

990
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,799
hashish and and how that will will or

991
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,720
could fit into this

992
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,760
you know new world

993
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,519
that's right

994
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,240
in my wheelhouse so we're the biggest

995
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,159
hashmaker in san francisco and have won

996
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,439
just several awards this month for our

997
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,239
temple balls

998
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,159
um

999
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,439
hashish is

1000
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,598
so culturally ingrained here in germany

1001
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,000
that i think what you'll see is an

1002
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,000
explosion in the market of rosins

1003
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,279
turp sauces diamonds traditional ash

1004
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,639
temple balls

1005
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,119
you'll see less and less of the

1006
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,440
so-called shoe hash

1007
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,000
kind of the the flattened the flattened

1008
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,720
hatch the way it gets here right now um

1009
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,679
but we see in california for example

1010
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:54,639
that hash is exploding so the last

1011
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:58,480
this 7 10 is you know the official hash

1012
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,639
holiday so 710 hash sales went up 70

1013
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,199
and then they've kind of flattened out

1014
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,358
but they're overall up now 30 to what

1015
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,000
they were before we see an incredible

1016
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,400
explosion in hash i think to go back to

1017
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,719
the point if i was making hash here i

1018
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,119
would definitely look into

1019
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,519
um into some you know

1020
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,680
local ethnicities and cultures that have

1021
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,239
that ingrained imagine i could find a

1022
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,480
hell of a lebanese hashmaker here so i

1023
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,719
think cash will be a part where john

1024
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,559
germany can really dominate some of the

1025
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:33,519
markets but it will be so hard to push

1026
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:36,159
away the illegal market it's like i

1027
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:39,358
cannot even imagine it so we what we

1028
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:42,319
feel about hashes we love it and

1029
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:45,440
we get great hashish from morocco from

1030
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:49,200
lebanese from afghanistan and they do it

1031
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,599
in massive fields and do amazing hashes

1032
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,919
it will be brutally difficult to push

1033
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,240
this away for a good price point because

1034
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,079
quality is good and

1035
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,598
but here

1036
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,880
the politicians have an interest because

1037
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,200
this is a

1038
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,838
product where potentially

1039
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,519
and the quality could be

1040
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,759
somehow

1041
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,679
changed because you can mix easier stuff

1042
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,599
in there than on flower

1043
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,598
so there is a big interest to push away

1044
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,920
the illegal market but it will be tough

1045
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,200
i think it will be very very tough to to

1046
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,039
push it away but um who cares and finds

1047
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,039
her in a sweet spot yeah

1048
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,800
a lot of consumer wants that for sure

1049
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,800
and i think once you see a tested

1050
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,560
product with a lab test

1051
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,880
and then you see one that's not tested

1052
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,559
and you see what they test for you're

1053
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,480
probably going to go with the tested

1054
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,639
product and to this point yes they make

1055
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,559
good land raise techniques but you're

1056
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,719
not going to get a butter or a rosin

1057
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,239
that's like bright yellow or white from

1058
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,639
them right you're not going to get a

1059
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,199
sauce that pulls a spaghetti into your

1060
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,358
dab break so yeah you'll you'll have

1061
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,118
your choices but he's right you have

1062
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,759
you're spoiled with really good street

1063
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,079
cash here that is an issue but it's also

1064
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,280
often contaminated that is a that is the

1065
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,920
issue but

1066
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,720
who is not saying that maybe morocco is

1067
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,920
changing the laws it's a sleeping giant

1068
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,279
who could also

1069
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,440
change the law and if germany have a

1070
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,760
bilateral agreement with morocco it

1071
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,960
could be also that then it gets imported

1072
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,200
i was

1073
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,679
not not something that is not

1074
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,679
potentially possible right the real

1075
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,759
optimist this one i would have said in a

1076
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,598
real bright future maybe we have

1077
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,520
cultivation licenses in morocco and we

1078
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,200
can export an important actual real

1079
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,759
hardship but legal this time for

1080
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,439
moroccan we can serve it everywhere

1081
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
there you go

1082
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,159
let's keep on dreaming does that answer

1083
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,159
your questions a little bit

1084
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,640
if you have any other questions

1085
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,599
all right let's hear it from the panel

1086
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,599
all right thank you
