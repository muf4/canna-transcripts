1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,460
on the my left side you see sites from

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,609
pharmacy looks no no no in sick which is

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,250
a pharmacy which is concentrating very

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,528
much on cannabis medicine cannabis

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,309
patients a good source of information

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:24,240
for us every time it's about pharmacy

7
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:27,419
issues then we've got to have it Hin

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:32,129
from Cana medical claiming to be the

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:35,130
biggest importer in Germany for medical

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,980
flowers he can tell you more about that

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,000
later and we have challeng a cleanse

12
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:45,628
from Budokan which was for me just a few

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,558
years ago mr. cannabis Europe or

14
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:52,349
something like that if that few time ago

15
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:56,429
we had only be talk on in our pharmacies

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,160
nothing else so this is nice too for me

17
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:01,649
to have them here let me just give a

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,039
very little short introduction what we

19
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:08,159
are talking about here when it's about

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,770
imports because that is not the same as

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,400
talking about the German market you hear

22
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:18,048
more about that later when you have the

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,880
German market you have several different

24
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:24,540
products and a big proportion of this

25
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:28,769
market is not flowers it's gonna be

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,829
Newell pure THC product maybe about

27
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:34,728
about one third of the market there are

28
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:38,279
no will clear numbers and statistics

29
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:42,930
there and there is kind of monopoly a

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:46,560
German company doing that and then we

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,860
have big proportion of sativex also kind

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,680
of monopolies from Great Britain you

33
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,680
know that and here we are talking about

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,960
the rest of the market mainly flowers my

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,618
bet is about 40 percent maybe a little

36
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:04,828
bit more and a growing number but small

37
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:08,459
but growing extracts that's what we are

38
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:10,978
talking about here this is kind of quite

39
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,159
a free market with many producers many

40
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,290
importers

41
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,270
and well so that's fun that's the

42
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,849
playground for everybody here more or

43
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,490
less and that's that with that on the

44
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:25,969
front on the counter of the pharmacies

45
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,830
giving Adam the question what kind of

46
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:32,740
products do you have there and the

47
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:37,610
pharmacies and what about the proportion

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:43,460
you sell there in your pharmacy thank

49
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,860
you hi everyone so one I'm just

50
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,560
following up on your on your first at

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,830
about dronabinol and the synthetic THC

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,319
so you have to differentiate those from

53
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,660
the from the flows and the number you

54
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,439
just mentioned 60% of the market yes

55
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:02,949
it's a it's a narcotic drug that's has

56
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:06,259
been described since the nineties and

57
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:09,109
those numbers are accurate since it's a

58
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:11,569
simple drug and it's easy to understand

59
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:16,220
for physicians and this is why they

60
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:21,650
prefer to prescribe that also the public

61
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:24,709
insurance cover their costs if only

62
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:28,010
cover the cost of having a medical

63
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,650
cannabis therapy if there was also a

64
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:34,310
therapy with journal you know that has

65
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,650
been failed so this is why those number

66
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,659
that high in a final pharmacy we are

67
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:44,120
specialized in medical cannabis and in

68
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:46,819
the flows we sell about 55 to seven

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,060
strains from the Netherlands and around

70
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:58,629
25 strains are being imported from

71
00:03:50,060 --> 00:04:02,780
Canada so we can confirm that number we

72
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:06,500
provided extracts very less than sixty

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:10,580
percent to our patients in the last year

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,939
but it's definitely it's definitely

75
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:21,949
interesting what the extracts are

76
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:24,379
holding us and horse also mentioned

77
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,339
already in the prescription of this

78
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:30,409
panel is the

79
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:32,969
problem of bottlenecks what about that

80
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,610
what is available what's not available

81
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,000
in your pharmacy and everywhere else in

82
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,699
Germany yeah so yeah the bottlenecks are

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,860
huge actually

84
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:48,240
so the pharmacy that's it's quite

85
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,129
challenging actually it's you provide

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,199
all sort of medical cannabis that are

87
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:56,009
available in Germany for the patient

88
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,509
because there is no source there's no

89
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,439
source where we could get the

90
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:04,079
information which trains are available

91
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,439
right now so as a pharmacy you have to

92
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:12,589
go and ask what you can what you can

93
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:17,730
deliver and the bottlenecks also mean

94
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:22,739
that if you are not well prepared if you

95
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:25,980
don't have a huge amount of cannabis on

96
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,900
stock that you're most probably not able

97
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:34,590
to provide the medication to the

98
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:36,179
patients so you mostly have to say no to

99
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:38,849
your patients and the patients in need

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,360
to find a pharmacy because as you know

101
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:46,979
the prescription for narcotic drugs it's

102
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,680
only available only you have only 7 days

103
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:54,300
just to redeem that prescription so the

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:58,139
patients are definitely patients have

105
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,689
definitely a huge problem with that so

106
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,649
what we are trying to solve is to

107
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:06,509
provide the information what exact

108
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:09,000
strains are available right now

109
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,819
on the German market in order for the

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,629
patient as for and for the doctor to

111
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:20,339
know where to go with the prescription

112
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:24,300
what to prescribe other other than that

113
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:26,609
just one more touch to it from the

114
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,860
pharmacy perspective it's very important

115
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,100
to provide a patient that medical meant

116
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,590
just to follow up on their medication so

117
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,770
you if you can provide the same

118
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:39,529
medication once it has been used up then

119
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:42,819
you're not following on exact

120
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:46,219
and this is quite huge

121
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:50,240
so once the strain is prescribed and in

122
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,880
two weeks it's out of stock then either

123
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,199
the doctor or the patients but mostly

124
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:59,199
the doctor has to look for another

125
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:02,870
another sort of strain that sometimes it

126
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,899
has a different effect mostly not

127
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,759
sometimes all right so this is slowing

128
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:11,209
down the development we are talking

129
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,139
about three tons of flowers last year

130
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:18,469
what my bet is fifty to sixty thousand

131
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:22,219
patients used last year could have been

132
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:24,980
much more if we had will good supply so

133
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,400
what the hell is going on we Germans are

134
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,610
not able to grow our own obviously at

135
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,189
least we need lots of time to get it on

136
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:38,800
the road and we are begging the world

137
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:42,319
give us your baths and we don't get it

138
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,990
especially we see those bottlenecks and

139
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,139
problems from Canada so my next question

140
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,410
- David what's going on you are also

141
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:53,779
problems importing from Canada right

142
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,210
what is the problem why does it not come

143
00:07:53,779 --> 00:08:00,978
and is this problem going to solve in

144
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:03,049
the next future hello thanks gr4 for the

145
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:04,550
introduction just one more thing to add

146
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,530
I said we're the biggest independent

147
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,280
importer Germany maybe this is a little

148
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:12,529
detail but significant so what is

149
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:17,659
happening in Canada would we mainly see

150
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:19,759
two things is we are there's a lot of

151
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,130
facilities there's really really big

152
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,589
facilities that are going to produce

153
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,060
lots of quantities that is your mark and

154
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,279
reserved for Germany for the some fact

155
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,780
that they can generate a higher yield

156
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,750
when they sell to Europe other than in

157
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:34,939
Canada but let's not forget that Canada

158
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,418
has just opened up in October the

159
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,010
recreational market so and the second

160
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,779
impact is let's not forget most of these

161
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:45,409
Co of these companies that are supplying

162
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:47,419
medical cannabis are public companies so

163
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:51,289
what they did is they entered in lots of

164
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:52,750
bankable agreements but as provinces to

165
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,269
supply those provinces and

166
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,039
lots of them were over-promising at the

167
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,809
time they were executing this contrast

168
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,240
and they were fully aware of this but

169
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:03,279
they were literally pouring to have new

170
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,340
facilities up and running online being

171
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,309
fully certified being obtaining in a

172
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,889
cultivation or sales license just some

173
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:14,079
time that simply did not happen and we

174
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,909
were one of the one of the importers

175
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,040
that actually got hit by this with a

176
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:20,620
full effect because last year when I was

177
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:22,360
here was telling lots about a new

178
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,600
supplier that we have helped obtaining

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,250
the huge impe status so we did this we

180
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,159
have we we kept our word but what

181
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,169
happened was the next thing is we got

182
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,779
into some political conflict with the

183
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:37,389
suppliers so we were no longer able to

184
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,339
import from this producer given the

185
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:41,649
German narcotic regulations and

186
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,560
pharmaceutical regulation obtaining

187
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:48,459
getting a new supplier Aug P Reddy takes

188
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,609
us or roughly 150 to 180 days so there's

189
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,400
lots of things coming and there's where

190
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,430
we're actually just waiting for an

191
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,909
export permit for from Health Canada to

192
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:03,219
have new kind of medical varieties on

193
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:06,189
the market it's let's say three to four

194
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,370
weeks they are fully packaged you are

195
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,190
laying in stock in Canada but at the end

196
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,250
of the day at the end of the day there

197
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:18,520
is still lots of problems going on in

198
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,820
Canada with the ability to close this

199
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,449
gap for a constant supply but I'm very

200
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:28,660
hopefully four actually q3 q4 that those

201
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,520
gap will get much much better due to the

202
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:32,199
fact that a lot of these giga facilities

203
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,699
are coming online I've been in Canada

204
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,040
last week so Monday to to Wednesday and

205
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,940
I've seen a scene a few facilities and

206
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,799
I'm truly confident and hopeful that

207
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,520
those Giga facilities that can actually

208
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:51,370
use a 50 50 50 to 60 thousand kilograms

209
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,699
a year will have a very positive impact

210
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:57,850
and then there is a second side this is

211
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,339
also affecting challon's company is we

212
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,889
would love to import more from from the

213
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,589
Netherlands but the way the Netherlands

214
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,039
is selling you to the MC is really

215
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,290
making

216
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,088
a tough life for the simple fact that we

217
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,879
have a fixed amount that is going to

218
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:16,600
Germany on a monthly basis this amount

219
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:19,919
is divided by the amount of growing

220
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,870
importers equally mostly equally and

221
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:26,110
technically kinematical iself has about

222
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:29,019
200 to 300 kilos on pre-orders a month

223
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:33,940
that we cannot serve at the moment all

224
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:38,110
right that leads to the question which

225
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:43,170
other countries could provide our needs

226
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:47,500
here and also leads to challeng and that

227
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:50,049
may be in the first thought unusual idea

228
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,409
of the Netherlands government giving a

229
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:56,139
limit to the exports there's a funny

230
00:11:53,409 --> 00:12:00,219
story going on maybe you can tell us if

231
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:03,009
that is right the limit you could

232
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:06,490
provide to Germany was much lower until

233
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:09,879
I think summer 2018 and then our Health

234
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:12,129
Ministry Minister in Japan was phone

235
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,649
calling Pennock Lee the Netherlands

236
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:18,250
government to give us more lift the

237
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:21,879
limit is that story right and now is the

238
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,610
story going on thank you

239
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,509
I don't know if the story is wrong that

240
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,709
that in the first place

241
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:31,328
I won't I wasn't there so I know that

242
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,068
there have been requests on the

243
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:36,519
political level that's where that's

244
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:38,078
where the whole thing is is it's

245
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,269
basically playing that's the playing

246
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,568
field in Europe it's on a political and

247
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,679
regulatory level most of the times

248
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:46,689
dealing with regulatory organizations

249
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,549
dealing with governments dealing with

250
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,220
controlled substances does mean in

251
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:55,028
Europe especially that it's debts have

252
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,000
fully locked in markets we have been

253
00:12:55,028 --> 00:13:00,278
operating in this market since 2003 the

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,250
first 10 years not so much happened from

255
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:05,649
2008 we started exporting very little

256
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,269
amounts to Germany Italy few other

257
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:12,240
European countries and that's where it

258
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:14,429
all started and where the OMC the Dutch

259
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,009
regulatory office that is responsible

260
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:19,449
for keeping the monopoly on the trading

261
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,429
cannabis I

262
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,170
to emphasize that because the trade in

263
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,729
Europe will not be in the hands of

264
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,219
individual companies if you talk in

265
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,190
cannabis flour it will be in the hands

266
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,990
of the regulatory organizations that are

267
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,580
appointed by their government so in

268
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,029
Germany we have beef farm and all we

269
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,730
have the OMC doing that and at some

270
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:42,490
point I think it was about eight or nine

271
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,470
years ago the Dutch government was kind

272
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,970
of swamped with requests from all over

273
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,279
the world including Israel they were

274
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,420
asking metric tons of product and

275
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,459
basically we were the only company at

276
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:57,370
that time and we in that time we were

277
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,509
producing only maybe 200 kilos a year so

278
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:04,389
those requests could not be fulfilled

279
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,549
but the Dutch government had in in the

280
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:09,460
my in in in in the back of their mind

281
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:11,379
obviously they don't want to

282
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,420
disadvantage anybody who was coming to

283
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,179
ask for product is so they start

284
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,559
dividing product in portions say you can

285
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,329
get a little bit of this and you can get

286
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:22,359
a little bit of that and it was kind of

287
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:26,410
depending on our ability to expand and

288
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,860
also to the word the change we saw in

289
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:31,480
the world of the last four or five years

290
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,570
that actually also changed this whole

291
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,909
situation so we were able at some point

292
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,820
and it started back in 2013 I think we

293
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:42,129
were able to expand we expanded till up

294
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,100
until now three times we came from a

295
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:47,769
level of 200 kilos annual annually where

296
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,050
we where we were in 2012 we are now at

297
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:53,199
5,000 kilos annual and we will grow

298
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:55,599
quickly now this year doubling almost

299
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,930
those number go to 9 metric tons a year

300
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,180
and we have plans beyond that but again

301
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:03,370
we are we are trying to keep up a demand

302
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:07,179
and and that's another thing the demand

303
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,590
the demand is not just coming up right

304
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:12,219
now the demand has there been for

305
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:14,290
decades already basically however and as

306
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,750
I said in the beginning regulatory and

307
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:22,360
political hurdles and thresholds kept

308
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:26,200
patients away from a legal system so we

309
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,550
had this huge illicit system and we

310
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,550
still see it in the Netherlands with the

311
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:33,278
coffee shops where the product being

312
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:34,809
sold through the pharmacy is in sick

313
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,169
significant to what is being sold in

314
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:40,268
coffee shops but that's illegal product

315
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:43,990
but we also see do see a lot of patients

316
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:45,909
appear in that coffee shop still that's

317
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,769
a situation you don't have in Germany so

318
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:49,929
now the market is opening up in Germany

319
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:50,589
you see patients flooding into the

320
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:52,599
system

321
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,509
of course the reimbursement thing is

322
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,649
there that's another important thing and

323
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:02,470
an important feature that the the German

324
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,759
situation now supplies to patients and

325
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,439
that's very good

326
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,629
we had reimbursement in the Netherlands

327
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:09,099
it it has been taken away again due to

328
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:11,019
lack of effort of scientific evidence

329
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,909
it's always the same thing

330
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:15,818
although we know that there is a lot of

331
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:18,100
scientific evidence but still that's

332
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:20,110
another discussion that we that we also

333
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,850
need to have on a regulatory level but

334
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,649
that is basically how this situation

335
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,449
evolves and where we are right now to

336
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:30,909
make a long story short alright maybe

337
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:33,849
back to that issue you are able to

338
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:37,929
produce more quite soon will the Dutch

339
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:41,379
government and their own sea lift up the

340
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:47,049
limit also will more battle can hit the

341
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:49,120
German pharmacies next year okay it's a

342
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:51,308
number of questions in one question so

343
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,600
the question with regard to the do the

344
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:58,568
OSI and and and politicians lifting that

345
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,850
ban on on sales that is a question for

346
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,500
them to respond to so I'm not a

347
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,279
government I'm just the company

348
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:09,250
delivering to them but I can tell that

349
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:12,750
the situation is changing the mindset is

350
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:17,140
changing also in the Netherlands and the

351
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:20,288
the fear we that initially was there 10

352
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:23,380
years ago like Oh Holland will be you

353
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:26,259
know it will be all over the papers that

354
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,510
Holland is exporting truckloads of

355
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:29,890
cannabis into Germany that was a

356
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:32,619
political thing a little bit at that

357
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,230
time and we see that now fading because

358
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:38,229
cannabis is being taken seriously also

359
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,679
also in how long but we have to we have

360
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,779
to get over the regulatory issues we

361
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,548
also see in Germany if you look at the

362
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,869
German tender how much product is being

363
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:49,029
asked for

364
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:52,509
and kilos how much did you sell in the

365
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:54,308
last whatever you know it's debt is

366
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:56,650
already too little so the the import

367
00:17:54,308 --> 00:18:00,480
situation is there to stay for a while

368
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:03,970
I'm pretty sure and it will be difficult

369
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,910
again as David already pointed to the

370
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,730
Canadian issues are real issues too they

371
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,700
are also not able to just export freely

372
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,690
and do whatever they like in that regard

373
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,650
well that's perfect for my next question

374
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:22,840
what are the countries could provide

375
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:26,650
there are lots of countries coming up

376
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:29,470
right now the regulation is that country

377
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:34,530
must have an cannabis agency it must

378
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:37,600
meet the European GMP production and it

379
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:40,779
well it in a case like egg white must

380
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:43,480
have a divided system of providing in

381
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:47,200
their country to the medical and the

382
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,160
recreational market that quite Auto

383
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,410
Detail we allowed to import from Canada

384
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,050
with recreational market but not from AG

385
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,480
why because they sell recreational in

386
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:02,409
the pharmacies but other countries will

387
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,929
meet those regulations quite soon ECL I

388
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:08,370
am quite sure is coming up on the market

389
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:11,860
this year then we have attempts from

390
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:14,229
Jamaica maybe Australia in a lot of

391
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:18,879
European countries like Denmark Poland

392
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:21,308
gooeys Macedonia they are all opening up

393
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,420
facilities now so in two years we might

394
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:30,099
have 10 countries providing and 20

395
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:32,460
companies or 30 or whatever dabit what

396
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:36,789
do you think do you think we have 5

397
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:39,819
countries providing in a year and if you

398
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:43,029
got plants are you talking to produce us

399
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:46,649
in those countries what is your bet how

400
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:48,940
it's going on yes thanks for asking so

401
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,250
there is a few things that we have done

402
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,690
in some of them are public my heart is

403
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,099
gas right now is Australia for the

404
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,890
simple reason that they have a very

405
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,289
similar pharmaceutical system as we used

406
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:04,060
to have in Germany and also in

407
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:06,339
in Europe so on top of it they follow

408
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:09,220
the same strict rules we have an MRA in

409
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:11,470
place that allows us to you're released

410
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,809
as in Australia this is very comfortable

411
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,930
details that are coming in here they

412
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:19,210
have great Sun they have stable

413
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,970
political environment so I truly believe

414
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,730
Australia will have a very good role in

415
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,400
supplying Germany and the next time I

416
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,890
don't see Macedonia being that hot for

417
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,390
the simple reason that they let's not

418
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,460
forget they have not even open up their

419
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,110
exports so we're simply talking about

420
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,720
something hypothetical that could happen

421
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:41,379
I know it's very overhyped right now but

422
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,019
let's stick to details I know that lots

423
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,620
of things are going on in in Denmark and

424
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:49,119
also in in southern Europe Denmark I'd

425
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,069
be honest I don't really happen to have

426
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,689
an opinion right now for the surgery I

427
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:55,990
know that lots of these big companies

428
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,370
went to that are also participating in

429
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,799
the German market some of the big names

430
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:01,569
are actually running setting over

431
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,669
facility mostly rates but it will fit

432
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:05,470
facilities but up today there is no

433
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:11,710
facility in Denmark at least I know of

434
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:13,779
that is fully up and running I would

435
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,000
love to see that we have the ability to

436
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:17,019
actually grow in Germany also I agree

437
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,869
with you

438
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:23,889
we made multiple requests with a German

439
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:26,649
beef farm even to increase volumes

440
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,390
because 10 tonnes that is currently on

441
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,890
the tender well way not be sufficient

442
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,230
kind of medical loan is wholly supply

443
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,080
agreements for over 25 thousand kilos by

444
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,140
now for the next 36 month just to give

445
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:39,460
you an idea where only one importer on

446
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,550
the German market and we're very very

447
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,200
very confident that we can solve this

448
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,359
very very easy thing if that actually

449
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:51,789
reaches the standard that is there's

450
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:56,639
requested all right let's stick a little

451
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:59,710
bit to this explosion of people

452
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:05,500
companies taking part in that market

453
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:08,769
maybe again to David we at the German

454
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:12,680
cannabis age Association count 21

455
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:16,829
importing companies right now

456
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:20,850
more to come probably people seeking for

457
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:23,699
making fast money what do you think how

458
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:26,129
is this going to develop will it become

459
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,950
more will it be more in a year will it

460
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:31,850
be less than a year who will get through

461
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:37,410
who will get problems what do you think

462
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:40,049
well I'm also aware of this because we

463
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,790
see that a lot of these companies or are

464
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:45,149
coming especially in the last six to

465
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:47,730
nine months and it seems to be a trend

466
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,730
for people to tend to believe that it's

467
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,200
very easy quick money but this is a

468
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,990
complete wrong approach in my opinion

469
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,529
this industry is not a place for

470
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:02,009
amateurs and due to the fact how

471
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:07,019
difficult German regulations are or ugp

472
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:09,089
regulations I know that there will be a

473
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,160
big earthquake in the industry coming in

474
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,299
the next few months from what we have

475
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,279
heard what is happening with the beef

476
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:17,839
farm they are also look into it quite

477
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,839
carefully but just to give some examples

478
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:27,000
the way product is imported to Germany

479
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,459
right now is far of the regulation it's

480
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,140
a very you know challenge used to call

481
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:36,240
this a Wild West and he might be true

482
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:38,790
some I said it there is a very good

483
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,440
chance that by the time the first player

484
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:43,170
in this industry and I will make sure

485
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,660
kinematical this player will do it

486
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,320
correctly and what she completely live

487
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,090
the the regulations that we do today

488
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,029
that are in complying with the with the

489
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:57,149
mg regulatory there will be a very hard

490
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,769
time for a lot of these there are lots

491
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,750
of these newcomer first of all they

492
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:02,160
don't understand the regulatory second

493
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,589
they are completely under financed and

494
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,450
third is laws of them or technically

495
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:09,599
only bill to be acquired by chemicals

496
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:14,640
and then on the other hand you are leaks

497
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,569
by example for the people being startup

498
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,200
you're on your own

499
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:21,629
yourself just a few years ago and being

500
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,480
very successful and also others becoming

501
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,500
millionaires and a short time so it will

502
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,049
stay a little bit by

503
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:31,859
and some of them will get through some

504
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:34,169
won't but all of these more exporting

505
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:36,389
countries many more producers coming

506
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:39,539
into the game lots of importers will

507
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:42,270
also lead to a huge variety in the

508
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:45,289
pharmacies of several products we

509
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:49,589
already have a big variety but then

510
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:52,859
imagine we might have 100 150 200

511
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:55,829
different kinds and sorts of medical

512
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:58,229
cannabis in the pharmacies so my

513
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:00,449
question to Adam what do you think what

514
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:04,589
outcome will that have would that be

515
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:08,069
good or not what do you think yeah just

516
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:09,389
to give a short answer variety in the

517
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:12,799
pharmacy is always welcome

518
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:16,460
so it's good to have many sort of

519
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:21,359
medical cannabis strains in the pharmacy

520
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:24,240
but there is another way to look at this

521
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:29,929
from the pharmacy pharmacist perspective

522
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:33,299
which is how those trains differentiate

523
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:35,640
themselves from another so how those

524
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:39,059
strains are different from another and

525
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,280
who's telling whom those informations

526
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,929
and those differences on the German

527
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,539
market so this should be the physician

528
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:49,110
that as there is aware of all the

529
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:53,879
differences from those strains and today

530
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:57,179
on today's market is not the case so

531
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,900
it's still the number number is getting

532
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:03,330
better that I must admit but there's

533
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,720
still the patients that no more than the

534
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:11,429
physicians and it shouldn't be shouldn't

535
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,799
be the case so also if you if you have

536
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,960
many strains on stock in the pharmacy

537
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:19,470
you have a very big logistic problems

538
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,500
you know as narcotic drugs it has it's

539
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:25,769
it furs under different regulatory

540
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,940
regulatory issues in the pharmacy then

541
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:32,700
and just simple ot C's and this is quite

542
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,650
a big problem for for pharmacies there

543
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,480
are not specialized in medical cannabis

544
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,610
yes keep in mind that it's not

545
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,730
like in the States or in Canada where

546
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:48,419
you get your recipe and as a patient go

547
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:53,240
to dispensary and enjoy to choose out of

548
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:59,160
200 varieties the doctor has to do it

549
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:02,519
and decide which one single kind I put

550
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,830
on the recipe and then it doesn't help

551
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:09,829
if there are lots of grains not

552
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:12,839
available and it's confusing the doctors

553
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:19,139
they are most of them are not able to

554
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:24,839
really say which is the right choice so

555
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:29,940
we'll see where that leads to I would

556
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:32,429
like to go on one last issue before we

557
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:38,070
open up for questions time is running

558
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:41,549
it's about extracts the first to extract

559
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:44,490
hit the market last year I think at the

560
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:48,329
moment it's quite a small proportion but

561
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:54,359
there's also a second extract coming up

562
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:57,179
now and probably this is the future my

563
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:00,089
question to every one of you asking for

564
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,850
short answer starting with challeng what

565
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:07,079
are your plans I was sticking to flowers

566
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:08,939
or planning extracts the the flower is

567
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,779
the basis or everything we all know that

568
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,549
so that's that's what we now call API

569
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:16,200
the active pharmaceutical ingredient or

570
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:20,579
the raw material you are using to make

571
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:24,140
extracts are we we have been in fully

572
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:27,359
into producing flower first we are

573
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:30,420
getting into next steps where we want to

574
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:34,409
actually extract in the product get into

575
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:38,850
standardized extracts from the raw

576
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:40,259
flower but that will still be an API is

577
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:43,919
it will still be an active

578
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:45,390
pharmaceutical ingredients Europe in the

579
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,550
end will require medicines true

580
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:51,230
medicines registered the medicines

581
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:53,750
clinically based on clinical research

582
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,549
you have a you have a proper outcome if

583
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,619
you want to use this right you're an

584
00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:01,039
extract from that from this typical

585
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:03,019
variety currently everything in the

586
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,210
German pharmacy also and correct me if

587
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:07,099
I'm wrong is happening under the rules

588
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,759
and regulations of compounding pharmacy

589
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:12,619
so it's actually the product has to be

590
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,170
kind of made in the pharmacy itself

591
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,879
either by labeling by weighing it or by

592
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,480
even extracting it it's something we see

593
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,030
in Holland happening also the difficulty

594
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,069
of making extracts from a regulatory

595
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,509
perspective again is that you're dealing

596
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:29,240
with a controlled substance and it has

597
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:30,740
to turn into a medicine in Europe that

598
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,660
is what we see happening in Australia by

599
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,940
the way so in Australia where things are

600
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,290
moving very slowly but that's due to the

601
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,029
fact that they have to develop real

602
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,940
medicines and do their clinical work on

603
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:42,200
it it's a path we have chosen in Holland

604
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,519
now as well we have done our first

605
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,590
clinical studies on flour that is

606
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,839
helpful because it allows flour also to

607
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:54,169
be in the market and to stay there but

608
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:56,449
in the next step will be to come up with

609
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,430
more defined products in the world in

610
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,130
the field of extracts etc but you need

611
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,690
to be very aware that you cannot do that

612
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,120
in the barn behind your house you need

613
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:09,740
true pharmaceutical lab with under

614
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:11,899
certain certificates quality

615
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,240
certificates etc need to be in place in

616
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:18,560
order to be able to do that and that's a

617
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:24,859
long way all right - wants to continue

618
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:29,809
with that exact thing yeah so right now

619
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:32,029
the extracts are really liked from from

620
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:33,919
clinics this is what I can I can confirm

621
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:35,389
but it's only hours perspective so

622
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,180
clinics there are clinics in Germany

623
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:40,100
that only prescribe only prescribe the

624
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,029
extracts and the reason behind is

625
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:48,949
because the dosage for the foreign

626
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:53,180
doctors is very simpler to follow up on

627
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:56,680
so if you provide the strange also if it

628
00:30:53,180 --> 00:31:00,710
comes on to the compounds you know this

629
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:04,298
the extract is very more efficient than

630
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:10,239
just vaporizing or smoking the buds

631
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:14,558
I think to answer the question short yes

632
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:18,459
it has a great future also in most part

633
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:22,618
in Germany the greatest since the

634
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:27,669
doctors and the physicians are the

635
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:31,718
people that allow you to use this that

636
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:34,119
sort of medication so yes definitely

637
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:37,419
it's all right David your thoughts and

638
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:41,348
plans about extracts yeah thanks for for

639
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:42,909
asking we are technically it's the same

640
00:31:41,348 --> 00:31:46,450
answer I gave you last year we will have

641
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:48,249
excerpts from this market very very very

642
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,319
soon on one way or another there is

643
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:53,409
actually a very good opportunity that

644
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:55,749
you will be around by it by q4 we're

645
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:58,719
very interested in bringing extracts to

646
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:01,209
the market in accordance with an or F

647
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:04,179
regulations I'm just highlighting this

648
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:05,589
because I know that at least have the

649
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:08,259
products that are in the market today

650
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:11,828
today are not Anacortes we want to give

651
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:13,778
the the the prescriber the doctor the

652
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:16,509
full transparency on which strain is

653
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:20,319
used non-changing strains for this

654
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:22,179
extract to my very best knowledge there

655
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:25,558
is no extract today or the market that

656
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:28,298
is actually being that transparent to

657
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,808
make it actually possible that you can

658
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:33,969
follow up on therapy results by having

659
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:37,028
two or three different different strains

660
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:38,469
might be in indica and sativa in this

661
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:41,979
industry we're very very interested in

662
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:45,808
having imported speaking also in

663
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:50,558
research for for all the extracts and

664
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:52,418
developing a path to finished medicine

665
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,489
will be definitely the next step then

666
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:58,589
after that starts all right thank you

667
00:32:54,489 --> 00:33:04,058
and I think that's about on the second

668
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:09,249
well we have 10 minutes 57 seconds left

669
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:11,979

speaking I'm Jonathan

675
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:26,899
you have Jonathan Goldman from sunlight

676
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,840
green import to God my question is

677
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,929
regarding what's your opinion about all

678
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:36,529
the companies that we see starting to

679
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:38,360
grow in Columbia and in Africa and the

680
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:40,129
low production prices are gonna come

681
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,869
from there and what's your opinion

682
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,590
regarding that and regarding the

683
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:47,299
regulation the GMP and how they're gonna

684
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:50,750
regulate to that and what you're gonna

685
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:56,149
do about those companies that bringing

686
00:33:50,750 --> 00:34:03,079
cheaper products yeah

687
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:05,360
whom do you ask I can I can start yeah

688
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:08,469
thank you very much it's I totally

689
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:12,489
understand your question products

690
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:14,898
whatever whatever is produced wherever

691
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:18,199
if they have to come to Europe if there

692
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:20,329
is an export or import license for those

693
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,108
products and it day but that's a matter

694
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,759
of the regulator who will actually then

695
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:28,489
judge whether the product complies with

696
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,929
the regulations as we have them here or

697
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:36,378
in the country where these products

698
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:39,500
being imported so what is likely to

699
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:41,839
happen is that what you see more in in

700
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,030
agriculture if you have typical products

701
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,700
and and and they want to make a typical

702
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,169
extract from a product grown outdoor or

703
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,689
in a greenhouse or they want to purify

704
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,489
certain compounds from it I think that

705
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,230
will be relatively easy it needs to

706
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:57,649
happen under under the under the right

707
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:00,469
regulations obviously and I think that

708
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,389
in in a certain way there will be room

709
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:05,299
for those products to come to market but

710
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:06,980
again they will have to be compliant in

711
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,510
full with the regulations as we have

712
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:14,858
them here would like to add something to

713
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:17,330
this one I know that there is a lot of

714
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:19,340
competitive prices out on this industry

715
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:21,679
let's not forget about one thing

716
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,329
actually before I'm here is about

717
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,489
getting the cheapest market on prices on

718
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:28,519
supply I'd rather find a supplier that

719
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:29,089
can actually deliver an up-to-date in

720
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:31,039
Germany

721
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,610
telling is the biggest supplier on the

722
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,529
German market is constantly delivering

723
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,300
this industry is not about to me at

724
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,910
least not to care Americans values is

725
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,980
not about having the cheapest price on

726
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:44,839
our suppliers we like to treat everybody

727
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,480
fairly in the supply chain we would like

728
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,640
to have everybody a fair chain in this

729
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,980
industry and this is what makes us

730
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:58,099
probably so significant so interesting

731
00:35:51,980 --> 00:36:01,519
as a partner also to global suppliers to

732
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:04,159
the next I'm Atmos fight I am a

733
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,519
pharmaceutical expert and consultant and

734
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,170
I have a question to toot a bit from my

735
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,429
perspectives there are increasing

736
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:15,800
numbers of local authorities in Germany

737
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:18,289
refusing import licenses because they

738
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,380
consider cannabis flower as a approvable

739
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:23,360
medicine because no compounding is done

740
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,400
in the pharmacies what is your

741
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,250
perspective about that there's a lot of

742
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,550
things ongoing in the moment and we also

743
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:35,150
have the possibility in Germany to ask

744
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,610
be firm to have a categorization of that

745
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,010
and my expectation will be that they

746
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:43,280
will ask them and what will happen if

747
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:46,850
they categorize cannabis flower as a

748
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,940
medicine which needs approval this can

749
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:51,920
happen yes we hear this question quite

750
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,590
often and I don't think it will happen

751
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,559
for one simple reason

752
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:59,570
cannabis flowers today are still an API

753
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:03,230
you don't have clinical studies we know

754
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:06,880
that it works you know that it works we

755
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:10,610
have we have achieved great results from

756
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,700
patients therapies however I have never

757
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:16,280
heard that German local authorities

758
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:18,439
potato Jeon are stopping to give out

759
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,330
licenses the proof that we have 21

760
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,200
importers in this industry today they're

761
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:25,670
trying themselves out in supplying

762
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:29,179
betokens material to the to the German

763
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,430
market is underlying my argument here on

764
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:33,529
top of it import licenses themselves

765
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,699
there might be a bit of confusion so

766
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,890
there is not this one

767
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:39,619
import license there's several different

768
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:42,379
licenses that you have to hold an order

769
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,119
to distribute into some

770
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,369
so medical cannabis is German market

771
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:51,109
this is a wholesale licensed cawt a

772
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:52,699
clearing clearing from restriction you

773
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,140
need to have an import license you need

774
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:56,029
to have release license you need to have

775
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:58,609
a license for a'ready material and so on

776
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:01,190
and so on so it's not this one singer

777
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,930
license I can tell you for sure that at

778
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:06,110
least kind of medical up-to-date never

779
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:08,750
had an issue for obtaining an import

780
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:11,150
permit we were the third company that

781
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,280
ever received the receipt a license to

782
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:16,760
import to try to distribute medical

783
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,160
cannabis but again I think the number of

784
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,510
increase in wholesalers that try

785
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,750
themselves out in this industry is

786
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,880
underlying an underlining that we don't

787
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:31,429
have an issue on the revelatory side we

788
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:34,030
have an issue on the supply side yeah I

789
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:38,179
have a question for Adam and and David

790
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:40,700
so we're we're API producer and we

791
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:43,730
currently we expect at the end of this

792
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:46,879
year to have a plant kind of medical

793
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:49,519
marijuana extracts under GMP with the

794
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,140
drug master file available and I was

795
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,210
wondering if you can buy a plant as an

796
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:56,629
API would you be able to buy the extract

797
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:59,079
as an API and then in the pharmacy by

798
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,930
compounding produce and oil out of it

799
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,969
before I answer your question let me ask

800
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:07,129
you a question who's given you the u GMP

801
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:09,079
is that a governmental GP or is a

802
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,410
private or dirt G or the governmental

803
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,889
GMP quit this actually makes it makes it

804
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:17,359
by far easier because the private origin

805
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:18,859
psi knows that there are a lot of

806
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,410
consultants that are that are offering

807
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,670
services are definitely good to have to

808
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:27,769
prepare themselves but are worthless

809
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:33,559
when it comes to import regulatory we

810
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:36,199
are able to import raw extract if you do

811
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,940
have an import if you do have a huge

812
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,869
impe certification date scheduled I

813
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:44,659
definitely would like to talk to you

814
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:46,009
after this panel - my opinion or - my

815
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:50,420
very best knowledge the only way to

816
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:52,990
bring product in from from any country

817
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,389
is in a way that you have raw extract

818
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:58,459
today so what would be the procedure

819
00:39:56,389 --> 00:40:02,659
sorry what would be the procedure then

820
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:04,190
we just ask our governments yeah well we

821
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:06,649
should have this discussion a bit more

822
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,450
in deep after this panel and I'm very

823
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,780
very sure that my Qi team can actually

824
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:12,609
help you in preparing yourself if we get

825

830
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:24,709
the pharmacy since I'm not a pharmacist

831
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:28,339
I can just give you a short answer is

832
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:34,309

833
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:36,050
extract for you hello this is alfredo

834
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:38,259
from marijuana business daily I have a

835
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,130
question for David and one for Yelling's

836
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,800
David you say you're the largest

837
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,450
independent importer and if I understood

838
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,039
correctly you're waiting for your first

839
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:48,889
shipment from Canada in a couple of

840
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:50,239
weeks and you've also said that cannabis

841
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:51,949
coming from the Netherlands is being

842
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,619
distributed equally or more or less

843
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:56,359
equally and among all the importers so

844
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,589
can you explain how you are the leader

845
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,349
then yeah sure

846
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,120
and wait a second and yelling you are

847
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:04,369
the sole producer in the Netherlands as

848
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,349
of now there was a tender last year that

849
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:08,089
was cancelled I think it will restart

850
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,279
again this year that's what's being said

851
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,440
can you give us more clarity regarding

852
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,330
if you expect to continue being the sole

853
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:19,159
producer in the Netherlands or you await

854
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:20,779
more competition let me just hold on

855
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,809
this question why we are the biggest

856
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,540
independent in water in this industry we

857
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:29,929
have been in this industry in supplying

858
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:32,000
2,400 pharmacies up to date in the past

859
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:33,319
eighteen eighty two twenty month that

860
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,420
definitely gives us a competitive

861
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,430
advantage over all the new startups that

862
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,079
are coming in this industry the chance

863
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:42,349
that you are walking into a pharmacy and

864
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,239
you would like them to order medical

865
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:47,150
cannabis and ask them if they know Kara

866
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,069
medical is very very significant we are

867
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,660
providing the best service to pharmacist

868
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:54,410
we're the most transparent player in

869
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:57,710
this industry we are currently having

870
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:59,869
the biggest customer service team that

871
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,909
is providing excellent service to these

872
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:05,650
pharmacies every single day and we have

873
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:09,670
just been thank you

874
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:14,048
so and we have been just voted by

875
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:16,480
internal requests from consultants

876
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:18,548
agency that I've seen we have been voted

877
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,559
as the best and most reliable supplier

878
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:27,998
and they say independent supply in this

879
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:31,359
industry that tender again but it was it

880
00:42:27,998 --> 00:42:35,639
was it was canceled last year its will

881
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:39,670
probably come up very soon now this year

882
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:42,248
as far as we know it will allow for

883
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:44,380
multiple producers in analysis as it did

884
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:46,209
from the beginning actually the fun

885
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,838
thing is that the standard process in

886
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:53,079
Holland is already relatively old but in

887
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:55,480
in the past 15 years nobody actually has

888
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,528
seen this whole tenor passing by and now

889
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,748
we see a bunch of interested

890
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:03,670
entrepreneurs who want to get into it

891
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:09,788
welcome of course I I do like

892
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:12,400
competition and we expect that the the

893
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:15,789
outcome of the tender will get into

894
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,769
resolved by January 1st 2021

895
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:22,410
so we will be in the market for a while

896
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:24,758
on our own still in the Netherlands and

897
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:27,969
yeah that's that's as far as it goes for

898
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:30,068
now I we are all basically waiting for

899
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:32,230
this tender to come out and actually

900
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:33,788
show what what the Dutch government the

901
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:40,329
direction is that government will take

902
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:43,900
on this one all right I think it's not

903
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:53,259
enough time for another question on my

904
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:54,970
watch it's 13 seconds left so thank you

905
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:57,809
all let's hear it again for your award

906
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:57,808

907
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:04,299
