fabulous panelists this is David

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,138
very important thing to know about him

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,760
is that he used to be a professional

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,919

and in his spare time he spends his time

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,379
in his home gym teaching his

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,060
nine-year-old son how to also be a buff

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,039
a little bit about your company

17
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,259
you know thank you very much Hillary and

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,299
uh hi everyone great to be here again I

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,979
was here last year and wonderful to be

20
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,659
here again seeing the seeing the crowds

21
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,819
and the interest around this industry

22
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,099
that's forming in one way or other

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,320
there's there's The Good the Bad and

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,300
occasionally the ugly that we're seeing

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,159
around the industry right so um I've

26
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,799
been about 11 years now working in this

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,619
space originally in Canada working on on

28
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,899
licensing compliance security areas and

29
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,640
over the years just kind of saw that

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,799
there was a global market forming so I

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,900
worked on quite a few projects

32
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,340
um as the markets rolled out Germany

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,760
some of the Consulting for the early

34
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,500
producers here ultimately I was about to

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,500
really launch into the global side when

36
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,180
covert came so after covid now I've been

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,900
getting back into the global side we do

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,000
m a uh um across the global cannabis

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,380
industry so working on Acquisitions

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,900
mergers

41
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,478
um some smart investment work as well as

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,079
the capital markets have have um have

43
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,158
have tightened up and yeah again excited

44
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,339
to be here

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,299
so Carmen is a bit of a speed demon she

46
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,219
used to drive race cars uh and in her

47
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,860
spare time she likes to hurt her hurdle

48
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,019
herself down mountains either on skis or

49
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,859
bicycles going as fast as she possibly

50
00:01:52,019 --> 00:02:01,319
can and now in her spare time what there

51
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:03,000
is of it she manages a race car team so

52
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,679
we'll be sure to have to learn more

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,299
about that but tell us a little bit more

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,300
about your company

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,760
yeah Marina everyone my name is Carmen

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,280
Darren I'm the CEO of Helios

57
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,500
Therapeutics we are New Zealand's

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,640
largest licensed producer of medicinal

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,878
cannabis

60
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,699
Helios is a medicines company we are

61
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,060
very much focused on delivering outcomes

62
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,359
for patients and have moved its speed

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,979
um to be able to do that in New Zealand

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
uh one of the things probably is a

65
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,299
little bit of background around the New

66
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,759
Zealand industry is just to understand

67
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,340
the environment in which we work so we

68
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,019
are a full Medical Market in New Zealand

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,200
any doctor can prescribe for any

70
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,539
condition and that came in on the 1st of

71
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:52,199
October in 2021

72
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:54,299
the 4th of October 2021 just four days

73
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,579
later Helios launched our first products

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,680
into market so we're coming up on two

75
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,840
years of products into Market

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,819
last year we launched new zealand-grown

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,439
New Zealand made medicines and we're

78
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,018
really able to drive access and

79
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,459
affordability for our patients in New

80
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,739
Zealand and it's great to be able to

81
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,140

98
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,640
of cannabis in Australia seven years ago

99
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,958
um I joined canned group so I was CEO at

100

licensed in Australia and I'm also the

00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,199
delegation here from Australia and and

106
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,719
sitting right next to a New Zealand

107
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,959
funnily enough across the ditch in room

108
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,418
two but um yeah here to to see what's

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,100
happening on the global scale and and

110
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,258
Australia's role to play in that

111
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,900
fabulous thank you and I'll just

112
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,520
introduce myself very quickly I started

113
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,279
Distributing medical cannabis in the mid

114
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,560
90s in Canada so I started a movement

115
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,019
that turned into an industry in Canada

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,300
and then spent the past few years in the

117
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:42,000
c-suite of canopy growth and now I'm

118
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,740
doing independent Consulting work

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,500
um so the first thing that I want to ask

120
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,478
you when any one of you can chime in do

121
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,879
you think that in Australia or New

122
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,459
Zealand or other Emerging Markets are we

123
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,259
going to be able to avoid the same boom

124
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,039
and bust that we experienced in Canada

125
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:01,439
from hyped up valuations and inflated

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,600
Market predictions

127
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,399
now I might start with that one because

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,960
in fact we've already been there done

129
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,418
that in Australia

130
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,478
um we definitely got caught up in the

131
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:14,819
Canadian bubble as it was inflating with

132
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,339
the whole wreck Market coming on and the

133
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,599
excitement that happened back in 2017

134
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:20,638
and 18

135
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,479
um the Australian system only came into

136
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,079
effect in 2016 uh it was announced 2017

137
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:31,439
we got the first license in in March of

138
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,240
that year was right when Canada was in

139
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,399
full inflation mode and and we had

140
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,180
Canadian activity in in our part of the

141
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:41,819
world as well so uh when the Canadian

142
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,759
Bubble Burst that definitely had effect

143
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,918
right around the world and it has meant

144
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,379
that we've had to pull pull our horns in

145
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,120
in Australia and New Zealand we've done

146
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,159
that and it's

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,139
because we've got such a good regulatory

148
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,880
structure underlying it though we've

149
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,918
we've gone through that rough patch and

150
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,019
we're now in a really strong position to

151
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:04,079
to move forward without it just being

152
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,478
seen as another uh bubble coming up so

153
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,038
it's it's inflating carefully since I've

154
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,439
been here this week I've heard some

155
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,899
pretty dramatic and optimistic

156
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,939
predictions for the rapid exponential

157
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,560
growth of the German market and it

158
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,180
really does make me worry that we're not

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,280
learning from the lessons of what we've

160
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,079
experienced in Canada what are you

161
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,399
seeing in other countries around the

162
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,560
world that you're working in in terms of

163
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,239
this issue yeah I mean you know

164
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,819
definitely

165
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,400
um when you when you look at this the

166
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,539
Canadian situation what happened

167
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,339
definitely a learning curve I think for

168
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:37,860
the world and I lived it close by I was

169
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,799
actually involved in very close to it I

170
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,538
think really When I Was Here a year ago

171
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,939
I look at valuations I look at company

172
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:46,860
performers I look at performance metrics

173
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,079
forecasting and look at you know what

174
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,100
this company is saying might they be

175
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,599
successful because you've got to pick

176
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,740
winners and losers sometimes in this

177
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,479
industry if you're an investor

178
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,740
especially

179
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,538
um and I think it's been a big

180
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,400
difference from last year to this year a

181
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,199
year ago we were still seeing the really

182
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,459
hype valuations particularly in the

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,500
European market

184
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,079
some companies that had were really

185
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,120
basing their valuations on on

186
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,038
projections and forecasts that frankly

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,379
weren't really defensible

188
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,759
um I think now even to now to this year

189
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,699
there's a big difference you know I'm

190
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,139
seeing now we see a bit more realism in

191
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,598
terms of the evaluations that we're

192
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,939
seeing on the private side definitely

193
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,560
the public side to a degree as well but

194
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,418
there's maybe not quite caught up yet

195
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,740
but definitely seeing some Evolution and

196
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,639
I think that the

197
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,139
the the investor class are learning from

198
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,639
what's happened around the world

199
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,199
particularly in Canada

200
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,220
I think they're adjusting themselves and

201
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,560
they expect to see more veracity to the

202
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,300
the these pitch decks

203
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,918
um assumptions it's not going to be ten

204
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,139
dollars a gram or 15 a gram or whatever

205
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,698
it is in this market or that it's

206
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,199
actually going to be more like this and

207
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,879
the market size is not going to be this

208
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,259
it's going to be more like this this is

209
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,579
what I think we're seeing a bit of now

210
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,860
although there's still quite a long way

211
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:04,098
to go do you want to add anything yeah

212
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,098
absolutely so my nana always used to

213
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,918
I think that New Zealand for us our

214
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,740
cannabis industry started coming online

215
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:18,719
just as covert hit and then the whole

216
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,060
country went into lockdown

217
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,879
and then we went into a global financial

218
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,360
crisis and depression so

219
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,819
um we probably haven't seen the crash in

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,038
valuations just because of the timing of

221
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,599
when our industry came on and we

222
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:34,979
absolutely had some companies that were

223
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,560
at higher valuations in the beginning

224
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,139
including Helios that have now come down

225
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,059
to more realistic valuations but there

226
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,399
hasn't been the multiples crash that

227
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,759
we've seen in other places and I think

228
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,320
that actually quietly delivering down in

229
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,240
New Zealand a lot of the New Zealand

230
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,519
cannabis companies for what they have

231
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,639
delivered already and the potential they

232
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,500
have to go into the global markets are

233
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,778
undervalued we have a couple of publicly

234
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,419
listed companies in New Zealand heliers

235
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:05,179
is a private company we have been able

236
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:08,819
to do that all through individual

237
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:10,979
investors and I think that it's really

238
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,980
it'll be interesting to see how things

239
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,920
settle and how the valuations play out

240
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,720
as now the New Zealand companies start

241
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,179
exporting into markets around the world

242
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,519
world thank you

243
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,439
um David another one for you so you

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,419
really have your finger on the pulse of

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,920
the global supply chain and I'm

246
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:30,419
wondering if you can tell us a little

247
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,360
bit about the countries that you work in

248
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,278
how you characterize them and then let's

249
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,759
just get right down to it and tell us

250
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,200
about the range of the price point for

251
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,338
companies that are selling into those

252
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,339
countries

253
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,300
yeah sure I mean I I think again we're

254
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,940
seeing

255
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,620
um a very very variable

256
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,540
um Global Market I think there's an

257
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,220
assumption sometimes that the EU is a

258
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,599
monolith and all those countries are

259
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,639
somewhat similar or something of course

260
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,320
they're all very very different

261
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,019
um even even in Germany all the states

262
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,560
have slightly different takes on

263
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:06,299
elements of import export Etc so there's

264
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,099
a lot to learn out there I think one of

265
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:11,458
the first things I'll probably repeat a

266
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,839
few times there's a lot of sources that

267
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,159
folks get information from this

268
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,800
conference is called of course one of

269
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,278
them and I encourage you to do that and

270
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,439
to and to be insatiable in terms of your

271
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,720
take-up of information

272
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,940
but all sources aren't the same and so

273
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,700
you know you need to be cautious about

274
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,920
what you assume or what you know what

275
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,259
you learn about the global markets

276
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,699
and the sources of data are quite narrow

277
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,379
really there's not a lot of really

278
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,600
reliable data out there that's up to

279
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,039
speed in terms of how I kind of

280
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,080
characterize the different market

281
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:46,379
segments I think there are some

282
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,959
countries that I would call pre-ranked

283
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,120
markets right their medical of course

284
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,159
but they're a prereq where the whether

285
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,620
it's a self-payers as in Germany or

286
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,740
whether there's other reasons why the

287
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,778
medical Market is is partly medical

288
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,360
patients that have sometimes serious

289
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,799
needs other times of Wellness related

290
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,019
but there's still a medicinal patient

291
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,479
but then we have you know the prereq

292
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,100
idea where really you you see a

293
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,120
microcosm of Canada one of the things

294
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,860
that we've heard a lot at this

295
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,480
conference already in talking especially

296
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,919
in the evening you know what's new in

297
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,360
Canada what streams are coming out you

298
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,879
know where's the crack where's the craft

299
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,339
uh um next drop coming you know because

300
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,078
I think some of the companies in

301
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,240
countries like Germany and I think would

302
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,919
be Australia too actually are looking at

303
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,500
what's happening with kind of on The

304
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,419
Cutting Edge of in California too and

305
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,980
what can we grasp on to and kind of

306
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,620
bring into our Market

307
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,399
the German Market is getting a little

308
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,560
busier I think there are about a maybe

309
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,940
150 odd different products I think 600

310
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,518
listings so some companies are

311
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,140
multiplying the products uh but the

312
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,778
interesting thing is a lot of those

313
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,879
products are running out you know and to

314
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,100
me you know that kind of again

315
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,740
underlines one of the key things I think

316
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,379
in these different market segments is as

317
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,139
a as a supplier into those markets and

318
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:07,439
the distributor if you can't latch on to

319
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,059
Reliable Supply that is consistent that

320
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,700
hits a similar Mark and you can

321
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,199
replenish those orders on and on we've

322
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,300
seen the harm that does certainly in

323
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,879
Canada other countries where once you

324
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,620
lose the confidence of the patient you

325
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,439
know you're really in a in a sticky spot

326
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,000
so just to roll up um prereq Market

327
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,279
countries Australia would be in there

328
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,278
Germany would be in there we are Pure

329
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,600
medical uh UK I think is Pure medical I

330
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,338
think New Zealand probably is more Pure

331
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,339
medical where we have it's a much more

332
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,980
of a very focused medical Paradigm

333
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,899
um and and the idea of a prereq kind of

334
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,000
thing really or Iraq is is in the in

335
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,200
Legacy Market or the black market for

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,339
the most part

337
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,959
um and then there are some Emerging

338
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,180
Markets too that are fairly interesting

339
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,059
around the world obviously we're looking

340
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:54,479
at some of the European countries Poland

341
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,879
is uh is coming on Brazil is a country

342
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,920
that's that's got things happening

343
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,458
um so you know really you know I I think

344
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:05,219
the the key to this is to really educate

345
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,299
yourself as if you're cultivating and

346
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,920
producing into the market if you're

347
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:09,599
Distributing whatever you're on the

348
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,819
value chain if you're looking at the

349
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,399
global market as a as a playground for

350
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,560
business you need to know where to play

351
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,379
and how to win that's really to me the

352
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,599
critical thing and we always be crass

353
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,939
about it your success relies on your

354
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,100
knowledge understanding of where to

355
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,980
choose to channel your products or your

356
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,019
interest and how to negotiate and

357
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,300
navigate that with respect to getting

358
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,940
those products into Market in a reliable

359
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,159
way and David I was just going to say in

360
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,480
terms of

361
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,639
characterizing Australia as a prereq

362
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,259
market and you're pointing there at the

363
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:47,220
volume of flower that's being sold into

364
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,500
Australia but uh I'd push hard on the

365
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,000
fact that from a medical focus and

366
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,860
perspective Australia's in a really

367
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,379
strong position and it is absolutely

368
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,959
where we're focused around bringing the

369
00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:00,838
science into cannabinoids and medicine

370
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,338
and the regulatory environment we have

371
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,380
there and that's why it's important

372
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,120
people understand if they're going to be

373
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,578
bringing product into Australia and how

374
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,919
it'll play in that space the GMP

375
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:14,578
requirement and the Law changes as of

376
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:16,740
tomorrow so first of July TGO 93 has a

377
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,739
requirement that Imports our equivalent

378
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,259
quality to GMP so that needs to be

379
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,120
understood but having that framework in

380
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,100
place the real opportunity we see is

381
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,139
that being the basis for bringing

382
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,839
clinical trial work to Australia and

383
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,459
that capability is going to from a

384
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,700
medical perspective really been

385
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,979
important Avenue forward for the global

386
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,100
industry I think so I want to come back

387
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,800
to talking about a price per gram in

388
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,720
terms of the the price that cannabis is

389
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,299
selling into these markets and then how

390
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,620
that corresponds to what the patients

391
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,419
are paying

392
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,560
so perhaps you can talk a little bit

393
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:54,599
about the range of what you're seeing

394
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,338
sure yeah and then I'd love to hear

395
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,278
about what patients are paying program

396
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:02,760
in both New Zealand and Australia yeah I

397
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,519
mean pricing is is very um elastic and

398
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,679
pricing is is not a stable thing of

399
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,240
course it changes over time certainly in

400
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,939
the Canadian market we've seen a

401
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,860
decimation of the B2B Market where you

402
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,680
know high quality craft Canadian

403
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,120
cannabis you know can be selling for a

404
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,799
dollar fifty two dollars a gram in

405
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,720
Canadian which is which is sad to say

406
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,299
considering it costs that much almost to

407
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,920
grow it so it's been very challenging

408
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,479
and there's lots of reasons for that

409
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,698
it's not I'm going to be Focus for

410
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,560
today's panel but the Canadian Market is

411
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:33,479
is difficult and so there's lots of

412
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,099
exporters from Canada that are looking

413
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,839
for the higher price point in the global

414
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,159
markets that's that's a one of the

415
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,260
biggest thing to know about how the

416
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,879
global industry is moving around because

417
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,319
there's lots of pressure from Canada and

418
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,759
lots of flower from Canada that wants to

419
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,160
go into the market

420
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,958
um when you look at the pricing into you

421
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,419
know Israel is obviously a large Market

422
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,159
that pricing is moved around you know I

423
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,198
think what we're seeing right now is

424
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,240
anywhere from a I'm going to talk

425
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:01,979
Canadian dollars um

426
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:04,500
probably from like a 275 to 375 four

427
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,600
dollar type pricing into Israel for for

428
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,919
decent Quality Craft

429
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,680
um when we get into a market like

430
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,719
Australia again this is

431
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,278
categories I think of product and and

432
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,019
all the different distributors pay

433
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,120
different prices there's no sort of set

434
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,620
limit but I think Australia I've seen

435
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,360
pricing actually get fairly low but I've

436
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,639
also seen pricing up at five dollars six

437
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,820
dollars Canadian a gram 5.5 is probably

438
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,620
a good number to say is uh was a Target

439
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,560
if you're if you're if you're selling

440
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,639
into that market uh Germany

441
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,879
um I think there's a little bit more

442
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,639
opportunity if you are really doing

443
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,320
quite craft cannabis that really ticks

444
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,539
all the boxes

445
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,278
um for what for better or worse high THC

446
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,198
which is an issue that that you know I

447
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,299
think is a is a quite a debatable point

448
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,219
what we should be doing there

449
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,319
um high terpene profile bag appeal all

450
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,480
those boxes I think you know we can see

451
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,500
up to uh price of

452
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,060
or 50 euros a gram 4 450 around that

453
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,799
range and we're seeing roughly maybe

454
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,139
double that for sales into the into the

455
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,759
into the um pharmacies roughly it's kind

456
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,860
of a bit of a guide again it very much

457
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,379
depends on the quality of the product

458
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,119
and and the players involved so now

459
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,100
we're talking in euros and now I want to

460
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,678
talk about the price per gram to

461
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:19,619
patients in your countries but I'm not

462
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,419
doing the math on the Fly

463
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,818
I'd love to hear about what patients are

464
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,259
paying per gram and also Insurance

465
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,759
structures in terms of if there's

466
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,859
coverage for patients talk a little bit

467
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,720
about which patients are eligible for

468
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,579
what kind of insurance coverage

469
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,200
yeah sure so from an Australian

470
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:37,019
perspective

471
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,779
pretty simple math the flower around ten

472
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:41,759
dollars a gram so that's about six Euro

473
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,038
I think isn't it something like that but

474
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:47,879
um so that's the patient level there

475
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:49,558
there is some health cover but it's not

476
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,179
um under the PBS though the

477
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,678
pharmaceutical benefits scheme in

478
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,080
Australia you have to have a registered

479
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,700
medicine go through that process and all

480
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,619
of the product in Australia is being

481
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,440
sold as a under the special access

482
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,058
scheme as an unregistered medicine so

483
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,460
it's um

484
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:08,759
yeah and there's a range that's been

485
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,919
happening and and with the Imports uh

486
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,500
previously where they've been um

487
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,980
importing under TGO 93 the Therapeutics

488
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,720
Goods order that remain silent on on the

489
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,880
GMP requirement meant that we haven't

490
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,339
seen a whole lot of flower coming from

491
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
Canada and elsewhere that uh so there's

492
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:29,038
quite a range of quality product that's

493
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,279
around and um patients in that space are

494
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,500
quite Discerning and it's been an

495
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,779
interesting space so I think as as that

496
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,419
washes through now and and there there

497
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,519
has been a pile of material pushed into

498
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,020
Australia ahead of the the change in the

499
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,639
legislation

500
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:45,480
um but I think we'll see that settle

501
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,280
down

502
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,860
yeah I was going to ask you what the

503
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,259
rules changing literally tomorrow how

504
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:54,479
long do you think it will be before the

505
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,859
pricing in Australia settles down and if

506
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,660
you've got a prediction on where maybe

507
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,099
explain about the rules that are

508
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,240
changing tomorrow in case everybody in

509
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,298
the audience isn't quite up to speed

510
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,480
with that yeah so TGO 93 is the

511
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:08,579
technical term therapeutic Goods order

512
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,279
and when they introduced cannabis and

513
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:14,519
opened up the special access pathway

514
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,859
schemas unregistered medicines they had

515
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,960
a requirement that anything came in had

516
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:22,319
to be free of contaminants heavy metals

517
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,940
aflatoxin okra toxin and and but someone

518
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,798
worked out pretty early on or hang on

519
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,259
they didn't say anything about GMP

520
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,359
whereas Australian manufactured material

521
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:32,759
all has to any licensed operator in

522
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,918
Australia has to produce to GMP we're

523
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,759
only allowed export GMP quality product

524
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:41,160
so it was a not altogether helpful uh

525
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,558
oversight in how the legislation was put

526
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,298
into play to start with yes it helped

527
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,279
get the ball rolling and because we

528
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:49,259
didn't yet have an industry producing

529
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,418
any material it meant that we could

530
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:54,419
bring material in and and that worked

531
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,059
but then some entrepreneurial people

532
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:59,580
worked out hang on we can actually get a

533
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:01,980
technical term shitload of material in

534
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:04,199
that doesn't come in with that GMP

535
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,940
overhead on it yeah well there's a lot

536
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,120
of talk right now about what I'm hearing

537
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,558
is GMP washing in terms of being able to

538
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,839
really steal people trying to figure out

539
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,220
how they can still check the boxes on

540
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,959
being able to get their product into

541
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Australia you know I think it's also an

542
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,038
interesting conversation the difference

543
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,440
between GMP and quality cannabis you

544
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:23,879
know you talk about bag appeal and how

545
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,740
well it's cured and how well it's

546
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,600
trimmed and a lot of the conversation

547
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,419
that I'm hearing really is I think is

548
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,918
assuming that a GMP product is going to

549
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,240
be the highest quality product and in

550
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,220
fact I think we know from a consumer

551
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,599
perspective that that's not true yeah

552
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,400
and and look I think the really

553
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,558
important thing is that underlying all

554
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,500
of this is the fact that what we don't

555
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,119
want to have is confidence undermined at

556
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,880
the patient level at the prescriber

557
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,678
level and probably the the kicker in all

558
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,900
of this which comes back to you really

559
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,759
do need to understand the technicality

560
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,038
of what's required to have product in

561
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,200
there is that and the TGA made it really

562
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,140
clear at our conferences here at a

563
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,600
cannabis that if they find product

564
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,400
that's not fit for purpose it's being

565
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,740
transacted in the market it's actually

566
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,000
not just the product sponsor that

567
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,460
brought the product in but the

568
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,200
prescribing doctor the pharmacist who

569
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,720
issued the product they're all liable to

570
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,819
be prosecuted by the TGA and they made

571
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,980
that pretty clear so

572
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,839
back to what we're trying to do here is

573
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,339
establish an industry we know it's not

574
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,899
all going to be based on Australian

575
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:26,759
grown and produced material there's

576
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,860
absolutely scope for

577
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,900
cannabis to move around the world in all

578
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,939
directions what we don't want to see

579
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,340
happen is confidence undermined and

580
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,259
doctors being put in a in a position

581
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:39,298
where they say hang on this doesn't look

582
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,658
anything like a medicine you know I told

583
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:44,720
you it wasn't real and they pushed back

584
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,720
um

585
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,658
your regulatory framework has some teeth

586
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,879
that's a little bit different than other

587
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,340
countries maybe you can share with us

588
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,840
about your driving legislation and how

589
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:57,058
you feel like that's impacting the

590
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,678
growth of the Australian Market yeah

591
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:00,500
that's that's a really good question and

592
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,280
it's it's a

593
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,798
discrimination that's happening with

594
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,099
cannabis in in Australia is it's been

595
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,200
caught under this legislation where uh

596
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,658
if you're a driver and you're found to

597
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,480
have cannabinoids in your system the

598
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:17,159
police are obliged to prosecute you

599
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,519
doesn't matter if you're impaired or not

600
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,679
and as an industry obliged to prosecure

601
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,019
they have no discretion they have no

602
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,120
discretion so other than in Tasmania

603
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,700
we've got a small island to the South

604
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,979
that someone made a legislative mistake

605
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,319
and it's an oversight that actually

606
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,779
allows people in Tasmania who are using

607
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,119
medicine to treat a condition to to

608
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,918
still drive which is exactly what should

609
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,899
happen we're not saying anyone should be

610
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,520
driving while they're impaired but

611
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,320
there's no way they should be prosecuted

612
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,079
by having cannabinoids in their system

613
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,538
and it's having a huge impact at patient

614
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:54,000
level where even in my own family I've

615
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:56,819
got people who know it would be useful

616
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,798
to help with sleep or with pain but are

617
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,918
not prepared to take cannabis because

618
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,599
they can't afford to not drive and

619
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,780
they're they're worried that they'll be

620
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:09,418
picked up so that's that is a key Focus

621
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:12,779
for us is to get that drive change

622
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,440
there's a whole push along that line

623
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,720
um

624
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,240
that we're saying treat it like any

625
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,919
other medicine if they are talking to

626
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,359
their prescribing doctor and managing it

627
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,980
they should be able to manage and

628
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,579
understand how and when they can use

629
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,860
medicine for their quality of life and

630
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,839
not impact on on driving and I would

631
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,658
comment that that kind of stigma that

632
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:35,699
permeates regulatory Frameworks is a

633
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,919
hangover from prohibition and it's

634
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,900
really important I think to continue to

635
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,179
unpack the history of Prohibition in

636
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,659
North America and for us all to really

637
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:48,120
understand how racist that legislation

638
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,919
was and what the intention of it was and

639
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,599
for us to realize it as we're regulating

640
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,000
cannabis around the world if we don't

641
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,980
address that part of the history of

642
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,900
prohibition if we don't address it with

643
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,460
our Regulators if we aren't informing

644
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,759
and educating people about the history

645
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,038
of prohibition we actually will see that

646
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,200
kind of stigma permeate the regulatory

647
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,819
framework and cause those kinds of

648
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,919
really serious discriminations for

649
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:13,379
patients in Canada our regulatory

650
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,538
framework we legalized cannabis Within

651
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,820
intention to minimize the harms of it

652
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,319
not because my government said hey I'm

653
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,379
really sorry about the Hundred Years of

654
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,939
lies and all of the like lives that were

655
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,440
ruined and people that were jailed and

656
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,820
that all of the indigenous and brown and

657
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,860
black people were disproportionately

658
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:31,918
punished why don't we figure out a way

659
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,899
to correct that we didn't do that and so

660
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,280
even though we have legalized cannabis

661
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,740
in Canada both for medical and

662
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,658
recreational purposes the stigma that

663
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,720
permeates the regulatory framework is

664
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:45,000
actually strangling our industry so high

665
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,220
taxation over regulation we're not

666
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,859
allowed to talk to Consumers so actually

667
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,440
doing the ethical and purpose-filled and

668
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,479
values-based work around addressing the

669
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,700
history of prohibition we don't just do

670
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,798
it because it's the right thing to do it

671
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,319
actually needs to happen in order to be

672
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:04,079
able to build healthy functional

673
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,538
Industries around the world brief rant

674
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,220
from your moderator

675
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,619
um

676
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,159
let's and also

677
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:13,158
thank you

678
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,579
let's talk about uh New Zealand as

679
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,379
Carmen as I've had the opportunity to

680
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:24,298
get to know you one of the things that I

681
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,299
really appreciate about your narrative

682
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:29,220
is you are really patient focused I

683
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:31,918
don't hear you talking about Market size

684
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,380
and margins I really hear you talking

685
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,840
about patient outcomes and you have a

686
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,240
beautiful patient-centric approach and I

687
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,939
think that that is

688
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,140
um it that approach is growing your

689
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:49,558
market and tell us about how you see the

690
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,720
stigma dissolving in New Zealand and how

691
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:53,460
and why that's happening and what you

692
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,759
and the other companies are doing to

693
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:59,700
address those issues yeah absolutely so

694
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,019
maybe to help put into context let me

695
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,940
start with the numbers that I haven't

696
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,500
spoken about already and that'll give

697
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,120
you some insight as to how we've been

698
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,500
able to move the dial on those numbers

699
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:13,859
so when I was here last year at ICBC we

700
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,599
were talking about 30 000 patients in

701
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:18,119
New Zealand accessing medicinal cannabis

702
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:21,778
in 2021 we're a small nation just five

703
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:23,639
million people in 2022 we had 60 000

704
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:25,259
prescriptions written for medicinal

705
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,900
cannabis so a double

706
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:31,319
we predicted that 2023 it was going to

707
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,419
double again to around 120

708
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,099
000 prescriptions but actually halfway

709
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,659
through the year we see that the market

710
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:38,038
is growing faster than what we thought

711
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,200
it was going to be and it will land

712
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,778
higher than that

713
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,460
um that is because people are talking to

714
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:46,798
each other the medicine is actually

715
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,558
really helping people a lot of it is

716
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,940
patient driven and patient-led so they

717
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,918
might be talking to their neighbor Over

718
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,259
The Back Fence and their neighbor is

719
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,480
complaining about not sleeping and they

720
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:00,839
say oh I'm trying cannabis how about you

721
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,380
tried that so where the Gap then Falls

722
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,418
is to the prescribers because a patient

723
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,419
goes to the prescriber and says I want

724
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:11,880
to try cannabis and the prescriber says

725
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:14,759
I don't know anything about it so one of

726
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,520
the key things that Helios but also all

727
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,900
of the other companies that are

728
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,179
providing medicinal cannabis in New

729
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,259
Zealand are doing is working with the

730
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,620
doctors

731
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:27,778
uh we were all at a GP conference just

732
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:31,319
two weeks ago before jumping on planes

733
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:34,079
and coming to Berlin and at that GP

734
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,339
conference in Rotorua there was a

735
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,960
two-hour plenary session around

736
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:39,899
medicinal cannabis that was really well

737
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,000
attended so there is also I guess a pull

738
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,580
from the doctors and we are trying to

739
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,679
fill that vacuum of information so that

740
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:50,038
we can then provide for more and more

741
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:52,200
patients awesome and Peter maybe you can

742
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:54,658
talk a little bit about the growth of

743
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,759
the patient access and the market also

744
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,778
in Australia because even though your

745
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,200
patients have to deal with these

746
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:02,940
Draconian driving laws your your your

747
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,500
Market is expanding and more and more

748
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,320
patients are getting access every day

749
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,839
yeah absolutely and and some of the data

750
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,939
that came out earlier this year there

751
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,558
have now been over a million approvals

752
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,480
through the special access scheme over

753
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,579
the journey so that's not a million

754
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,038
patients but it is a sign that it is

755
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:22,199
becoming mainstream we've got something

756
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,359
like 30 000 doctors in Australia

757
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,340
Australia is around four to five

758
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,379
thousand of them that are now actively

759
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,418
prescribing under

760
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,940
um special access scheme and the

761
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:34,500
authorized prescriber scheme the the

762
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,538
numbers and I was talking to our

763
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,640
government people here today about

764
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:40,919
getting some clarity and transparency

765
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,778
around what is happening with patient

766
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,278
access and products to patients is

767
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,220
something that we're working on because

768
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,839
at the moment it is difficult to pin

769
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,579
down exactly what's happening but

770
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:53,158
there's no doubt there's a push in a

771
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,960
growth which is really encouraging and

772
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,880
investing in physician education is

773
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,079
something that sometimes companies in

774
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,240
the early stages have a hard time

775
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,579
committing to because it's an investment

776
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,159
that Rises the Tide for All Ships right

777
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,439
but instead of companies really focusing

778
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,900
on the same group of prescribers and

779
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,058
trying to get their sort of loyalty the

780
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,980
work to convert new Physicians into the

781
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:16,619
space is actually what's going to touch

782
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,480
more patients in the end yeah and as an

783
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:20,778
industry Association that's a key role

784
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,058
we're playing to to do that because

785
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:26,339
as an registered medicine it's illegal

786
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:29,519
to do any sort of promotion or

787
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:31,918
advertising so and you can't do that at

788
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,599
a company or product specific level but

789
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,940
as an industry Association we can

790
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,879
absolutely bring a teacher positions

791
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,620
yeah so you two have trade

792
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,380
representatives from your government

793
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:45,298
here at this event and I was chatting

794
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,460
with them both yesterday and coming from

795
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:49,619
Canada where our government is not

796
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,140
interested in helping to grow our

797
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,058
industry they're not definitely not

798
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,880
interested in helping us be successful

799
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,918
in a global Marketplace how on Earth did

800
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,740
you navigate the relationships with your

801
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,960
governments where they are here at ICBC

802
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,700
and chatting about how much they love

803
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,278
this industry and support your companies

804
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,980
to me it's like a miracle

805
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,720
do you want to go first or well so uh

806
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,579
Global Victoria have got to stand here

807
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,259
that's the Victorian government and they

808
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,000
actually the Victorian government got

809
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,819
the ball rolling in Australia they were

810
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,919
the first to put legislation into play

811
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,839
um but then had to step back because as

812
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,059
signatory to the UN single convention

813
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:28,259
that had to be federally legislated and

814
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,819
that's when the federal federal

815
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,700
government came in over the top and

816
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:34,439
created the Office of drug control but

817
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,058
the Victorian government have been

818
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,759
strongly involved the whole way through

819
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:41,158
they saw the opportunity and there's no

820
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,720
doubt we punch above our weight in our

821
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,760
corner of the world I think Australia

822
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,500
and New Zealand but Melbourne and

823
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,419
Victoria in particular have a really

824
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,119
strong Medical Science Background as

825
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,860
well and the uh I think it came up the

826
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,859
other day in the global investment Forum

827
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:57,798
that someone made the point that if

828
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:00,178
you're looking to do clinical trial work

829
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:03,179
Australia and Israel are the two key

830
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,159
areas to focus on for that so there's no

831
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,559
doubt the next challenge for us is to

832
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,539
bring the science into the application

833
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,759
of cannabinoids in human health and

834
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:13,558
we're at the Forefront and with a really

835
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,859
strong regulatory environment to support

836
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,839
it and that covers both Australia and

837
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:20,759
New Zealand and I think we've seen

838
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:23,038
you know we're next to each other out in

839
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:25,140
the hall and uh it's it's a nice

840
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,058
juxtaposition to have in terms of how

841
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,919
we're working together as both

842
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:30,298
government bodies are talking to each

843
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,120
other it's really it's really wonderful

844
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:35,220
to see we are 10 minutes out so I'm

845
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,959
going to start hustling us through so I

846
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,120
have a big question for you but I want

847
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,058
you to try to give us a short answer to

848
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,979
a brief question so you have we're going

849
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:45,298
to kind of like go from talking for to

850
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,460
Australia and New Zealand and kind of

851
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:50,639
pull up and look at the globe again so

852
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,679
you have a very nuanced system for

853
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,600
assessing markets you do really deep

854
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,519
Dives when you're looking at new and

855
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,719
emerging markets and I know that this is

856
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,940
a big question because we talked about

857
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,558
it for about a half an hour but can you

858
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,659
take a couple of minutes and just talk

859
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:04,980
about all of the Nuance factors that you

860
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,840
look at when you're looking at new

861
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,519
markets

862
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,859
yeah sure and I think that what we've

863
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,139
been sharing here from our colleagues

864
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:15,000
Australia New Zealand is really

865
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,399
exemplifies the differences you know

866
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,200
some of the nuances so we're looking at

867
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:20,599
you know things when you walk right back

868
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,240
to the patient level

869
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:25,319
how can patients access the medicine in

870
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,079
that country

871
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,418
how many prescribers are there how are

872
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,178
the prescribers educated

873
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:35,600
um how is you know do you look then at

874
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,559
the the actual provision of the medicine

875
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,939
where are people

876
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,398
um going to buy this from how many

877
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,480
outlets what's the availability so we

878
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:44,519
start off with you know doctors

879
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,259
prescribing education we move through

880
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,639
then to you know actually how the

881
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:49,980
medicine is going to get transferred or

882
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,179
made available to the patients

883
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,620
um you know there's a lot of other

884
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,080
factors to look at the regulations

885
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:57,178
obviously are very very important the

886
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,379
regulations can be

887
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,940
um they're always going to be fairly

888
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,679
strict on the medical cannabis side

889
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,919
because that's the way that the system's

890
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,960
set up but there are some countries that

891
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,600
are more amenable or perhaps there's

892
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,640
ways to navigate their regulations a

893
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,500
little differently than other countries

894
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,320
so I think we said New Zealand earlier

895
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,880
it's very strict there's a Jewish GMP

896
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,579
requirements and there's not a lot of

897
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,799
wiggle room you look at other countries

898
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,000
and sometimes there are ways I mean even

899
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,240
in Germany if you look at the

900
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,798
variability in the states in Germany

901
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,538
people would prefer to import into

902
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,179
certain States than other states right

903
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:36,179
it's because there's an ability to have

904
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:39,000
a little bit more of a certainty around

905
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,440
um just how strictly applied the

906
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,179
regulations are going to be because at

907
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,038
the end of the day you're looking at

908
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,740
regulations that can be interpreted by

909
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:47,700
people and oftentimes those

910
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,859
interpretations can vary a little bit

911
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,919
they can be very strict or not so much

912
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:55,339
but in these markets I'm also looking at

913
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,720
Legacy I mean to me the existence

914
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:59,459
virtually every country has a legacy

915
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,919
Market cannabis is being grown in that

916
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,558
country somewhere and that's what the

917
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,360
legal markets tend to be built upon in

918
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,059
Canada the massive mistake that was made

919
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,679
was that the was the Legacy Market was

920
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:13,679
rejected out of the program they were

921
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,139
left out completely and so we have a lot

922
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,659
of folks coming in to try to try to make

923
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:20,280
this this work grow grow cannabis I mean

924
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,858
took Canada four or five years to really

925
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,440
get up to a decent quality and Cadence

926
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:26,759
with this cultivation

927
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,918
largely because the Legacy Market was

928
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,859
rejected so I look at the Legacy Market

929
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,658
how is the jurisdiction approaching that

930
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:35,639
again I look at the things I mentioned

931
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,820
earlier and then all the way through to

932
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,760
the import export side of it obviously

933
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,919
supply chain is really really important

934
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,300
um don't believe all that you read in

935
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,878
the supply chain analysis is

936
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,500
exceptionally important and last thing

937
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,719
I'll mention is I really believe

938
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,539
strongly like I don't know everything at

939
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:57,598
all I learn every day and I rely on

940
00:34:54,539 --> 00:35:00,300
experts in these various narrow domains

941
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,859
you know so I I go to people that are

942
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,320
smarter than me with respect to the

943
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:07,619
supply chain that's all they do or with

944
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,240
prescribers or with clinics and this

945
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,220
kind of thing these are the that's very

946
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:12,598
very important to focus on you cannot

947
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,279
just think that you're going to read and

948
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,859
understand you've got to go to the

949
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,380
experts in those narrow areas well as a

950
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:21,539
long-term Legacy operator I certainly

951
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,160
appreciate your respect for the wisdom

952
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:24,358
and the experience from those of us that

953
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,179
have been in it for decades before

954
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:29,400
regulation continuing to have a a key

955
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:33,118
place in the the new Global industry

956
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,338
okay I want to switch and talk about a

957
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,960
couple of my favorite subjects so I want

958
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:38,119
to talk about social justice and

959
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,099
sustainability

960
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:44,838
I'm wondering in both New Zealand and

961
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:47,519
Australia if there is conversation about

962
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:50,039
how to include your indigenous

963
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,858
populations that were disproportionately

964
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,838
punished by prohibition and if they are

965
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:56,098
on ramping into the industry and if

966
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:58,619
they're going to reap some of the

967
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:01,559
benefits of regulated cannabis

968
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,180
yeah so in New Zealand I think we're

969
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,699
working on that there's still work to do

970
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,259
but if I go back to the beginning where

971
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:09,299
our regulations came in I think there's

972
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,000
some nice examples of where we've been

973
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,119
able to pave the way for those that

974
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,280
maybe have been disproportionately

975
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:18,358
punished in the past there's two things

976
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,820
in New Zealand that are really

977
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:24,239
interesting around this one is that we

978
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,859
can transition illicit genetics into the

979
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,959
legal medicines Market through a

980
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:31,199
declaration process with our Ministry of

981
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,119
Health and so those Legacy strains where

982
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,399
people have been accessing that often

983
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,280
medicinally are able to come into a

984
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,500
legal framework and then the other point

985
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,660
is really something that was petitioned

986
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,000
before my time before I came into the

987
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:48,059
industry but that the founders of the

988
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,699
industry across across the industry

989
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,159
really pushed for was around those with

990
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:55,919
criminal charges being allowed into the

991
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:59,098
industry or not and I know this was a

992
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,780
contentious discussion at the time but

993
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,579
in New Zealand those that have had

994
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,380
previous convictions for cannabis can

995
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:07,200
work in the industry and I think that

996
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,760
this opens the doors to some people to

997
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,739
be able to transition across and we've

998
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,079
seen some examples ready to move to New

999
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:15,118
Zealand I'm sold

1000
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,320
um Peter can you add just very quickly

1001
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,000
because we're getting close to the end

1002
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,740
if you want to comment anything about

1003
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,079
on-ramping and including your indigenous

1004
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,399
populations in Australia I think we

1005
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,660
should look at what they're doing in New

1006
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,880
Zealand they've done it really well

1007
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,500
we've got a big issue in Australia this

1008
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,640
year with the referendum that's

1009
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,039
happening around the voice for

1010
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,618
indigenous people and unfortunately

1011
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:37,259
unfortunately that's become politicized

1012
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,240
um I'm hoping Australia doesn't miss the

1013
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,980
opportunity to take the first step there

1014
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,078
which should be to give them a voice so

1015
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,780
that's my position and I'll happily put

1016
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,000
that out there but yeah no there's still

1017
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,980
a lot more to do and what about

1018
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,780
sustainability reporting is there

1019
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,940
conversations in your countries about

1020
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,500
requirements for starting to report on

1021
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,420
your carbon footprint and your other

1022
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,639
Environmental kpis

1023
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,880
there are it's it's definitely a focus

1024
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,559
and for a number of the research bodies

1025
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,000
and universities involved in some of the

1026
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,920
work we're doing I think that's going to

1027
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,280
be a real Focus for the for the next

1028
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,559
stage but there's a long way to go on

1029
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,720
that too but it's definitely high on the

1030
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,219
agenda in Australia and I'm just going

1031
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:19,439
to take one minute to say that any of

1032
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:22,078
you that are operating in the EU it

1033
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,880
would be good to have a look at the

1034
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,740
corporate responsibility or the

1035
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,358
corporate sustainability reporting

1036
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,459
disclosures that were passed in April

1037
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,559
because pretty much all small and

1038
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,019
medium-sized Enterprises working in the

1039
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,078
Cannabis industry in Europe are going to

1040
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:38,219
be required to be doing very significant

1041
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,740
sustainability reporting in the next two

1042
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:43,379
years including reporting on scope 3

1043
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:45,179
which means the impact of your supply

1044
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,740
chain so your partners are going to need

1045
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:48,719
to be able to be doing their data

1046
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:50,039
collecting and their reporting this is

1047
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,139
something that I've been researching and

1048
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,699
I'm super passionate about making sure

1049
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:55,858
that the folks in our industry are sort

1050
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,419
of waking up and getting prepared to do

1051
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:59,880
this kind of work because you don't want

1052
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,800
to be scrambling to do it at the in the

1053
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,900
last moment it becomes very complex and

1054
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,220
expensive to do if you're scrambling so

1055
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,059
if you want to talk about sustainability

1056
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:11,039
reporting come and find me the last

1057
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:13,400
thing that I want to do is I just want

1058
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:16,920
to give each one of you an opportunity

1059
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,900
to essentially tell the audience like

1060
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,358
why did you come to ICBC and what are

1061
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,858
you looking for so in terms of the

1062
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,358
connections you're trying to make the

1063
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:25,679
partners that you're trying to make if

1064
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:27,119
you want to buy something or sell

1065
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,858
something for the folks that are in the

1066
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,539
audience who are the people that you

1067
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:33,199
would like to come and talk to you when

1068
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:36,358
our panel is over

1069
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:38,219
yes so I think for Australia with the

1070
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:40,078
the recent changes to the legislation

1071
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:41,939
people understanding that the

1072
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,039
opportunity for medicinal cannabis is a

1073
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:47,519
global one getting cannabinoids into

1074
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:49,440
human health um is the the key Focus

1075
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,900
I think that's the key message for

1076
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,400
Australia I think the the prereq

1077
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,400
discussion around what's happening in

1078
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,920
that flower space and moving too quickly

1079
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,559
to a recreational Market would would

1080
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,619
really damage getting the clinical work

1081
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,960
and the science done so that's one of

1082
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,519
the challenges we've got but we want to

1083
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,659
move the whole thing forward and and

1084
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,420
having

1085
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:14,338
confidence in and not undermining uh

1086
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,559
confidence is is really a key part of

1087
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:18,358
the the focus so being aware of what's

1088
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,259
happening in this part of the world and

1089
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:24,858
vice versa is why we're here for ICBC

1090
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,859
Carmen

1091
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,320
I think this is a two-way street in

1092
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,880
terms of what we are asking for

1093
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,680
um so I've found some great Partners

1094
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,539
already to bring our New Zealand grown

1095
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:38,699
New Zealand made medicines to this side

1096
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:41,219
of the world but if you are looking for

1097
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:43,858
a super high quality medicine then stop

1098
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:45,480
by the New Zealand Booth Booth 383 and

1099
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,000
have a chat to me or some of the other

1100
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,619
New Zealand companies that are here

1101
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,800
we're looking for Partnerships and

1102
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,320
distribution pathways the other part in

1103
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,539
terms of the the two-way street in terms

1104
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,359
of what I'm looking for is as we are

1105
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,219
growing the industry quickly for us at

1106
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,619
Helios we are looking for people who

1107
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,659
might want to come to New Zealand I know

1108
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,700
it's a really tough sell to move to New

1109
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:11,179
Zealand Hillary's coming already

1110
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:14,338
um but I can bring my dog right

1111
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:17,039
we're looking for people with EU GMP

1112
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:19,980
experience and highly controlled indoor

1113
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:22,619
grow or an extraction that might want to

1114
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,838
come and spend six months or a year or

1115
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:27,660
maybe even longer in New Zealand and

1116
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,219
help us to accelerate our industry so

1117
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:31,019
that we can deliver more products to

1118
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:32,819
more patients around the world so I

1119
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:34,079
think we could um we could show you a

1120
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,359
good time in New Zealand and we could

1121
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,820
also learn from some people who've been

1122
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:41,819
there and trod the path before well said

1123
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,440
and David let's talk about the services

1124
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,059
that you offer and the partners that

1125
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,920
you're looking for here yeah I mean it's

1126
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:48,420
a B2B conference obviously we attend

1127
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,280
patient conferences and the focus

1128
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,358
there's a bit different this is B2B

1129
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,920
which is going to make my remind

1130
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,440
approximately focus in that direction

1131
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,940
where we really recognize the lack of

1132
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
capital in the market and that's what a

1133
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,480
lot of people are telling us whether

1134
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,039
it's clients friends Associates then

1135
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,838
they're struggling to get access to

1136
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,338
Capital and in that environment you've

1137
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,559
got to be a lot more creative a lot more

1138
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:09,779
Nimble so our work is based around

1139
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,179
navigation we help people to navigate

1140
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,859
access to Capital we help people to

1141
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,019
navigate creative ways to get their

1142
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:17,519
products into Global markets that's kind

1143
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:20,880
of where we where we operate we're at

1144
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,259
Booth 345 and happy to talk we're a team

1145
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,240
of four people there and love to talk to

1146
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,500
anyone that wants to come by it's been

1147
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,939
such a pleasure getting to know the

1148
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,619
three of you as we prepared for this

1149
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,480
conversation and you're stuck with me

1150
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,579
for life now we're going to be lifelong

1151
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,440
friends I look forward to continuing to

1152
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,140
collaborate and thank you for this

1153
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,380
