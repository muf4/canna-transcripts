00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,560
Networking is important in any business, but  particularly in cannabis because everybody's new,  

2
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,079
so we can have telephone calls with  one another. We can do zoom calls.  

3
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,320
Nothing beats face-to-face contact. I  feel like the ICBC is the right place  

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
to do it because it's an intimate  environment. I love this conference.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,000
Traditional networking for me works via LinkedIn,  

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,640
via conferences, but these people don't. They  tend to be more discreet, so I'm here to see them.  

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,679
What makes ICBC special for me - it's  a conference that focuses on investment  

8
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:57,839
and it's probably the only one that's  face-to-face today, so that's important.

9
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
I'm here at the ICBC conference  to be part of the European market,  

10
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
and the you know, the cannabis industry  is developing a lot in Europe as well.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,400
We will be a premium player. That's the only niche  that I see, that we can sustain. Networking is  

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,680
critically important in the cannabis industry  because we are all facing the same issues. At  

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,480
the end of the day we face cost pressure,  we face issues with legislation, we are  

14
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,680
waiting for liberalization in a lot of areas, and  therefore we need to stick together. We need to  

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,520
network, we need to learn from each other and work  as an industry and not as a single enterprise.

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,560
It is one of the longest-standing sophisticated  event organizations, uh, with a history in North  

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,640
America that has done an incredible job in setting  up in Europe, and giving us: those not necessarily  

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
in Europe access. So a gateway to better  understand these emerging markets across Europe.

19
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,840
One of the most important functions of the ICBC  is that being the first international cannabis  

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
business conference, it wasn't like a high time  show. Like, let's get together and all smoke weed  

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,680
and talk about how amazing the plant is. It's like  how can we use business and finance and compliance  

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,920
to actually create the businesses that are going  to get medicine to people, start the adult-use  

23
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,719
program, get the right investors into these  programs - because without the ICBC, I mean,  

24
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,479
that's hundreds of companies we wouldn't have  been able to work with or new opportunities,  

25
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,840
so every day I'm just honored and humbled to be  able to share what I know with this community.
