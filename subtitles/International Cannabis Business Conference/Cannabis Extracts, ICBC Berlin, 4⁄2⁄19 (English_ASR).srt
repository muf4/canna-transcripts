1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,008
well the panelists are entering the

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:09,839
stage I want to thank you for coming to

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:13,798
our extraction panel and may introduce

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,449
to you David LaRussa from sales director

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:20,969
from ethics hey David

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:26,698
then we have bins I know we have we have

7
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:29,549
Zack is from SL a companies then we have

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,399
P Pettersen from Vitelli extraction hi

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,700
Pete at last what the LeaseWeb mikemaya

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,689
from lab Society in California hi Mike

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,700
and before I introduce the panelists in

12
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,259
detail to you I want to a give a short

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,930
overview what we're going to talk about

14
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,968
now in the panel before you had a lot

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,628
about extracts you're at a lot about

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,510
standardization we have a very specific

17
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:56,789
problem here in Germany because the

18
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,339
whole plant extracts did not reach our

19
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,750
pharmacist yet what we have in the

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,540
pharmacies is does a modern one we call

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,519
it mono substances which is a drawer

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,560
nominal which is a mono substance and as

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,798
it was mentioned before we have Sativex

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,400
and we have just one whole plant extract

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,729
which is very new in the pharmacies or

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,920
now it's two offered by a Canadian

27
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:26,429
importer by a Canadian producer but

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,790
except that only private persons know

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,530
anything about extraction there is the

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,530
knowledge within the cannabis industry

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,829
here the extraction knowledge is not

32
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,930
very widespread and so far different

33
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:43,618
from the US and from Canada it's on a

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,799
very private level which gives which

35
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:49,319
makes a big problem when it comes to

36
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,930
through the medical use of extracts a

37
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,548
lot of patients know better than their

38
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,040
doctors and know better than their

39
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,290
pharmacists because they know the

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,320
extracts from the private from from the

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,049
black market or from extracting the

42
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,118
medical weed they get privately I know a

43
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,219
lot of people privately who do make for

44
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,709
example who extract their bedrock on

45
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,180
cannabis make a whole plant extraction

46
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,479
because this is not offered in the

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,920
pharmacy and they

48
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,289
only can get that strain that

49
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,658
specifically trained in the form of bats

50
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:21,789
and if you need an extraction you have

51
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:25,090
to do it on a private on a private level

52
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:28,539
so I'm very proud to present you five

53
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,479
expert four experts on extraction any of

54
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:34,298
them using a different approach to

55
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,250
extract medical cannabis and I'm a

56
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:40,329
little sorry if I used to have to read

57
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:43,060
that I have to use my crib because I had

58
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,939
a second I have two panels today and to

59
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,120
introduce anybody as he deserves I do

60
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:54,098
have to use microwave I'm so I want to

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:57,099
start with a David and David love itself

62
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:59,768
director epic super critical a leading

63
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:00,459
seals co2 extraction manufacturer based

64
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:02,980
in Ohio

65
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,750
Dave directs the sales team at epics

66
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:07,530
help streamline and implement processes

67
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,870
to help improve the customers experience

68
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,318
and as we talked in the green room

69
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,359
before the meeting here before the panel

70
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:19,629
you cannot you don't have products in

71
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:24,219
your state yet but you're actually

72
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:27,430
focusing on producing or on the other

73
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:30,219
technique behind it and my first

74
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,870
question goes out to you and your

75
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:35,829
companies specialize in focus on

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:39,069
developing supercritical co2 technology

77
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:41,379
on an industrial level and a lot of

78
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:43,238
especially in Germany we're not so

79
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,668
experienced with extraction can you

80
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,680
maybe give a short overview what is Z or

81
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:51,250
to extraction how does it differ from

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,939
the alt place of instruction we know so

83
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:58,989
far so co2 extraction is the extraction

84
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:02,579
using co2 solvent taking co2 from a gas

85
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:05,378
to liquid at high pressures thus

86
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,200
extracting the oils the waxes and the

87
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:12,429
lipids and then removing those from the

88
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:14,738
actual plant material at Apex we focus

89
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,129
on introductory systems but also

90
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,959
scalable to industrial size and with our

91
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:22,509
systems we actually operate them on the

92
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,769
same platform so as customers scale

93
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,899
their business and grow their business

94
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:27,279
it's it's an easy transition from going

95
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:30,659
from a introductory system

96
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:33,969
to a medium system to the large system

97
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,980
so as a producer of extraction

98
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,650
technology you don't only you have a

99
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,710
bigger overview what's going on so how

100
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:43,719
did the demand for cannabis extracts

101
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:47,138
develop in the US and the Canadian

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,220
market within the last year's so the

103
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:55,199
obviously I started off on the west and

104
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:58,710
with the demand for cannabis and hemp

105
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,060
actually and II was approached by the

106
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:04,479
select customers and they wanted another

107
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,810
method of actually extracting through a

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,610
cleaner purer process which would then

109
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,480
ultimately reduce the amount of post

110
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,819
processing time and refining it and to

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,890
come back to what I said in the

112
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:20,319
beginning this is also a technique you

113
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,800
cannot use on private and small level is

114
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,870
that true correct and which is very

115
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,050
different from your technology attack

116
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,269
isn't it and let me introduce that first

117
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:37,660
Zak is based based in California and

118
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:39,430
he's the VP of frozen tech for their

119
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,160
products a California based industry

120
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,038
leading solvent liske extraction company

121
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,360
solvent list what does that mean solve

122
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:51,819
alice is just heat and pressure so we do

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,490
rosin presses rosin tech products and

124
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:58,180
you take your flour or your dry sift

125
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,400
your ice water hash and you are setting

126
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,620
your temperature your time putting your

127
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,288
material in a filter bag within the

128
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,840
parchment paper and then you're pressing

129
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:10,000
for about 30 to 60 seconds and you're

130
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,659
getting your solvent les hash oil or

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,959
your rosin so with with the rosin it's

132
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,860
full-spectrum and it's just a matter of

133
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:24,819
taking your material and then whether

134
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,030
you're whether you're doing co2 or

135
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:30,699
you're doing BHO you're always using a

136
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:34,449
solvent with solvent lists you don't

137
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:37,810
have to worry about that at all and when

138
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:40,998
it comes to the medical team and yet in

139
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,879
Germany this honey technique is act

140
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:47,119
unknown when it comes to medical

141
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:50,209
production what about your home yes so

142
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:52,189
with rosin it's very affordable

143
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:55,459
in terms of extraction it's very easy to

144
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:57,739
get started and Germany to actually is

145
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:00,908
one of our largest countries that we

146
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:03,978
sell rosin presses to a lot of patients

147
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:07,639
want to be able to make their oil and

148
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:08,959
it's very easy and a rosin press is

149
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:15,259
pretty small so you can keep it on your

150
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:17,899
counter and you know as as it basically

151
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,309
rosin started about ten years ago maybe

152
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,749
even a little bit longer

153
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:23,419
people started with hair straighteners

154
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:25,909
and now we've developed presses that are

155
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:30,109
just a little bit more pressure but that

156
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:31,848
allow you to get the oil with less time

157
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,049
under the heat which allows for greater

158
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:35,598
terpene and retention

159
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:39,228
so with rosin you get a really tasty end

160
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,269
product that with ice water hash is some

161
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:43,038
of the best oil out there on the market

162
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:45,379
ice water hash would be washing your

163
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,178
material putting it a freeze dryer and

164
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:51,769
then pressing it and getting her ice

165
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:54,198
water has frozen okay and this is also a

166
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:56,179
technique patients can use and they're

167
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,269
very small very small scale lookup thing

168
00:07:56,178 --> 00:08:01,218
yeah you can do it's a it's pretty it's

169
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:03,709
pretty much a connoisseur product out

170
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:06,709
there but we do work with a lot of

171
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:08,329
processors all over the world who who

172
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,709
are attracted to the idea of doing

173
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,838
solvent list like when you go into a

174
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:14,478
supermarket now and you look at your

175
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:17,418
shopping cart everything's organic with

176
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:20,688
solvent lists and consumers and patients

177
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:26,498
are excited about the idea of having a

178
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:29,299
clean tasty turkey end product okay Pete

179
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:31,838
it's great to have you here you found it

180
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:35,629
Vitalis extraction technology back in

181
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:38,509
2016 and before you have 15 years of

182
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:40,668
experience in varying industries in

183
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:45,350
legal or retail manufacturing in

184
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:47,448
healthcare and when I did some research

185
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,149
on your homepage I found the following

186
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:52,039
before opening the doors on what what

187
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,320
become the leading manufacturer of an

188
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,409
industrial sized tube material

189
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:02,330
critical co2 extraction systems three

190
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:04,370
partners three partners who went out to

191
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,800
extract us and asked wherever that very

192
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,500
question the answer took them on two

193
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,349
year journey of research ideation and

194
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,120
development men may ask you to mention

195
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,830
the cornerstones of the answers you

196
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,659
found this is a sport there we go

197
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,040
so I came out of the private equity side

198
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,709
I don't know if we have anybody from the

199
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,730
finance world in here anybody interested

200
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,690
I guess everybody's interested in

201
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,740
extraction that's why you're sitting

202
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:33,470
here today I was a customer buying these

203
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,049
systems we looked at the space we want

204
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,009
to build just big gigantic machines is

205
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:41,929
kind of the approach that we took and

206
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:44,179
when we looked at so the determining

207
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:45,649
factors for these systems there's a lot

208
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:48,199
of information that's out there there's

209
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,149
you know with the APEC systems and Eden

210
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,280
and precision and all sorts of different

211
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,600
types of extraction we tried to say okay

212
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,409
how can we normalize that a little bit

213
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,779
and make it a little bit more

214
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:58,850
understandable so we looked at just the

215
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:01,250
pillars of extraction being temperature

216
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,529
pressure and flow over a certain amount

217
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,399
of time right so temperature and

218
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:09,289
pressures you can vary those depending

219
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,449
on the type of output that you want and

220
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:12,799
then increasing or decreasing your flow

221
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,990
rate so the amount of solvent that

222
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,269
you're adding to the equation to again

223
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,720
get a different type of result so our

224
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:23,269
talk track our acid bases of extraction

225
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,330
basis of research and design has been

226
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,429
around temperature pressure and flow and

227
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,080
in order to decrease the amount of time

228
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:34,549
that it takes to facilitate the

229
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:37,490
extraction and your company announced

230
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,559
the cooperation with America's CBD a

231
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,560
very because CBD oil producer and

232
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,839
despite hand farming in the USA is more

233
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,469
an exception than a rule and you can

234
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:52,670
produce on a a very large amounts and

235
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,220
how come and you explain big flow big

236
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:56,299
systems big vessels you guys are

237
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,300
probably seeing it as well I would

238
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:02,000
imagine since the the farm bill just

239
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:06,109
passed in December in the US that has

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,730
created a monster demand on the say CBD

241
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,318
extraction side of it

242
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,269
and we're also seeing that across Europe

243
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:14,088
right now CBD is becoming far more

244
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,369
popularized it seems to happen in tandem

245
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,350
when cannabis or marijuana is being

246
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,939
discussed and all of a sudden CBD is

247
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,168
just his brought up along the way even

248
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,308
though it's been available for quite a

249
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:24,678
period of time there's hundreds of

250
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:26,088
products as we've seen by a number of

251
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:29,178
different panelists there's hundreds of

252
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,919
products already in the industry yeah

253
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:32,328
really just when our customers

254
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:34,039
approached us especially with these

255
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:38,528
large hemp systems are looking for large

256
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:40,899
volume they're looking for just clean

257
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:43,909
efficient extraction processes and

258
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:46,909
that's that's really what's allowed us

259
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:49,368
to service that that side of the market

260
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:51,828
pretty significantly how would you

261
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:55,609
describe the ratio between CBD the

262
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:57,558
demand for CBD and THC so your personal

263
00:11:55,609 --> 00:12:00,019
experience from a company so right now

264
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:03,230
I'd say 40 percent of my customer base

265
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,688
is extracting from him and they're lying

266
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,519
the the much larger systems so we call

267
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:09,349
it the our 200 which is a hundred liter

268
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,239
extraction vessel and some of them will

269
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,909
stack you know three or four or five of

270
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:15,829
those side by side by side to be doing

271
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:19,608
you know a couple a couple thousand

272
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:23,778
kilos a day of hemp extraction oh thank

273
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:27,769
you thank you very much now I come to

274
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:30,528
our fourth toe of hot expert we he is

275
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:33,038
representing an other a technology

276
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:35,928
another method to make extraction

277
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:39,139
Michael is my Roth has graduated in

278
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:40,999
environmental chemistry and has been has

279
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,788
served his passion for developing kind

280
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,959
of a specific level laboratory equipment

281
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:49,159
into a multi-million dollar company and

282
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:54,858
yeah congratulations for that

283
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:57,948
and despite ease of quite young age he

284
00:12:54,859 --> 00:13:01,639
already found it yeah a lot of companies

285
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:04,928
and the your recent project is for

286
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,339
focusing on short path distillation and

287
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:10,488
how does that differ from the techniques

288
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,319
we we've had from so far and may I ask

289
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:15,048
you to explain that short path

290
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:17,208
distillation sure so um short path

291
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:18,649
distillation really is actually a method

292
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,058
of refinement so it actually works

293
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,139
really cohesively with all the

294
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,669
extraction methods that

295
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,068
discussed here today as well as other

296
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:27,078
methods of solvent extraction the nice

297
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:30,048
thing about distillation is that you can

298
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:31,878
essentially render any substance any

299
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:33,078
sort of extract solvent free in the end

300
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,920
which is great especially for

301
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,998
large-scale processing procedures so

302
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,278
through the distillation process we're

303
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:41,928
using heat and vacuum specifically deep

304
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,519
vacuum to lower the boiling point of

305
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:46,759
cannabinoids since they're typically

306
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,678
very viscous and very heavy so in order

307
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,359
to boil them off we lower our boiling

308
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:52,578
point using vacuum and then from there

309
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:54,319
we can use fractional columns or wiped

310
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:56,388
film distillation stills on the

311
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:58,159
continuous side especially with that

312
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:00,289
like Pete was saying with the farm bill

313
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,909
the scale has jumped tremendously we

314
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:04,278
started off with small units that we're

315
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:06,230
doing you know 1/2 kilo - you know our

316
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:08,778
largest small-scale system does about 12

317
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,789
kilos per batch to a system that does 10

318
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:12,139
to 20 kilos per our feed rate so

319
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,328
obviously it's a substantial difference

320
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:16,818
and then from there we're also looking

321
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:18,378
to scale from 50 to 200 kilos per hour

322
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:21,889
so we're talking about much larger

323
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,239
systems but the the true benefit to

324
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,759
distillation is the creation of a

325
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:27,798
standardized product so through product

326
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,688
development you know I believe in the

327
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,798
last talk they were mentioning that

328
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,178
there's just so many different

329
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:34,369
cannabinoids there's so much that we

330
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:36,470
need to know from the plant a nice thing

331
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:39,678
about distillation is that we can render

332
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,509
a cannabis extract that normally would

333
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,980
have terpenes and all these other things

334
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:46,339
in it we can render it as a sole

335
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,199
cannabinoid fraction which will have all

336
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,360
the candles present in the initial

337
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,458
strain the initial phenotype typical

338
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,438
expression of that plant and then from

339
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,268
there we can reintroduce terpenes and

340
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:58,639
other flavonoids and other compounds to

341
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,019
actually create an extract or a medicine

342
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,899
that is more directed towards a specific

343
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,639
illness the other great thing about this

344
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:06,828
delation is that you can work from a

345
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,568
distillate into isolates and using

346
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:10,578
isolates obviously there's some bad

347
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:12,198
connotation to that with depending on

348
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,668
what you're talking to on the medical

349
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,948
side which I completely agree with the

350
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:19,249
entourage effect is definitively a real

351
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:20,538
thing but the benefit of distillation is

352
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:23,058
that you can start with a very pure

353
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:24,918
product prior to these processes what

354
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:26,988
leads me to my next question because

355
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:30,259
done is started ization is a very very

356
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:32,389
important thing as we heard before if a

357
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:35,029
german patient enters a pharmacy and he

358
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,070
wants to have an extract he only

359
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:39,679
get to know the CBD and the THC content

360
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:44,020
that's all is your company able to

361
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:46,399
produce a whole spectrum a profile

362
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,899
absolutely so we we don't specifically

363
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,480
produce the products obviously we help

364
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:52,669
manufacturers and and prod and consumers

365
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,529
well really and processors produce

366
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:56,179
products for end consumers that would

367
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,860
have a wide spectrum of different

368
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:59,719
products the biggest issue right now I

369
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,550
think especially in America is just the

370
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,250
lack of standardization of process and

371
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:06,969
the analytical side so as a company

372
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:10,309
we've kind of pivoted towards analytics

373
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,170
standardization processing just really

374
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:14,449
trying to dial in our SOPs not only for

375
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,759
the GMP side but also for just the

376
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,320
analytical side there's a wide spectrum

377
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,750
of cannabinoids that all should be

378
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,700
recognized in medicines not only that

379
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,320
but the residuals solvent the pesticide

380
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,670
content the heavy metal content all

381
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,170
these things are really important for a

382
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:29,689
patient because if you're gonna say hey

383
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:31,370
this is a medicine well you know it

384
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,750
better be treated as such and in the

385
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,980
medical world these things are all

386
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:39,639
extremely important Dave let me ask you

387
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,200
a another question about standardization

388
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:45,319
your state you're coming from Ohio is

389
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,300
just in the phases of regulation you're

390
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,690
just regulating the medical cannabis

391
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:53,209
market correct and how important is

392
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,610
standardization for your company how

393
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,910
important is it without authorities for

394
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,399
the dialogue without authorities so it's

395
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:04,009
really important so one from the APEC

396
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,750
side selling the equipment we want to

397
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,759
make sure that we put the equipment in

398
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,920
the customers hands but they're getting

399
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,269
the right equipment so understanding the

400
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,180
standardization understanding of

401
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:16,460
regulations you know in the States right

402
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,400
now because it is federally illegal for

403
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,559
cannabis but states are legalizing it

404
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,750
they're making their own rules so we're

405
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:25,759
kind of taking a shot at the dark to

406
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,400
find out okay what rules can we follow

407
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,680
what rules do we have to abide by so the

408
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,050
idea of a standardization process will

409
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:37,370
help us you know provide the right

410
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:40,039
equipment to the customer and what would

411
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:44,000
you say if you look at the German

412
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:47,599
regulation system and compare it to the

413
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,029
American to the US regulation system in

414
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,799
Germany we have

415
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:54,889
good standardization but we don't have

416
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:57,440
any products in the u.s. the

417
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,360
standardization is not perfect but you

418
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,360
have products what is better in the end

419
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:06,229
what what do you say I think that the

420
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:07,819
standardization first and foremost then

421
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,920
this way we can follow the regulations

422
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:12,619
and then this way is it's consistent

423
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:17,300
across the board versus having variables

424
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:19,729
in different regions if I may add to

425
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:22,549
that being in Canada we've seen a little

426
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,049
bit of a mix between what's happening in

427
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,690
the European market as this market

428
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,950
evolves and then seeing on the US side

429
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,630
of things where you really estate by

430
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,269
state by state it's opening up how do we

431
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,760
approach this you know what levels of

432
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,410
standardization must be reached and then

433
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,200
in Canada because the Canadian market

434
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,910
really wants to reach into Europe and

435
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,190
start to sell there we was seeing kind

436
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,450
of a little bit of a hybrid model I can

437
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,890
tell you every single time I come over

438
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,539
to Europe I'm always impressed with the

439
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,220
the people that I sit down the customers

440
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:52,220
that were we're chatting with and

441
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,960
discussing extraction with it's not a

442
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,600
cowboy approach by any means of bringing

443
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,340
pharmaceutical experience to the table

444
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:00,079
and so they're asking questions about

445
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,759
GMP they're asking questions about

446
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,039
equipment certification with be IDI

447
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,930
they're making sure that you know

448
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,299
they're asking stuff about IQ &amp; oq and

449
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,070
PQ so installation qualifications

450
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:12,409
operational qualifications performance

451
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:15,769
qualifications and making sure that

452
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,779
their equipments gonna pass the stages

453
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:20,240
of the standardizations that your German

454
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,910
auditors are going to require to not

455
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,289
only make that medicine but to operate

456
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,360
the equipment that's going to make that

457
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,190
medicine at a standard level so

458
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,449
understanding what the what's

459
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,960
requirement to the European side of

460
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,610
things you the Europeans and some of the

461
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,559
Canadians were in the room and us in the

462
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:39,409
room but really the Europeans are

463
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,759
stepping up that level of same

464
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,220
manufacturing and that level of

465
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,960
compliance that the globe is now looking

466
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,960
to so it's really impressive to see

467
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,140
what's going on over here I'm when my

468
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,500
last next question goes out to expert on

469
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,420
the Canadian market as you maybe know we

470
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:01,519
have I think meanwhile 25 different

471
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,580
cannabis French and the pharmacy but

472
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,528
only one

473
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:07,710
all plant extraction from Canada so far

474
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:09,538
or not - why is that so it's just it's

475
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,980
just the like in Germany it's it's the

476
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:13,619
German regulations and the German laws

477
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,419
we typically see regulations start

478
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:16,979
wherever it may be it's the same thing

479
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,590
in the US when it starts state by state

480
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,450
by state and Canada started the same way

481
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:23,639
we start with flour it's easy to

482
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,440
understand it's easy to cultivate and

483
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,880
it's a Minimum Viable Product and so

484
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,830
that's introduced to the market first

485
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,778
and then from there you get some pretty

486
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:33,269
basic extracts if you look at the

487
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:34,648
Canadian extra action market the most

488
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:36,509
popularized ones are these little

489
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:38,788
tinctures where you have you know three

490
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:40,589
percent THC or three percent

491
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:43,710
cannabinoids and then the rest is

492
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:45,028
coconut oil or propylene glycol so the

493
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,669
patient in Canada actually has to

494
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:48,419
consume a lot of fluid to get they can't

495
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,120
have but knowing that they're looking

496
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,470
for however you know in a little bit

497
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,699
more of a conservative even we have a

498
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,620
liberal government and a little bit more

499
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,620
of a conservative society it is an

500
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:00,449
approach it's a step to administering

501
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,250
that medical cannabis and then we'll

502
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,190
start to see in Canada we'll start to

503
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,538
see that portfolio of extracts evolved a

504
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,028
little bit further but because it's

505
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:11,038
government lead it's federally led it's

506
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:13,619
very slow and it's very conservative and

507
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,509
Romney we say or some people complain

508
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,219
government is over-regulating the

509
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:19,259
medical cannabis law would you say huh

510
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,048
cannot us I mean yeah I'm not regulating

511
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,569
it no how can it is over regulating it

512
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,129
if there's any LPS in the room you guys

513
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:29,069
would also nod your heads there's a

514
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:32,130
heavy of a regulation however they are

515
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:34,710
commissioning committees and basically

516
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,990
public opinion to try to understand what

517
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,210
the public does want to see from that

518
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,308
component and also Health Canada I've

519
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,710
seen and and seen some of the Health

520
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:45,528
Canada regulators and representatives go

521
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,990
down to the US and go down to Colorado

522
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:51,750
California Washington Oregon for example

523
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,159
are some say some very established

524
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,169
states when it comes to the medical and

525
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,730
recreational markets to talk to them

526
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,038
about different products that have been

527
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:02,099
released it may be on the side where

528
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,720
maybe the US isn't regulated enough in

529
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:05,819
terms of you know some of the extracts

530
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,470
that may be allowed you can have a gummy

531
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:10,470
bear in the US that has a thousand

532
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:13,309
milligrams of THC if you eat that you're

533
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,500
you're on your ass for two days it's

534
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:20,029
so it's it's it's a conservative

535
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,799
approach as a patient I don't I to be

536
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,710
completely honest I never I've never

537
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:27,139
rolled a joint my entire life so edibles

538
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,430
were also scary to me I didn't know like

539
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,080
if I had one when was it going to kick

540
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,460
in what was it going to be like and

541
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,259
that's that's very normal for people

542
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,960
that don't consume cannabis and so

543
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:38,210
having a small approach a conservative

544
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,190
approach I think is going to build that

545
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:44,390
trust within that consumer brand or the

546
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:48,130
consumer market Zac when it comes to

547
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:51,110
consumer trust to building a brand and

548
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,140
we have seen that the other kind of

549
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:56,389
extractions are already available

550
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,370
somehow here on our market you're Roslyn

551
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,460
tech is I've seen it in Spanish social

552
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:04,359
clubs a lot meanwhile so that's a really

553
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,100
small revolution going on but actually

554
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:09,609
your product is not in the pharmacies

555
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:12,829
yet and it's not on the market here yet

556
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:15,709
so how do you see that what's the future

557
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:19,970
of frozen tech or frozen extraction in

558
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,650
Europe yes so overall right now it is on

559
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,660
the end consumer side and in the

560
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,680
cannabis clubs we're seeing a lot of

561
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,630
clubs in you know in Spain but also

562
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,529
interests in the Netherlands and other

563
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:34,730
places but we are seeing a lot of like

564
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,139
originally when we were getting started

565
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,289
in Europe about two years ago it was the

566
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:42,020
patient's reaching out patients you know

567
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:43,779
a stage four cancer looking to for an

568
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:48,710
affordable weight and get their oil

569
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:50,210
would contact us and and you know and

570
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,059
then tell their friends and that's kind

571
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,630
of how we got our start in Europe and I

572
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:58,669
think you know going forward rosin has a

573
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,680
very affordable way almost like having a

574
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,269
you know a juicer in your kitchen or

575
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,789
something like that that's how I

576
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:08,900
envision you know rosin in the future

577
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:12,440
for Europe being really popular for the

578
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,110
end consumers but also you know as we

579
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,720
head more towards the recreational side

580
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:19,639
in Europe down the road I hope to have

581
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,799
the salt and less experience like we do

582
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,050
in the US where you can bring your flour

583
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,899
well press for you for free and it's

584
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:30,440
just all out in the open and

585
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,120
all about education so yeah I think I

586
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,100
think down the road you're gonna start

587
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,079
to see more shows where you know there's

588
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:37,730
more pressing going on and people

589
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,159
bringing their buds and you educate them

590
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,799
whether it's CBD flower or with THC

591
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,860
yeah I've seen in it I've seen it the

592
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,899
envelope in Barcelona their father was

593
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:50,229
one booth this year I think they were

594
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,850
horrified Buddhism they were all crowded

595
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:56,029
and my last question because time is

596
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:58,490
really pushing us goes out to Mike we

597
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:02,359
never talked about terpene extraction so

598
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,920
far Mike and but terpene is also

599
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,779
something you can extract it's not only

600
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,840
caliber Nuits you also connect structure

601
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:10,730
pins well tell us something about that

602
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,109
please so terpenes obviously the boiling

603
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,519
point is going to be very different than

604
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:14,750
that of cannabinoids they're gonna the

605
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,519
reason that you smell them is because

606
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,220
they're boiling off they're you know

607
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,960
they're volatile so the extraction

608
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,089
methodology for that believe it or not

609
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,500
co2 actually is a fantastic way to

610
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:26,240
extract the terpenes I've seen some

611
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,420
extremely good terpene products come

612
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,609
from co2 extractors I would say that

613
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,230
equipment on scale which is really what

614
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:34,759
my business is focused towards is

615
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,339
difficult because when you start to talk

616
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,019
about terpene extraction at scale you're

617
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,789
involving heat you're involving pressure

618
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,970
which changes the actual terpene

619
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:46,099
structure itself so at that point it's

620
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,900
really a question of what scale who's

621
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:50,119
who's actually manufacturing this

622
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,370
terpenes and they are a very viable

623
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,709
product they also have medicinal aspects

624
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:56,689
to them and they I would say that

625
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,600
terpenes plus cannabinoids are really

626
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,039
the key to the the medicine itself but

627
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,719
as far as the extraction methodology

628
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,309
goes I would say the best extraction

629
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,579
techniques for getting the terpenes

630
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:09,589
would be co2 hydro carbon and actual

631
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:11,019
steam slash vacuum distillation

632
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:13,789
themselves

633
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,740
thank you very much I'd really really

634
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:18,829
like to go a lot to depend to the

635
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,329
materia but time is pushing so hard so

636
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:23,489
sorry let's hear it again for the panel

637
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:26,638
I do have one quick question

638
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:29,278
just because you mentioned the terpene

639
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:31,798
extraction and I've seen a lot of new

640
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,659
companies who specialize in terpenes but

641
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,038
they're not cannabis derived terpenes

642
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,109
they're like artificially not

643
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,210
artificially but creative they get

644
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:42,089
terpenes from somewhere other than the

645
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,679
cannabis plant are they the same is that

646
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,509
the same thing is it different or the

647
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,309
molecules different that's a fantastic

648
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:49,200
question the cool thing about cannabis

649
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:51,839
is that it has an array of terpenes

650
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,970
honestly to the for analytics on that

651
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,829
side we really have trouble determining

652
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,149
which terpenes are in the actual plant

653
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:59,788
because there's so many I mean there's

654
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:01,918
hundreds there might even be some that

655
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:03,898
are unique to the plant itself but what

656
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,249
you're discussing is that yes absolutely

657
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:10,229
they are the same molecules rosehips

658
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:12,239
orange peels eucalyptol eucalyptus

659
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,788
pretty much any plant that has a good

660
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:16,259
smell those terpenes may be found in

661
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:18,388
cannabis so what a lot of companies are

662
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,249
doing is they're taking extracts from

663
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:22,229
other plants that can be done at a much

664
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:25,319
larger scale efficiently mixing them

665
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,118
together to mix or to mimic Turkey and

666
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,319
sure clothes from smell the same it

667
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:30,959
tastes the same but will they have the

668
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,089
same effect that's that's the question

669
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,829
right so when you actually look at the

670
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:36,749
profiles on cannabis there's so many

671
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:38,339
small amounts of these terpenes that you

672
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:40,200
can't really get from other plants that

673
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,939
one in conjunction with each other they

674
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,278
make different effects so it's really

675
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,600
hard to say it's a really great field of

676
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:47,429
study I think that's gonna be something

677
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,128
that we really need to as an industry

678
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:52,230
push towards thank you thank you all

679
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:53,788
very very much I really appreciate it

680
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,329
let's hear it again for our panel very

681
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:56,329
informative
