2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,600
what we do is very simple if we only

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,600
want to be prepared inside of um

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,640
a conduction container and the unit

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,840
that's what we do nothing else so very

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,839
very very very niche

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,238
and there's always one regulation in

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,880
every market that hits us you know for

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,000
us no america is cool europe is tough

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
because

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
you can see in europe

12
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,878
okay so um

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,960

14
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,000

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,558
different perspective from a much larger

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,078

[Music]

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,040
is

25
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,639
thanks luke who is koski the chief

26
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,680
operating officer for a company called

27
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,159
metric and trc fbi

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,159
metric

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,879
i've been with the company for two and a

30
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:21,598
half years i came to accompany my way of

31
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,759
being a government regulator so i do

32
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,280
love regulations i'm sure you know you

33
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,199
do that good

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,759
good government

35
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,280
like comprehensive regulation and

36
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,560
official government is something we

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,000
don't hear in the same sense but

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
hopefully you have to talk a little bit

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,598
about that today and talked about

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
some more things that are happening in

41
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,479
the u.s but metric is a company

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,479
think of it as a centralized database

43
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,598
that the government uses

44
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,840
licensees report into that system

45
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,719
all of their

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,239
inventories how inventory is moving test

47
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,239
results

48
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
pull the sales information

49
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,878
that goes into that and then governments

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,120
can use that information to help

51
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,120
confirm compliance of licensed

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
businesses

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,319
in the industry so open software if you

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
all bought in something like this

55
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,399
well it's because it's interesting

56
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,840
because the united states is

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,840
probably the well the most advanced or

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
is the

59
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,080
oldest um professional cannabis market

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,200
that we have right now and uh in the

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,959
production campus space so if you just

62
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,039
write us some of the regulations that

63
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,120
you guys have on it and then we're gonna

64
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,079
talk about europe and i'm gonna mix it

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
all together and see what comes out

66
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,519
yeah so so just talk a little bit about

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,319
the u.s and big picture um our

68
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,799
regulatory framework across the us

69
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,759
is really kind of formulated from what

70
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,400
the government at the federal level has

71
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:54,079
done so way back when i first got into

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,680
uh canada's policy back in 2010

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
the federal government basically said

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,120
we're going to start enforcing

75
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,679
less

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
canvas violations by people that are

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,519
using it for medical abuse just by

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,280
looking at small comments publicly about

79
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
uh how they're going to take course in

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,120
action or not take for enforcement

81
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,079
action entire industry in the united

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,639
states started to formulate first with

83
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,639
medical uh frameworks and then later

84
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
with with adult use so that was kind of

85
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,680
the first thing the second thing that

86
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,439
the federal government did to do

87
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
anything which is regulate they can't

88
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,639
say on one hand this is completely

89
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
illegal federally we're not going to

90
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,280
prioritize enforcement we're certainly

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,400
not going to regulate the uh an illegal

92
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,638
substance that's a food product or

93
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,918
agricultural product so

94
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
they didn't do a lot of that so a lot of

95
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,198
regulations that formulated in the u.s

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
formulated by a state-by-state basis

97
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,879
with each state

98
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
interpreting what they think the federal

99
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,759
government would want and so as a result

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,439
we saw a lot of different regulations

101
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,280
based on whatever the important

102
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,360
priorities were for that state so if

103
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,359
they were more of a public health focus

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
state the rules really had to be

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,280
reflected in public health focus if it

106
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,359
was more of an enforcement or a law

107
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,799
enforcement type of posture the rules

108
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,038
tend to be a little bit more restricted

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,520
and reflect that and it was it was a

110
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,199
more of an industry-focused type of uh

111
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,719
environment while the rules tend to be a

112
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,720
little bit more permissive and reflect

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,800
that so across the country 35 states now

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,919
regulating cannabis in some way shape or

115
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
form

116
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,198
it's a

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,520
patchwork of different approaches

118
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,280
that have some dissimilarities and some

119
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,079
uniqueness to each market

120
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,478
but also some similarities as well

121
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,839
great interesting so

122
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,199
so every state is the cannabis industry

123
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,000
in itself

124
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,160
so can you is there like an interstate

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
market or is that

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
not legal

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,560
yes there is a interstate market it's

128
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,560
called the illicit market

129
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,799
cash regulated

130
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,758
itself all right then so um that's

131
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,918
that's that's the that's the u.s so

132
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,560
let's talk about europe

133
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,079
well in europe i think uh we do have a

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,280
chance now to make it a little bit

135
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,519
different and then the u.s is

136
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,279
not a federal government per se

137
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:32,359
we do have a federal government without

138
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,359
the european union now media is

139
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
so i guess it is up to us to actually

140
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,599
learn from what's been happening over

141
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,759
there uh and move closer together and

142
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,520
make sure that we find an online system

143
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,240
that allows us to then actually build

144
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,240
sustainable economics

145
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,159
then we have the whole situation in

146
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
europe we have all those different

147
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
standards and kind of at the end of the

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
day and that's the beauty of what you're

149
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,279
doing i think what we're doing is

150
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
through taking converts those gaps

151
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,839
between different kind standards

152
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,199
actually make something out of it that

153
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,279
is for everybody out there and through

154
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,840
that and kind of build the framework to

155
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,119
allow for industry

156
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,560
so

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,639
let's say here for a second so what

158
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,720
would you say are like the most

159
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,360
important

160
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,880
regulations that they are so if you were

161
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,400
if i wanted to i'm a cannabis grower not

162
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,439
from the listed market you know i want

163
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,758
to make some

164
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,839
i want to pay taxes on my team i wanted

165
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
to do that i wanted all things

166
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,038
um

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,319
i want to do it in europe so what are

168
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,240
the top

169
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,160
things that i have to look at

170
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,478
define europe

171
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,479
i want to sell here in germany now go

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
well i get a medical license you go

173
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,560
through the whole process in that space

174
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,280
and everything else is listed at the

175
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,959
moment so yeah it is

176
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,239
actually the end of the day medical is

177
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,239
the easiest because it's the one that's

178
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,000
most defined it's the one where you have

179
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,918
clear processes clear steps and you

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,160
follow those steps you actually have a

181
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,598
framework to put your business on where

182
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,000
in all the other markets that you work

183
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,079
with cbd is

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,720
0.263 united states this isn't that one

185
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,719
percentage

186
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,680
etc etc so all that confusion is

187
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,160
absolutely unnecessary that's not how

188
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,680
you look in this room

189
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,080
i agree um and i feel like one thing

190
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,519
that takes a um

191
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,080
for everybody makes everything much

192
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,639
easier is technology right so this is

193
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,959
for now since we're in an interconnected

194
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,039
world we have access to data and youtube

195
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,639
companies are based on data right that's

196
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,319
that's what makes everything more

197
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,600
transparent and easier

198
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,800
um can you can you like from from your

199
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
perspective

200
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,719
um what is

201
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,199
how does data help

202
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
you know in bridging like a business or

203
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,160
making the business more transparent

204
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,879
like very very concretely um but also in

205
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:12,240
when we talk about like across markets

206
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,919
you know how can data help and achieve

207
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,120
i think you appreciate that that

208
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,679
question so i think um when i when i

209
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
think about uh regulatory frameworks and

210
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,639
what makes them work really well first

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
and foremost you really have to have

212
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,278
some

213
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
cooperation from

214
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,639
all of the different stakeholders

215
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,278
they're going to be putting input

216
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,679
putting data into whatever the system

217
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,320
sounds like so

218
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,399
i recall very vividly in the u.s we work

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,040
very closely as a government official we

220
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,679
work very closely with a lot of

221
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,958
stakeholders from law enforcement from

222
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,039
local

223
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,479
government state government

224
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,319
federal government i mentioned earlier

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,720
was absent even though we liked them um

226
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,800
and we also had many industry members

227
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
and so we were able to collaborate on

228
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,559
what the

229
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,640
advocate amount of regulations was going

230
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,799
to look like so there's a lot of input

231
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,559
and a lot of insight into those

232
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,759
regulations i think most people felt

233
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,679
like they influenced some of the

234
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,838
probably people here that are spent time

235
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,479
in colorado they could verify that for

236
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,720
you in some way perform that said and

237
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,680
you have to have the right technological

238
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,160
structure to be able to collect the data

239
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,239
and what government chose to do in the

240
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,719
earlier years is to really

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
uh carefully monitor

242
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,639
all of the inventory that was coming

243
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,039
into the system

244
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,199
so as his plants were the immature

245
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,519
plants they started up in track and all

246
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,519
those inputs were collected along with

247
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,759
moving from one room to the next room

248
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,600
and um and then subsequent to that and

249
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,838
that would get harvested and start

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,079
moving its other products out to other

251
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,360
licensed premises and also ultimately

252
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,719
the consumer

253
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
and what we originally did that because

254
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,200
we were concerned about inversion or

255
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,958
diversion of

256
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,959
a product out of the

257
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,479
regulatory structure you start talking

258
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,639
about you know especially what we're

259
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,360
seeing in europe there's likely to be

260
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,360
commerce between member states the eu

261
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
etc um there's gonna be a lot of

262
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,600
interest in knowing what the profits of

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,680
that product is so you know where it

264
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,519
came from

265
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,159
hear your

266
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,560
data health be able to determine whether

267
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,600
or not that product that's coming into a

268
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:28,439
country is coming from another authentic

269
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,440
and well regulated uh industry

270
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,919
makes sense um

271
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,039
you're okay

272
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,039
well

273
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,919
data is one part of it

274
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,000
they are systems of building processes

275
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,199
and uh

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
[Music]

277
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
forward

278
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,518
combines only sounds like such a

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,759
daunting thing if there's an actual

280
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,959
framework behind it it can actually be

281
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,200
made in a very straightforward easy way

282
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,199
and uh

283
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,778
[Music]

284
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,078
another aspect of that for admission and

285
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,439
that is that

286
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,958
if government can lead the way and help

287
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,880
uh develop the right data framework it

288
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,879
gives birth to a lot of other commerce

289
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,019
[Music]

290
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,040
all of which use that data

291
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,278
um because it's collected you know in a

292
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,599
uniform way there's a single source of

293
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,000
truth that everybody can access

294
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,560
um with invitation but they can they can

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,958
access it and be able to utilize that to

296
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,958
run the

297
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,920
data companies compliance companies all

298
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,078
um integrate in with those data sets

299
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,838
that government have led the way in fact

300
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,199
in our system we have probably close to

301
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,000
500 companies that integrate into the

302
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,000
system and use the governance data

303
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,078
in some way shape or form

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,958
okay so you're saying that

305
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,638
as

306
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,239
do you customers have

307
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,759
access to

308
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,120
other companies data as well through

309
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,480
your system no

310
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,679
no okay so uh um even though the data

311
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
privacy those are different in the

312
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,120
united states obviously they haven't

313
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,599
been endured so you're not actually your

314
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,078
system is very secure when it comes to

315
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,480
the data um what happens though is like

316
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,239
take a point of sale company uh which

317
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
probably uses one of the economy in

318
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,720
terms of third-party

319
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,278
companies that agree with their system

320
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,278
and they have a business relationship

321
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,559
with dispensary aid

322
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,320
cultivation bee and manufacturer c

323
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,198
they would be able to with those

324
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,399
companies permission be able to exchange

325
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,958
data

326
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,639
from those systems so that the campus

327
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,879
businesses do not have to put the data

328
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,320
in twice and then make it more available

329
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,078
for the business systems that they use

330
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,680
on a day-to-day basis you wouldn't be

331
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,359
able to see any other data from any of

332
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,838
the other licensees unless you had that

333
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
relationship yeah okay so it's really

334
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,560
so

335
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,359
end-to-end

336
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,359
integration

337
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,240
you own that data so you collect it and

338
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,078
you can do something with it as a

339
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,440
company not we as a software company

340
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,078
like you as a competitor or

341
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,079
manufacturer's computer if you do

342
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,599
certain things in certified way you want

343
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,559
to be able to share that either with

344
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
your

345
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,599
client be made to decline or be able to

346
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,159
see clients so that having the power to

347
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,720
actually work with that data

348
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,639
school have been marketing so in the

349
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
class

350
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,600
and one

351
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,519
example that i'd like to kind of take is

352
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,199
in the beginning everybody was talking

353
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,198
about vertical integration vertical

354
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,240
integration with the whole supply chain

355
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,000
from 80

356
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,839
now we've seen in a couple of different

357
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,078
instances that might have been probably

358
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,000
the most successful business model and

359
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,879
specialization in different parts of the

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,720
supply chain basically become a very

361
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,399
daunting part of you every time you have

362
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
to completely move

363
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,120
all the all the traffic racing

364
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,249
everything that happened

365
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,249
[Music]

366
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,120
like businesses like ours allow

367
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,078
companies that basically are not

368
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,399
virtually integrated in one company or

369
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,198
horizontally integrated but that have

370
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,198
some complete

371
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:26,479
face different state standards and with

372
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,320
different country standards now and

373
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,278
we're currently working

374
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,040
you know

375
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,679
something that might be

376
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:37,039
the european um

377
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,039
medical side so you know

378
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,639
from your perspective and maybe also

379
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,399
from the certain customers if you want

380
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,639
to really become a globalized industry

381
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,679
what are the next steps so if you look

382
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,759
into the future what needs to be done

383
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,919
next in order to come you know from a

384
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,199
regulatory body well i mean we all have

385
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,000
to wait for

386
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,838
um

387
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
for governments to put their ads

388
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,078
together and do something about it sure

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,880
either the best in doing that probably

390
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,639
not

391
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,079
um but they have to do it at some point

392
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,079
but i mean

393
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,078
i think i feel like it's the industry's

394
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,120
agree um like the job

395
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,000
to steer them in the right direction

396
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,519
because we're the experts so to say so

397
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,599
what are the next few steps that have to

398
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,440
be taken away

399
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,918
and well it again it depends on the

400
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,919
different countries

401
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,400
[Music]

402
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,558
pilot projects which is i think a very

403
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,038
exciting approach to how communities are

404
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,279
performed we basically disorders this

405
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,960
government just opened up and said look

406
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,279
proposes something

407
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
come with an idea this is a study you

408
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,798
can propose

409
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,519
you can donate it has to be swiss

410
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,679
organic which is a different story but

411
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,639
at the end of the day it really allows

412
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,600
to study how can it actually be formed

413
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,520
how can it be brought out of the black

414
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,159
been cash collections as you mentioned

415
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,599
before how can different consumer

416
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,600
protection

417
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,839
safety standards and so forth also how

418
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,000
can people right with that market how

419
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,599
can you do that without just blocking

420
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,558
your

421
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,879
basically i think the next step is

422
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,839
now for countries that are allowed for

423
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,679
the industry to create social studies or

424
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,599
studies we're getting within a different

425
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,840
conference at first and then hopefully

426
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,839
studies

427
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
i really feel strongly that

428
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:07,599
industry participants

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,798
have a really significant role in

430
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,199
working hard to establish a credible

431
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,160
regulated framework and i'm hearing that

432
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,480
today from a lot of the speakers on how

433
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,160
important that is on a member state by

434
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,480
membership basis

435
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,640
so it's really it's kind of encouraging

436
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,960
to hear that you know i think some of

437
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,360
the more well regulated states in the us

438
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,519
have really um

439
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,359
lend themselves to that especially the

440
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,558
government side has

441
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:42,479
given that space for industry

442
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,319
to innovate and move quicker without

443
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,839
question having been both in the

444
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,639
government sector

445
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,879
and

446
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,919
now in the private sector the private

447
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,960
sector is much more capable of moving

448
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,799
quickly

449
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,880
and they're much more capable of really

450
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,038
kind of setting the standards

451
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,280
and so i think um to the extent that the

452
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,240
industry can really embrace a strong

453
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,000
regulatory framework um that allows for

454
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,359
competition that

455
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
allows for

456
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,359
some comprehensive regulation with some

457
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,480
efficient governance which i know again

458
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,918
is not

459
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,279
intuitive it's kind of much

460
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,720
counterintuitive in fact but to kind of

461
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
position the industry in such a way

462
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,279
where they can really help the

463
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,439
government lead

464
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,759
everyone to the balance of the policy

465
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,558
you can protect public health you can

466
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,279
protect public safety while also

467
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,879
allowing for greater business interests

468
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,839
to thrive within that regulatory

469
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,320
framework but the industry itself really

470
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,038
has to have saved what public health and

471
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,279
safety is too and typically historically

472
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,679
what we see in regulation on many

473
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,200
different regulatory frameworks i uh

474
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,600
study this as part of my doctoral

475
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,600
studies was was trying to

476
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,799
come up with ways for industry to help

477
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,519
determine what public health and safety

478
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,400
is rather than distrusting their

479
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,679
private interests suggesting money and

480
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,240
i'm hearing today it's really

481
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,840
interesting on a couple of the uh

482
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,240
panels where we were talking about

483
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,879
really focusing on patients or really

484
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,279
focusing on consumers rather than having

485
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,280
them

486
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,600
i agree this is why i think

487
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,839
what the acm is doing with the meetings

488
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,279
with their brain being experts from all

489
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,918
fields

490
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,678
in order to forge they're not i mean

491
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,240
it's not a regulation

492
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
it's more like standard it's not it

493
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
might be

494
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,080
a part of the law because a lot of like

495
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,960
lawmakers they refer to companies or

496
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,720
organizations such as astm when it comes

497
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,480
to creating regulations

498
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:48,159
um but i think initiatives like acms

499
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,880
doing will really help to to move this

500
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,760
and industry to really into a global

501
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,360
future

502
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,960
so i think we have just a couple of

503
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,549
minutes left i'm not mistaken are there

504
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,608
any questions maybe

505
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,608

yes

hello thank you for sharing with us my

metric

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,640
and this question may be particularly

513
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,558
for you

514
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,280
what do you see

515
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,480
the greatest opportunity and challenge

516
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,319
for europe

517
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,240
when it comes to this idea of

518
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,439
[Music]

519
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
crafting

520
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,360
uh this regulatory infrastructure so

521
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,679
that it can lead

522
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,119
to better information sharing when we

523
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,280
look at the us

524
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,079
and the opportunities and challenges

525
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,720
that we have there

526
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,158
thanks for the easy one i guess it was

527
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
hard i was going to refer to luke

528
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
because he knows the european market

529
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,359
much better than anybody so so just what

530
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,918
i'm learning because i think one of the

531
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,240
biggest challenges is that

532
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,200
member states within the european union

533
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,200
obviously system in the uk they're gonna

534
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,400
be more they're they're gonna have their

535
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,480
own

536
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,080
public health and safety priorities and

537
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,120
i also have their own priorities with

538
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,038
the reflect with prospective type of tax

539
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,239
revenues that they want to bring in so

540
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,400
being able to find some common ground

541
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,679
between all of the member states that is

542
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,679
going to be a challenge when i start

543
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,440
thinking about how different countries

544
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,798
are approaching it

545
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,159
just assume that i'm right about this

546
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,240
but i think there are some countries

547
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,480
that are more interested

548
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,720
in exporting cannabis

549
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,360
outside their boundaries or others are

550
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,679
maybe more interested in a tourism

551
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,759
type of uh

552
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,000
business that customer type conversation

553
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,400
criminal disease i've been trying to be

554
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,440
able to harmonize all of those

555
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,480
and create systems that allow for

556
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,759
uniqueness of public policy priorities

557
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,599
but also

558
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,519
allow all of the member states so people

559
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,119
to work together really closely again

560
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,480
and i think

561
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,000
i don't i don't think really well but i

562
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,400
don't need technology data and

563
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,880
those types of companies really have the

564
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,679
potential to help bridge that gap and in

565
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,080
a lot of ways i think government has the

566
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,320
right could have the right ideas but

567
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,278
maybe not the ability to execute on

568
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:23,759
those uh high level data and technology

569
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,960
needs and so companies like ours

570
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,759
can certainly help bridge that gap

571
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,120
i think another big part is that

572
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,119
systems are standards

573
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,359
[Music]

574
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,720
just choose one of them that is out

575
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,639
there it works for every other

576
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,038
agricultural good they train that all

577
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,360
around the world in safety health health

578
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,000
safety standards consumer safety it's

579
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,439
all guaranteed just basically choose one

580
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,640
of them they're all the same more or

581
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,309
less

582
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:08,599
anyways

583
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:08,598
[Music]

584
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,200
the day a lot of it is there

585
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,798
to mix it together and

586
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,278
create something that works for all of

587
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:21,278
you and uh

588
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,919
well

589
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,278
i would doubt that the regulatory body

590
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,080
would try to be

591
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,000
usually

592
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,319
what's up there already

593
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,480
yeah sorry about this

594
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,678
um i i agree so any more questions yes

595
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
right here

596
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,798
beautiful um specifically lewis uh you

597
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,720
mentioned it's very helpful to have

598
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,720
states that are already on board and

599
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,038
stakeholders involved in the process to

600
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,600
implement attraction what do you do with

601
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,319
the oklahoma's world where resistance is

602
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,240
going to equal persistence and how do

603
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,000
you get those uh maybe traditional

604
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,798
american markets to

605
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,519
get

606
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,759
and

607
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,759
you know catch up to the standards that

608
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,119
are out there which almost happens like

609
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,119
for your brains mentality

610
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,840
i mentioned earlier that there's there's

611
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,519
some uniqueness to all the states the

612
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:28,319
u.s states happily approached it

613
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,000
one thing that i also feel strongly

614
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,319
about when it comes to differences is

615
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
that there isn't just one way to

616
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,119
approach this i think it's more about

617
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,960
how

618
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,839
good

619
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,079
getting all the government

620
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:44,000
stakeholders engaged so when i think of

621
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:46,480
states like oklahoma i mean

622
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,119
they decided to take an approach where

623
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,880
there's um less barriers to creating so

624
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:54,079
they have a large licensee base so that

625
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,360
will take some time for it to evolve um

626
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,359
into a more mature market

627
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,278
all right do we have time for one more

628
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,240
let's go for one more maybe is there one

629
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,880
more

630
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,880
one more here we go

631
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:25,359
what are their thoughts about

632
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,558
fda establishing grandfather products in

633
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,759
some way

634
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:32,000
maybe for july 2009 when they said well

635
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,960
the deadline in 2007

636
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,119
and and everything from that point on

637
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,529
will need a submission do you see that

638
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,598
happening

639
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,598
[Music]

640
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,840
i would have to say probably not and and

641
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:51,679
probably more because the variety of

642
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:54,240
product is so great right so for example

643
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,640
you have chocolates you have

644
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,038
um cookies you have

645
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,759
other confections those are

646
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,519
not likely to just simply get a pass

647
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,679
because federal legalization comes

648
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,278
around but they did something that

649
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,278
everyone's really concerned about i

650
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,079
think there's a lot of things

651
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:16,079
to consider when we talk about federal

652
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,079
legalization how great it is

653
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,480
perhaps

654
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,798
you start talking about others that have

655
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,038
you know various regulations um you

656
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,480
could essentially be giving

657
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,798
cannabis

658
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,720
licensees or businesses a competitive

659
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,960
advantage over other businesses that

660
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
have to live up to that regulation

661
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,759
that they've been

662
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,759
working with for years

663
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:55,158
all right all right thank you very much
