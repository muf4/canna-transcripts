1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,960
so a lot's changed here recently in the

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,719
last three years

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,480
before cannabis was awesome just because

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,239
it was cannabis now we've got like

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
global market shifting different changes

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,879
in policies supply chain issues that

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,278
we've never even seen before so great we

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,960
can all be in a room again together yay

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,640
that's kind of an exciting thing

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,118
uh just a quick little disclaimer i have

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,960
to give i'm not a lawyer i'm not a cpa

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,879
i'm not an investment analyst i'm a fund

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,558
manager of multiverse capital own a

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,799
variety of companies

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,879
but make sure that you use good lawyers

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,238
good tax accountants because at the end

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
of the day

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,238
this is in the united states federally

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,000
illegal internationally

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,399
completely in contrary to all drug

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,238
policies and laws and we're breaking

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,920
rules in different jurisdictions so you

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,119
have to know what you're doing

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,320
you cannot guess and those professionals

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,839
they're kind of guessing too but a

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,198
little bit more educated than some of us

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
so just make sure to use some of those

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:03,039
professionals i do swear often

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,599
just in the nature and if i do offend

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,400
your company or country it's just based

31
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,759
on the industry it's nothing personal

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
a quick little high level of background

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,719
i've been in the space for almost 16

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
years

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,560
from farm country in wisconsin

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,118
all the way to being a linguist for the

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,759
military got hurt went to colorado to

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,159
some beautiful mountains in 2006

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,920
right when colorado was changing from a

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320
medical program that allowed commercial

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
production so colorado was the first

42
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,919
state in the united states that allowed

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,079
you to actually profit with medical

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,879
cannabis in 2008.

45
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,559
california 2000 or i'm sorry 1996 the

46
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,280
compassionate care act

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
first medical state in the us but we

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,439
were the first ones that we could do it

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,519
as a business not as a non-profit

50
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,919
little behold we were also the first

51
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,158
that allowed adult use cannabis so in

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,799
2012 we legalized regulate marijuana

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,600
like alcohol prop 64.

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
2014 we had the first legal adult use

55
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,078
sales where you could have a company

56
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,438
profiting

57
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,279
you know from adult use cannabis and

58
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,559
that day one of our stores was the third

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,079
to open

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
and that was the day like we had lawyers

61
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,280
on retainers it was the first time it

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,399
wasn't medical and like if the feds were

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,400
going to come in

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,360
that was the moment

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,280
they didn't

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
we did millions of dollars in revenue

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,598
colorado's already done 10 billion

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,200
dollars in adult use sales i won part of

69
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,959
an adult use business for over eight

70
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
years in colorado

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,120
profiting from cannabis

72
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,000
violating federal law

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
where are they so i have been around

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,919
seen a lot so i'm not guessing in some

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,879
of these assumptions

76
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,238
global cannabis in 2022 some of the

77
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,719
projections

78
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,640
when you think about last year over 35

79
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,759
billion dollars in revenue global

80
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,079
cannabis

81
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,518
medical and adult use

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,560
when you think of like where was that

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
revenue

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,439
88 in the united states

85
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,518
we're fed really illegal

86
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,439
i mean canada

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,680
nine percent i mean they barely like top

88
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,759
out around three billion us

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
canadian it sounds a lot better but uh

90
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,560
you know

91
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,839
and it used to be we had to be careful

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
talking about dollars and euros but

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,280
right now we're all the same

94
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,159
which is kind of hilarious sorry about

95
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,598
that

96
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,120
a little touchy but like now is a good

97
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,959
time to buy stuff in europe compared to

98
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,080
typically but then the rest of the

99
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,319
world one percent

100
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,959
one percent and here i started working

101
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,878
international in 2014 in canada then

102
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,799
denmark and that first crazy german

103
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,239
tender then winning like danish

104
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,760
companies and then portugal and like

105
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,200
south like

106
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,959
massive expansion one percent

107
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,399
so not to say like the rest of the world

108
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
doesn't matter because it does but

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
what's happening in the united states

110
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,519
similar to like

111
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,439
the honor that we have to give to the

112
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,120
netherlands for allowing their seed

113
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,199
breeder programs and really starting the

114
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,439
genetics that just went from like

115
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,958
cheese or skunk or whatever you know

116
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,158
typical things especially if there's uk

117
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,598
people here

118
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,878
they were like the first to allow

119
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,560
certain things

120
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,479
the united states is taking consumer

121
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,199
culture to a whole new level of like

122
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,959
products edibles beverages

123
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,560
international medical is all about

124
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,719
compassionate use which means it can

125
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
just be an api an active pharmaceutical

126
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,199
ingredient flour or bulk oil

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
all compounding has to happen in

128
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,798
pharmacies so it's not like i'm gonna

129
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,238
make vape cartridges in portugal and

130
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,560
sell them to german medical it's like

131
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,439
that doesn't work that way in the u.s it

132
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,358
does

133
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,839
but we've get we're really the guinea

134
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,519
pig market like what products work what

135
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,359
do consumers like what packaging

136
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,719
marketing and as we navigate in the

137
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
united states since it's federally

138
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,199
illegal each state's like its own little

139
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,120
country violating federal law

140
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
but using state laws to do it so the

141
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,439
things that the rest of the world can

142
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
learn

143
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,160
we know what people like i don't care if

144
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,639
you're european asian american south

145
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
african it doesn't matter were people

146
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
now there are certain cultures that have

147
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
different things where they might like

148
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,439
salty or they might like sweet different

149
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,919
taste profiles but at the end of the day

150
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,680
were people what delivery methods work

151
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,240
what types of like hashes have been

152
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,519
popular and what will a program allow

153
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,840
because some states in the u.s they

154
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,198
would only allow like smokeable flower

155
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,719
georgia five percent thc oil or less

156
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,478
you know so like each little place is

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,680
different you always have to adapt your

158
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,639
business plan

159
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
to what that place is going to do

160
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
now in the united states it's kind of

161
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
like i said each state's like its own

162
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
little country we only have a couple

163
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,478
little holdouts

164
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,320
but

165
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,159
and and again sorry for the last couple

166
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,639
years you know the america show like our

167
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
soap opera has been pretty dramatic

168
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,038
lots of like page turner's there and

169
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,199
sorry if we kind of look like

170
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,120
ridiculous in the past and uh

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,960
you know women can still vote at least

172
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
in america you know we got that going

173
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,359
for us um so even though it looks a

174
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
little crazy in what's happening when we

175
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,360
focus on the cannabis industry from like

176
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,279
colorado california some of these new

177
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
adult use states some of the ones that

178
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,599
are on the cusp of changing and when

179
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
each state does this and legalizes it's

180
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
a new market opportunity but i can't

181
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,520
grow cannabis at a legal operation in

182
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,478
california and sell it in a different

183
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,318
state

184
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,159
everything i produce in a country in the

185
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,840
state i have to sell in the state no

186
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
crossing state lines when that

187
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,638
changes we always have to think like

188
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,799
agricultural vectors like this is an

189
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,918
agricultural commodity and i'm a farm

190
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,918
kid like i love growing cannabis but i

191
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,758
love growing tomatoes in echinacea and

192
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,879
when we look at other agricultural

193
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
industries

194
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,000
what works for production methodologies

195
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,318
indoor is really popular right now

196
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
because we were illegal are illegal so

197
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
we went indoors to hide but what other

198
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,918
plants do we commercially produce on a

199
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,918
viable scale

200
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,879
in warehouses or in little growth

201
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,719
chambers with fancy led lights

202
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,240
greenhouses outdoor

203
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,000
our operations i have one operation in

204
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,759
columbia i could literally supply the

205
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
whole world with cannabis

206
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,960
from

207
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
but indoors

208
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,839
high cost of capital high cost of

209
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
construction high operational costs when

210
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,119
you do hydroponic or other things a

211
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,559
system failure it's like life support

212
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
and the plants die

213
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,839
but when you really think of like what

214
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,759
works and like where could i produce

215
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,000
cannabis where i have a better climate

216
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,360
temperature like cheaper land better

217
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,639
taxes

218
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,879
that's where cannabis is going to come

219
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,680
from long term so in the u.s pre-federal

220
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,360
legalization patchwork little framework

221
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,160
eventually where in the u.s is going to

222
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,080
be cheapest to mass produce and sell and

223
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,039
then after international legalization

224
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,159
happens

225
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,598
that's where the countries that are

226
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,439
closest to the equator will be the

227
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,519
winners like we're going to stop growing

228
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,199
pineapples in warehouses in germany to

229
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,120
have pineapples we'll bring them from

230
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,439
where it's cheap to produce but

231
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,879
currently that's not allowed

232
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,719
but the united states is definitely a

233
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,439
model we can learn from

234
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,960
so international medical cannabis

235
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,959
there's so much supply from some of

236
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,560
these lower cost of production nations

237
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,318
you know even like portugal great and

238
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,038
the european union but when you look at

239
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,598
south africa thailand potentially moving

240
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,279
forward colombia peru some of these

241
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,680
other countries the cost of production

242
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,799
there i can make a kilo of eug compliant

243
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,959
cannabis for less than 10 euros

244
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
and then here we're talking about

245
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,159
allowing it for 10 euros a gram and like

246
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
setting certain standards and you're

247
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,960
like hmm

248
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,279
there's going to be a massive disconnect

249
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,638
and then oversupply currently happening

250
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,038
internationally because without a

251
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,960
doctor's prescription in the us its

252
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,959
doctors recommendations because they

253
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,680
can't give a prescription for cannabis

254
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,519
unless it's epidiolex out of you know

255
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
marinol like other synthetic

256
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,120
cannabinoids so international without

257
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
doctors being educated about the

258
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
benefits of cannabis and being willing

259
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,598
to write a prescription patients don't

260
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,158
get it i mean germany didn't even do 350

261
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,679
million euros in sales last year

262
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,759
of medical and it's the largest medical

263
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,918
market in the united are in the eu and

264
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,439
in the world outside of the united

265
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,240
states

266
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,680
but when you think of 350 million euros

267
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
for all the medical patients that are

268
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,679
happening here colorado just to put in

269
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,879
perspective did close to 3 billion last

270
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,958
year

271
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,360
that's with 6 million people you got

272
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,958
close to 90 million people here so it's

273
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
just a matter of time but we have to do

274
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,639
doctor education we have to come up with

275
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,639
a federal and international medical

276
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,480
system before adult use

277
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,159
that's exactly what we did in the united

278
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
states in each and every state that went

279
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,639
from medical to adult use here's a

280
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,159
little stat for you 100 of the time in

281
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,559
the united states if you had a medical

282
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,480
license in a state you're first in line

283
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,599
for adult use

284
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
doesn't mean you're making a ton of

285
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
money sometimes in those medical days

286
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,120
but if you're willing to bleed and you

287
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
can hold that position

288
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,959
you will most likely be rewarded

289
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,320
internationally so there's three crappy

290
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,239
companies no offense to y'all if you're

291
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,640
here that have the production licenses

292
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,919
in germany

293
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,519
depending on how supply is going to

294
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,199
happen they might be first in line for

295
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
this so there's a time and a place when

296
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
holding a position can be great but if

297
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
you can't withstand the market pressures

298
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,360
it will crush you

299
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,800
like a bad short or a bad investment

300
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
now with international adult use

301
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,679
happening we've got a couple examples

302
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,278
spanish social clubs the netherlands we

303
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,559
have luxembourg with

304
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,799
what they had planned to do that then

305
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,799
couldn't happen and now germany

306
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,958
and germany really really unique in how

307
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,799
they're planning on doing adult use the

308
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,799
implementation is going to be the

309
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,240
problem because you have all of these

310
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,159
international organizations from the

311
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,039
international narcotics control board

312
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,958
the un with three treaties like the 1961

313
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,439
single convention treaty on psychotropic

314
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,759
substances kind of a mouthful and the 71

315
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,839
and the 1978 indies indian pharmacies

316
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,519
act there's all these different policies

317
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,000
that kind of go over this

318
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,560
so where is supply going to come from

319
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,919
like we don't know that because not only

320
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,278
in germany and how they decided to

321
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759
legalize

322
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,200
and are still working on

323
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,799
it's not just like the united states

324
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
doing their own thing or canada doing

325
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,000
their own thing or uruguay doing their

326
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,079
own thing you're members of the european

327
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,639
union and that's actually the biggest

328
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,000
problem if you violate un law yeah

329
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,519
what are they going to do sanctions this

330
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
isn't russia with ukraine right now it's

331
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,480
like oh canada legalized recreational

332
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,800
lake let's cut off swift to canada

333
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,720
like it didn't happen we were terrified

334
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,399
with uruguay uruguay was like colorado

335
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,000
in 2014.

336
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,039
they legalized adult use and were like

337
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
oh

338
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,759
and they're like a small little country

339
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
like crackdown nothing enter nothing

340
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,600
so

341
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,199
you know

342
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,879
the european union's really what could

343
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
crack down because there are a lot of

344
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,000
policies there so first

345
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,679
decriminalization is huge in how we

346
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,159
could do this

347
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,599
homegrown isn't as hard to regulate and

348
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,519
easier based on like what countries

349
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
would allow but the issue with home grow

350
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,519
just like home brewing

351
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,278
it's super intensive you have to like

352
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
wash all the bottles have the car boys

353
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,200
do all the labeling like how many people

354
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
do that and do it well and it's also can

355
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,320
be an environmental catastrophe it's

356
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,799
kind of bad for the industry but if

357
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,560
that's what it takes to legalize it it's

358
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,078
better i mean if you can grow your own

359
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,759
tobacco or brew your own beer why don't

360
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,278
we all do that

361
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
because we're convenient little

362
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,679
creatures and we like things easy like

363
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,278
if i can buy a six pack for five euros

364
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,199
ten euros why would i actually like go

365
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,879
to the trouble of brewing beer but

366
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,399
people do it and that craft stuff is

367
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,919
great but that's probably one of the

368
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,720
keys that we could get international

369
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,000
done

370
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,759
and you think about all these

371
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
organizations that kind of govern this

372
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,838
especially in the united states like the

373
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,399
dea with their very cute little logo

374
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,160
like kind of and then america

375
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440
we were the world police we're like

376
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,399
america

377
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,160
and

378
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,078
when we pretty much went after medical

379
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,879
cannabis and cannabis just to get rid of

380
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,199
hemp back in the 30s a few u.s white

381
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,600
men all dead thank god but their

382
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,800
policies exist

383
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,720
we caused this and i'm sorry like

384
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,399
it's one of those like neo-liberalism

385
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,480
like way too early and it's like oh

386
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
let's make hemp illegal but by doing it

387
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
thinking about how cannabis was so bad

388
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,919
you know jack herrera one of our heroes

389
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
in the space like his book the emperor

390
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,599
wears no clothes if you want to

391
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,000
understand how cannabis got illegal

392
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,839
look into that because it was never

393
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,078
about cannabis being dangerous for like

394
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
our health it was already a part of

395
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,239
different pharmaceutical kind of

396
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,560
regulations botanical compacts way early

397
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
in the 1850s and one of the reasons

398
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,078
cannabis isn't that sexy to

399
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,519
pharmaceutical companies is because

400
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,679
there's this thing called the safety

401
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,799
profile when you make a standardized

402
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,519
drug

403
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,838
if you make something new and you own it

404
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,320
and it passes that safety profile your

405
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,279
viagra for that industry for 20 plus

406
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,720
years

407
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,799
it passed that safety profile in the

408
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,759
1850s so there's nothing that sexy about

409
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,639
owning cannabis per se

410
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,720
but

411
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,799
when you think about this like whole

412
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,519
scheme of regulations from like u.n drug

413
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,679
law european union drug law how these

414
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,440
compacts work between countries

415
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,239
navigating this is terrifying as an

416
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
investor but if you do it well

417
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,200
you're going to be in a good position

418
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,278
now the international narcotics control

419
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,278
board not a fan of anything that's

420
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,639
happening but what the are they

421
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,000
doing about it

422
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,360
they're complaining

423
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,879
they're not enforcing they're not

424
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
cracking down

425
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,958
but would they especially in the

426
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,239
european union if supply starts

427
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,599
happening from

428
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
one of the key ways people are thinking

429
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
about doing this

430
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,560
using this as an example would be like

431
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,360
okay i'm producing eug

432
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,278
like gacp compliant and eug compliant

433
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,000
cannabis in let's say columbia

434
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,480
i sell it to a medical importer in

435
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,078
germany that medical distributor

436
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
accepts that product but now it's in a

437
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,599
country that's legal so now we can label

438
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,159
it adult use cannabis

439
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
not exactly at all but that's one of the

440
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,719
quickest and easiest ways that most

441
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
people think that this is going to

442
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,480
happen but we have to be very very

443
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,078
careful about these because they haven't

444
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,600
enforced yet but if they did

445
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,159
what it would cost to the industry could

446
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
be catastrophic but i don't think it's

447
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,679
going to happen if countries you know

448
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,039
prevent youth access do proper education

449
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,799
these are things like safety and

450
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,319
security not allowing like foreign

451
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,240
crimes

452
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,160
that are going to really allow this

453
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,600
european union is kind of huge and the

454
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,559
big thing i wanted to just mention here

455
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,120
it's like tobacco is estimated to be 263

456
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,078
billion euros in the eu

457
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,360
alcohol 467

458
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:51,198
of that about 37 beer

459
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,120
and about 40 wine and spirits and the

460
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,399
rest is kind of like a lot of these new

461
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,759
seltzers and different things that are

462
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,278
changing

463
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,000
but i love how they said that the

464
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,278
illicit cannabis market was 9 billion

465
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,198
last year

466
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,879
the dea used to say that the illegal

467
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,879
cannabis market in the united states was

468
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,799
50 billion dollars

469
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,720
it's closer to like 200 billion in the

470
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,278
united states and it's probably closer

471
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,720
to 300 billion here in europe but how do

472
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,759
they have good accurate reporting on

473
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,040
this based on crimes and costs

474
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,480
it's enormous and like smoking's cool

475
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,240
over here not a school in europe in

476
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,720
america but when we see some of these

477
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,240
changes happen like what opportunity

478
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
this will be like the second largest

479
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
market in the world the us we got a head

480
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,320
start on you you have more people though

481
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
and it's going to be a lot easier to

482
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,160
regulate this when you do it from an eu

483
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,639
standpoint then like state by state each

484
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,399
little state guessing how to do this but

485
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,919
learn from what we've done in the us to

486
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,839
do this

487
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,159
i mean you've had some major strides for

488
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,000
medical here in the eu but what has that

489
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,120
led to in terms of revenue

490
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,039
valuations growth propositions

491
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
it's been great for patients disabled

492
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,719
vet myself that's how i got into this

493
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
space we always have to focus on the

494
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,160
patients but we're all people we all

495
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,278
have these endocannabinoid systems so

496
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,240
who are going to be the ones that are

497
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,519
like the leaders in supplying this

498
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,639
big thing i always kind of say it's like

499
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,240
when you think about the world and

500
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,839
others have it's like where are these

501
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,680
key positions and where do they matter

502
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
you got one shot to put your pieces down

503
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,198
on the board unless you have a whole

504
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,040
ton of capital if so we should talk

505
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,799
don't go into this game alone

506
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,480
the due diligence is insane which i'll

507
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,078
get into knowing what's like a good

508
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
investment for people that have been

509
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,278
around for over a decade i've seen

510
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,239
thousands of like a similar business

511
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,159
plan

512
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
other times you might not have access to

513
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,679
like unique deal flow so you have to

514
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,959
know where and how to put that capital

515
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,958
but it's always knowing the rules to

516
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,638
play the game and each one's going to be

517
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,479
different just because you can do one

518
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,680
thing in jamaica or one thing in south

519
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,920
africa doesn't mean that you're going to

520
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,599
be able to do it everywhere

521
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,198
so it's not the same as traditional

522
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,159
business but it does follow a lot of the

523
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,198
same

524
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:53,278
kind of histories so why is cannabis

525
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,679
like super sexy for investing now we're

526
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,360
the largest growing emerging industry in

527
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,198
the history of the world

528
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
fastest and largest

529
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,519
bigger than dot coms because coms didn't

530
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,199
have the internet to like boost their

531
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,838
company or influencers to get people to

532
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,519
buy products back then

533
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,599
huge how long did it take the alcohol

534
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,759
industry to evolve how long did it take

535
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,558
the tobacco industry to evolve we got 20

536
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,078
years max on this and where are that

537
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,599
timeline has started so if you want to

538
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,159
be jamison you want to be philip you

539
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,078
want to be british american tobacco

540
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,439
now is the frickin time and you don't

541
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,558
want to start little startup companies

542
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,000
for 500k here 500 euros there it's all

543
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,519
about like mergers and acquisitions and

544
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,759
we've seen copious amounts of that in

545
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,839
the united states but now is the time

546
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,599
that when companies are bleeding

547
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,519
they used to think i'm worth 100 million

548
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,519
you're actually probably worth 20. so

549
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,558
like you can get more for your buck

550
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,720
right now

551
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,918
than you could ever before

552
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,038
when it comes to some of the public

553
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,640
companies

554
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,359
they're lowest lower than we've ever

555
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,600
seen and granted public market investing

556
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,359
is crazy like the public versus private

557
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,359
trying to choose which ones but if

558
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,639
there's ever been a time like it's like

559
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,798
that thing with a tree like the best

560
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,440
time to plant a tree 20 years ago the

561
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,798
next best time is today

562
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,640
private capital we don't have

563
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,319
institutional capital that can flow into

564
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,160
this because they're too

565
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,000
risk-adverse to like being the first in

566
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
the water that's why a lot of giant

567
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
banks and social institutions they're

568
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,359
not into this yet it's why private

569
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
offices family family offices

570
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,038
multi-family offices

571
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,719
so so vital for the growth of this

572
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,640
industry

573
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,480
a lot of companies are struggling though

574
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,360
because like in the united states we

575
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,679
have a weird tax code called irc 280e we

576
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,599
can't deduct our business costs so let's

577
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,320
say i do 10 million in revenue 5 million

578
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,798
in cost i should pay taxes on 5 million

579
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,480
sometimes i'll pay taxes on 7 to 9

580
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,558
million even

581
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,960
if i only you know had 5 million in

582
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,200
costs it's absolutely ridiculous

583
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
they can't scale as quickly as possible

584
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
they over projected their markets

585
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
thinking like oh i'm going to get this

586
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,839
colombian production license and i'll

587
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,519
supply the whole world so i'll put 70

588
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,639
million euros into this thing and it's

589
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,798
like well

590
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,759
how can it be scalable and how can a

591
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,918
business grow as market demand grows

592
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,839
but the supply chain issues that happen

593
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,480
during coronavirus i mean the cost of

594
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,798
steel for me the cost of glass i used to

595
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,319
be a big fan of like new buildings but

596
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,720
now being able to retrofit things and

597
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,399
get to market faster

598
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,558
the same thing that i used to be able to

599
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
build three years ago is about three

600
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,558
times more money to build the exact same

601
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,480
thing today and takes about twice as

602
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,798
long which is you're like oh it's

603
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,519
only three years what changed

604
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,359
coronavirus supply chains employment

605
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,639
side and now as we're starting to

606
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,479
rebuild

607
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
everything is in such high demand that

608
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,558
suppliers actually can't even keep up

609
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,399
because they're all startups too like

610
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,879
every single company that's growing and

611
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,798
like all of that original revenue like

612
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,039
35 billion last year

613
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,960
almost 200 billion in ancillary services

614
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,119
for real estate construction legal

615
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,679
consulting investment due diligence

616
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,599
everyone's backed up right now

617
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,280
so the due diligence that most investors

618
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,879
miss on a normal project like is this a

619
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,119
unique market vantage like what's the

620
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,520
true valuation of this company like

621
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,119
due diligence is a whole new level now

622
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,798
one thing that i can say to investors is

623
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,678
take that word cannabis out of the deal

624
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,918
flow equation is this a viable business

625
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,720
not just because it's a sexy new thing

626
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,559
can it function independently of being

627
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,159
cannabis and like oh it's a cbd company

628
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,079
and like i've seen that in gas stations

629
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,679
i should invest into that not a good

630
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,720
idea don't buy those products at gas

631
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,080
stations

632
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,000
but when it comes to like the products

633
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,279
did they protect their ip

634
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,038
what's that team do they have the

635
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,359
ability to actually execute on this is

636
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,279
it a diverse team in the united states

637
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,439
we have the worst social justice problem

638
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,678
in cannabis in the history of ever i

639
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
mean cannabis was made illegal by saying

640
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,840
like

641
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,679
hispanics and african-americans were

642
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,519
going to like rape white women and

643
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,880
reefer madness and insanity and then

644
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,558
meanwhile

645
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,159
almost 90 percent of cannabis arrests

646
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,759
historically in the us are not white

647
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,760
people but we use cannabis the same

648
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,079
across the board so now there's big

649
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,679
social equity programs which are huge in

650
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,439
the u.s for like getting licenses and

651
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,400
jurisdictions if you had a past cannabis

652
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,120
crime

653
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,600
i had a company worth

654
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,479
247 billion in a cash acquisition

655
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,439
that

656
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,798
now

657
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,558
the only way you can get those sorts of

658
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,879
companies is is if somebody or one of

659
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,720
the original owners had a drug crime but

660
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,640
i've also lost a company because someone

661
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,880
had a joint 13 years ago and didn't

662
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,200
disclose it and lost a license in one of

663
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,559
the most competitive markets in the u.s

664
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,038
so we've got this shifting kind of

665
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,319
policy but in the eu when we pulled

666
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,798
people like what was most important

667
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,639
social equity is so low of like helping

668
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,879
to like get people out of jail for like

669
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
non-violent cannabis arrests having

670
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,039
diversity parameters not just like rich

671
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
white guy companies but like females

672
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,640
minorities like diversity is our

673
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,319
strength in this industry

674
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
and if you're not having companies like

675
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,399
that have diverse boards and others

676
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,480
investment's not going to flow easy

677
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,880
either but the nice thing now is that

678
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,440
esg like environmental socially governed

679
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,200
companies it's sexy like some funds have

680
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,558
certain mandates just to invest into

681
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
companies that have environmental and

682
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,319
social mandates and even our fund we

683
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,480
won't invest into companies unless they

684
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,079
have a diverse board so really think

685
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,839
about how to diversify not just to look

686
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,439
good and get investment because it's the

687
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,359
right thing to do

688
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,840
i mean realistically like this is a new

689
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,000
industry we can create it how we want

690
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,319
and we don't have to follow the same

691
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,440
past framework any depending on where

692
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,399
your capital is coming from like

693
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,080
diversifying capital diversifies risk a

694
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
diversified team

695
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,879
i'm a biologist diversity is totally our

696
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,319
strength in these businesses

697
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
a lot of them are failing though because

698
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,200
remember

699
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,439
this is a startup industry full of

700
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,798
startup companies

701
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,240
sometimes i'm like i've been around

702
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,918
doing this for a decade and a half and

703
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,839
i'm like man did we pass startup phase

704
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,919
yet or not but we're always thinking

705
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,240
like lean and agile i cleaned a toilet

706
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,080
last week in an office it was dirty it's

707
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,839
like sometimes you have to do everything

708
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,519
when you're in these businesses

709
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,918
but like no company is perfect and

710
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,759
they're always growing

711
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
the dot-com bubble was enormous the

712
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,158
cannabis bubble is even worse because

713
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,759
it's so sexy and like good but there's

714
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
not enough due diligence in history and

715
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,000
track record but there are for some of

716
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,519
us that have been around this long

717
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,119
so when you think about like public

718
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,599
versus private you know i always make

719
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,599
fun of tillery and always will um

720
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,959
just change my mind it's going to be

721
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,678
hard

722
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,000
but it's hard to raise money like

723
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,600
it's really hard to raise capital if i

724
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,480
go public and talk about all this cool

725
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,240
stuff

726
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
money can just flow because different

727
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,519
investors can do that like they can get

728
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,759
in and they can get out but private

729
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:30,319
capital on average has had a 27x

730
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,319
return versus public

731
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,279
even in the times

732
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,200
when

733
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,519
no laser but like that bottom trough

734
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
there that was rona like remember like

735
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,918
march 17th like we're on pjs and

736
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,359
that's when i was awake for four days

737
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,960
wearing a t-rex

738
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,199
shirt and like watching the canadian

739
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,038
public companies just tank and just

740
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,360
buying them like there was literally no

741
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,278
tomorrow like investing my parents like

742
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,558
retirement funds i'm like oh this is so

743
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,319
i'm like this is risky but i'm like i

744
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,558
think i know what i'm doing

745
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,319
um we made massive crushes especially

746
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,119
before biden got elected and this looked

747
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,439
good

748
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,918
we actually are lower today as a public

749
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,320
stock index than we were during the

750
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,159
crash of 2020

751
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,200
which is crazy and in the u.s like our

752
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,120
companies like

753
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,038
non-cannabis companies but most canadian

754
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,399
companies on average listed

755
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:21,440
over 40 down year to date even if you

756
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,038
were to take a million euros and put

757
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,679
a hundred thousand euros into like the

758
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,599
10 msos in the u.s

759
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,200
to set it and forget it like now is the

760
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,918
time even if you're diversifying the

761
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,440
public but diversifying into privates

762
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,600
that are going to be acquired by these

763
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,320
giants once they get back on their feet

764
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,480
those are those 27 axe exits it's not

765
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,000
about like being philip morris sometimes

766
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,839
it's about being bought by them or who's

767
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
going to be bought by them first and

768
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,879
that's what we really try to

769
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,080
strategically outline

770
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,760
so what do you got to do to beat some of

771
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,960
these odds let's just check on this

772
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,558
rambling

773
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,840
okay we've got a couple more

774
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,879
what do you got to do to beat the odds

775
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,199
now

776
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,720
as an investor or a company you have to

777
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,880
be unique

778
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,600
everyone does this now like it's not

779
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,039
this isn't 2014. you can't just list and

780
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,359
think you're going to be canopy or

781
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,480
aurora or build the a giant greenhouse

782
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,399
in the tundra and think you're going to

783
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,079
supply the world with cannabis

784
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,640
i thought like it was a good idea sorry

785
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,319
aurora didn't work out very well

786
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,559
financial models

787
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,399
like i don't spend time with like sexy

788
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,000
models i spend time i fall asleep with

789
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,919
financial models

790
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,440
like if i can't see it and understand it

791
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,120
through an excel sheet it doesn't make

792
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,640
sense to me if you have a two-page

793
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,678
financial model i'm probably not going

794
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,200
to read it

795
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,640
where are your assumptions coming from

796
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,159
are they vetted have you thought about

797
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
waste disposal have you thought about

798
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,840
taxes have you thought about every

799
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,839
aspect of pre-construction building

800
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,079
entitlements sewer permits

801
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,399
three-phase power upgrades regulatory

802
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,399
regime things testing costs

803
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,080
is your price 4000 a kilo for the next

804
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,278
five years if so i'm not turning to the

805
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,720
next page

806
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,000
sensitivity

807
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,038
so if you don't know how to model your

808
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,880
companies and you're trying to raise

809
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,640
capital start on that now if you're an

810
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
investor get some help with like

811
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,159
reviewing these financial models even

812
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
some independent due diligence

813
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,039
confidentially just to review their

814
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,038
models and be like

815
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,079
do some stress tests on those what

816
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,400
happens

817
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,000
i didn't see the ukraine thing happening

818
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,360
at all i thought it was just like putin

819
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,038
flexing and then all of a sudden like

820
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,158
our ukrainian hemp companies are all

821
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,240
like oh

822
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,480
that's okay war we didn't think about

823
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,079
that what other things could happen now

824
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,240
it's 8 billion people it's a volatile

825
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,839
world prices are going up they're never

826
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,000
going to come down it's not going to

827
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,918
find more natural gas somewhere and like

828
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,839
solve all of our problems like hit peak

829
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,840
oil in the 70s goods are going to keep

830
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,599
getting more and more expensive

831
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,839
we're going to have more and more issues

832
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,599
old industries are turning to dinosaurs

833
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,278
but you have to have robust good

834
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,879
financial models

835
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,480
real estate if i knew what i knew now

836
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,159
i'd be a billionaire from cannabis real

837
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,720
estate back in the day

838
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,559
in the u.s each little city or places

839
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
you can't typically apply for a license

840
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,079
without compliant real estate with an

841
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,759
owner that says it's fine to do this

842
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,960
less than one percent of real estate is

843
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,278
actually compliant for cannabis

844
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,720
typically production manufacturing

845
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,798
retail

846
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,480
are they going to sign up not all cities

847
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,480
say yes so you can't just think every

848
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,880
little place is going to be good

849
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,960
but real estate will be and has been so

850
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,559
vital it was for our dutch licenses for

851
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,159
the danish licenses for the portuguese

852
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,918
licenses for the german ones back in

853
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,080
2015

854
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,360
real estate if you're in cannabis you're

855
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,879
going to have to have real estate if

856
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,678
you're in real estate

857
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,278
why

858
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,360
be working and doing investments that

859
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,278
you're getting six percent on like i

860
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,599
can't guarantee it but i'd get you 18 on

861
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,880
canvas real estate all day every day and

862
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,959
it's a problem because you got the uk

863
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,760
foreign you know crimes act that i can't

864
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,278
take tons of money out of the uk even

865
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,519
investing into real estate in the united

866
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,880
states just being leased to a cannabis

867
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,480
company

868
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
so like being able to like get good

869
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,880
capital real estate especially for debt

870
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:47,038
is important these opportunity zones so

871
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,559
massive internationally as well like in

872
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,398
the us if i put a business in an

873
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,558
opportunity zone and i spend 25 million

874
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,879
euros building that thing out if it's

875
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,480
opportunity zone the investors don't

876
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,399
have to pay capital gains taxes on where

877
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,599
the money came from if it sits there for

878
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,599
five to seven years depending on the

879
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,678
jurisdiction they don't have to pay

880
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,199
capital gains on that investment

881
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,120
if you can tell that story to your

882
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,679
investors and save them taxes on past

883
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,879
gains and future gains of you i don't

884
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,960
care if you're like raising baby

885
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
elephants or whatever it might be

886
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,319
like tell the story to your investors

887
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,600
and make it lucrative not just for what

888
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,038
you think is good but what's going to be

889
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,480
good for them

890
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,240
you know there's all these pitfalls you

891
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,319
can plan so much there can be all these

892
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,839
business plans the world changed so

893
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,000
quickly though that in trying to adapt

894
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,240
with that now and having robust supply

895
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
chains what if this vendor fails how am

896
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,919
i going to scale not building out too

897
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,480
big and taking over the world

898
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,080
bite by bite by bite and even if you

899
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,240
like like dude surfing even if you do

900
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,678
the best thing ever there's random ass

901
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,038
little jet skis that are just gonna hit

902
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,200
you out of the blue

903
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,720
how do you deal with that like are you

904
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,319
like if you were sponsoring surfers i

905
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
wouldn't want to sponsor one i'd sponsor

906
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,759
six of them what if one of them get

907
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,759
eaten by a shark what you know you have

908
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,319
to have diversity in your planning

909
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,000
and now is the time like that sense of

910
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,000
urgency to get either get into this

911
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,079
industry because otherwise if you wait a

912
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,359
few years yeah a little less risky we'll

913
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,558
know what's going to happen in germany

914
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,158
we know it's going to happen in other

915
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,158
places

916
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
but now is literally the time where if

917
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,919
you can diversify into this sector it's

918
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,240
the only thing worth doing be it in your

919
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,080
country your jurisdiction if you supply

920
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,480
even packaging or something like how do

921
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,639
you get into this industry if alcohol is

922
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,480
close to half a trillion dollars every

923
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,278
year in the eu

924
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,960
tobacco over a quarter trillion

925
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,319
i mean cannabis is easily here going to

926
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,278
be a quarter trillion to a half a

927
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,278
billion trillion if not more once this

928
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,159
is established but you only get a new

929
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,000
industry like this once dot com happened

930
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,360
industrial revolution happened cannabis

931
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,398
is happening

932
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,678
i don't think jack shit's going to

933
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,839
happen in the rest of our lifetimes

934
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,080
based on like our ages here i mean with

935
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,199
sustainable energies when oil is still

936
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,038
around they're going to lobby against

937
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,440
that that's good but not

938
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,519
cannabis and we are recession proof even

939
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
though the stocks are looking crazy even

940
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,240
though some sales are a little bit down

941
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,480
right now

942
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,000
i mean vice industries like it's a hard

943
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,440
world right now cannabis is just going

944
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
to help that so

945
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,399
greatly appreciate the opportunity to

946
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,399
share some of these insights with you

947
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,079
today and remember like

948
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,079
we've been around it's not like a new

949
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,720
industry are people going to use the

950
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,240
internet or buy things on the internet

951
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,679
they've been doing this for

952
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,919
we've been using this for like millions

953
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,360
of years as a species we need industrial

954
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,159
hemp to come back not just novel

955
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,639
cannabinoids like delta aid or cbd like

956
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,640
rope textiles plastics and that sector

957
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,320
amazing as well but lacking billions of

958
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,880
infrastructure but that's going to

959
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,918
replace so much with cotton and textiles

960
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
and other

961
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,840
petroleum-based industries like this is

962
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,519
like the one time that making good

963
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,199
investments makes the world better and

964
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,720
awesome returns if you do it

965
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,640
right so really appreciate the

966
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,960
opportunity everyone thank you
