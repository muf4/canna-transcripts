Nick Easley guten morgen we gates tear

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,978
it gets good so I was hoping they'd have

22
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,019
a little something stronger up here for

23
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,478
me this morning really appreciate

24
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,560
everyone's time to come from the United

25
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,060
States to come and share some of this

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
information it's kind of a kind of

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,950
paramount the European Union has so many

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,840
opportunities right now that are barely

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,990
beginning and with half a billion person

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,270
population without a legitimate bona

31
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:29,789
fide program yet you have so much room

32
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:31,859
to grow thank you I just uh just

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,359
prepared this this morning yesterday was

34
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,429
really impressive I was going through

35
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,030
cards last night I talked to people from

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,650
17 countries last night like a normal

37
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,810
conference it's like oh this state this

38
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,490
is going on but to see how many people

39
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,540
have come together for this industry is

40
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:48,959
really really impressive

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,960
so hopefully this works out that's me

42
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,169
Niki's I'm originally a farm kid from

43
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,399
Wisconsin was in FFA and did agriculture

44
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,349
right out of the high school essentially

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
the military recruited me to be a

46
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,489
linguist so I speak a few languages

47
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,500
unfortunately not German

48
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,328
Spanish a few indigenous languages and

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,449
was in the service for about four years

50
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:11,099
and got hurt and was 22 didn't really

51
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,799
know what to do I had a biology degree

52
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,930
and flipped a coin and decided to go to

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,860
Colorado for a ski season that was right

54
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,590
after medical

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,410
started and Colorado s you know is kind

56
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,969
of like the Amsterdam of the United

57
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,469
States and actually kind of the world

58
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,419
because even Amsterdam's original

59
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,330
program was nothing like what happened

60
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:33,780
in Colorado so over the years from going

61
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,310
from you know farming the Midwest to

62
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,560
military to Colorado right at that

63
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,659
perfect moment I've been able to see how

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,759
the industry has really grown so from

65
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,109
small medical producers that could grow

66
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,120
their own cannabis where there were no

67
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,070
dispensaries no commercial cultivation

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,590
and then Colorado we were the first

69
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,019
state that ever really had to grow up as

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,479
an industry and licenses for cultivation

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,250
and manufacturing and distribution and

72
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,819
then you had to have a grow license in

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,280
order to have a dispensary and then 2016

74
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,560
or 2012 happened in Colorado where

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,020
essentially proposition 64 was regulate

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,140
marijuana like alcohol and we were the

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,200
first state to legalize I don't like the

78
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,059
word but recreational marijuana adult

79
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,369
use responsible use marijuana and we did

80
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,680
it by regulating like like alcohol

81
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,640
last year in Colorado we did one point

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,709
six billion dollars in sales and that's

83
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,719
just direct cannabis sales that wasn't

84
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,719
all the ancillary products and services

85
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,769
surrounding that since that time we now

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:37,530
have Alaska Washington Oregon California

87
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:40,019
Nevada Colorado and soon to be

88
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,180
Massachusetts states that anyone who's

89
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,799
21 or older can go and buy cannabis

90
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,530
flower vaporizers suppositories infused

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,469
adult lubricant products edibles you

92
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,719
name it so when you think about that

93
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,400
potentiality coming from medical and

94
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,469
even knowing this is a very very sacred

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,879
medicinal plant and there is the

96
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,729
business component with this we're

97
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,259
seeing time and time again so many

98
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,879
companies that are starting and have

99
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:07,919
these visions of making all this money

100
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,650
in helping the patients but they don't

101
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,000
have business acumen and they don't put

102
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,010
together their companies correctly or

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,479
they don't understand taxes they don't

104
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,459
understand regulations they might know

105
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,988
how to grow the plant or make a really

106
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,180
good hash or how to have a good

107
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,728
dispensary for retail but they don't

108
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,348
know business and never having worked

109
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,389
now with almost 200 different clients

110
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,620
around the world we've seen time and

111
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,069
time again what are the tell-tale signs

112
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,899
of a good company or

113
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,629
bad company so just just to kind of

114
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:37,509
mention here I'm not a lawyer I'm not a

115
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,639
CPA I'm a biologist a farmer and

116
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:42,009
actually now a venture fund manager I

117
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,479
manage three venture funds as well so

118
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,849
I'm not giving legal advice

119
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm not giving tax advice this is purely

120
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,050
business guidance here to help your

121
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,960
businesses be it here internationally or

122
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,430
in the States to start to grow it's

123
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,899
really hard because we always consider

124
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,750
there's like the US market and then

125
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:00,459
everyone else but I for years been

126
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,889
considering this to be a global Empire

127
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:04,359
that we're building and even in the

128
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:07,180
United States you have to think about

129
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,819
each state as an individual country I

130
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,709
can't grow tomatoes in Oregon and bring

131
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,420
them to Washington even though they're

132
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:16,449
legal in Oregon and they're legal in

133
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,129
Washington I can't cross that line here

134
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,920
like having health care cover cannabis

135
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,899
you know having like the first federal

136
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,480
legal program of Canada where they're

137
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:26,799
going to have adult use this summer

138
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,550
incredible but then when people got all

139
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,560
excited were gonna have all these

140
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,180
dispensaries around Canada no one

141
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,310
remembered this little thing called the

142
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,290
LCBO it's the largest liquor store in

143
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,480
the world and it's owned by the Canadian

144
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,819
government and the Canadian government

145
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,980
really they made some interesting

146
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,540
policies to where most of the provinces

147
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,460
they're going to be running the cannabis

148
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,900
dispensaries so a lot of Canadian

149
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,370
companies in LPs thought hey we're going

150
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:49,689
to do all these dispensaries but then a

151
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,329
lot of the places they wanted to they

152
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:53,139
cannot so those rules and regulations

153
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:55,120
are some of the things that we're gonna

154
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,759
mention here today

155
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,189
also since I do raise copious amounts of

156
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,539
capital I just have to this is not

157
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:02,829
general solicitation I'm not in the

158
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,610
United States so I don't actually have

159
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,680
to say this

160
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,600
we're always raising money but this is

161
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,030
not like I'm not offering securities

162
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,800
here but if you send me an email and we

163
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,649
talk for about 30 days then we can

164
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,439
definitely offer securities like I said

165
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:18,909
in this industry my only problem from

166
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,920
going from years ago of like do I have

167
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,230
enough rain water for my tomato crops or

168
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,890
do I have enough like alfalfa for my

169
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,150
goats now it's like do I have enough

170
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,589
millions and millions and millions of

171
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,479
dollars to invest into the right

172
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,829
companies that are scaling taking market

173
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,170
share that are gonna have significant

174
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,819
exits and returns the worst thing in my

175
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,980
life is when I see great portfolio

176
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:40,779
companies and cannot raise quickly

177
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,300
enough to satiate those requirements and

178
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,779
there are great companies out there in

179
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,670
the you know

180
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,409
States and internationally and there's

181
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,870
the ability for international investors

182
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,610
to invest into the United States and the

183
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,918
United States investors to also invest

184
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,910
globally not just through the Canadian

185
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,299
public market which we're going to

186
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,510
discuss so you know this is I I always

187
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,280
want to start with like what not to do

188
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,039
this industry has countless examples of

189
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,559
what not to do not paying your taxes not

190
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,480
following safety standards using really

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,149
bad pesticides and having recalls and

192
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,600
violations over and over and over again

193
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:17,529
I mean our industry came from the gutter

194
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,890
literally like we were in an illicit

195
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:22,509
market and people god bless them the

196
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,279
caregivers who would cultivate this

197
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,800
plant illegally and get it to patients

198
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,869
who needed it for profit or not but like

199
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
those people they care took this plant

200
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,680
and brought it forward for us to be able

201
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,529
to use for business now but now it's the

202
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,360
purpose of using business to make this

203
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:41,589
plant better more affordable more

204
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,080
sustainably produced safer and to create

205
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:45,879
sustainable jobs in tax revenue where

206
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,189
you think of essentially the cannabis

207
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,290
industry what we've seen in the United

208
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:52,379
States in those six adult use markets so

209
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,689
far is that alcohol sales have gone down

210
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,430
13.7 percent and it's like well as

211
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:59,019
marijuana better than alcohol it's like

212
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,639
well a lot of people have fixed incomes

213
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,469
and like only so much money for fun

214
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,839
money a month so if you have like let's

215
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,850
say make two thousand euros a month and

216
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,009
you have five hundred extra euros a

217
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,140
month for like fun for beer for parties

218
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,418
well once cannabis is legal and you can

219
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,849
buy joints and you can buy vaporizers

220
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:17,680
your limited amount of capital you're

221
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,860
gonna be buying less alcohol that we've

222
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,650
seen also like opiate use like one of

223
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,240
the worst like more people died like in

224
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:27,399
the united states of opiate deaths than

225
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,460
like all of Vietnam casualties combined

226
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,959
annually so like opiates like

227
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,819
pharmaceutical narcotics like very very

228
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,158
addictive in some states in order to

229
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,780
actually have like medicinal cannabis

230
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,059
like you can't have opiates in your

231
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,759
system or vice versa if you actually

232
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,049
have cannabis in your system like you

233
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,059
can't actually get your pain medication

234
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,009
so they're almost forcing people to use

235
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,779
these opiates I mean it's an endemic

236
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,519
that no one really talks about but we're

237
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,338
seeing that opiate deaths are going down

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,199
almost 10% in states that have legal

239
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,710
amount

240
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,650
programs and that's 31 states last time

241
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,810
I counted I think the United States has

242
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:05,220
50 states

243
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:08,879
you know plus/minus but yeah like 50

244
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,830
states 31 is over 25

245
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,529
so that means half of the states at

246
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,509
least have a medical marijuana program 6

247
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,929
have adult use 7 with Massachusetts

248
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:21,480
coming and then 8 with Maine coming

249
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,829
Washington DC is also legal like legal

250
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,269
for adult use but since there's this

251
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,770
little thing called the Harris amendment

252
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,480
in the United States capitols right

253
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,100
there they wouldn't pay for like the

254
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,230
roads and schools essentially if they

255
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,430
opened up adult use stores this year

256
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,750
there's gonna be three more states on

257
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:36,899
ballot initiatives that are going to

258
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,720
have adult use cannabis soon to be 20%

259
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,789
of the United States 21 or older you can

260
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,259
buy cannabis I own companies and in

261
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:48,209
parts of companies that we now in like

262
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:50,549
Las Vegas have 24 7 dispensaries like I

263
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,580
was at one at 3:17 in the morning and

264
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:56,250
there were still like 25 people waiting

265
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,870
to get in so cannabis is an amazing

266
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,490
plant but if you don't do the business

267
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,889
right you don't have the right capital

268
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,820
you cannot scale and grow and that's

269
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:04,649
really one of the things I'm going to

270
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,750
mention here where you can see like down

271
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,519
the line it's an investor like what what

272
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,139
are market sectors doing what are the

273
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,179
companies that are scaling which ones

274
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,860
are really taking market position where

275
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,659
is a new market and based on their

276
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,000
population density disposable income

277
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:19,980
like locations or for a medical

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,139
marijuana program very very important

279
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,940
you must know what the qualifying

280
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,269
conditions are in a medical marijuana

281
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,270
state or country so for an example if

282
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:32,189
they don't have pain or PTSD as

283
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,110
qualifying conditions in the United

284
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,240
States that's almost 92 percent of all

285
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,769
medical cards that we've seen so that

286
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,159
means if a state only allows like

287
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:43,019
glaucoma a mask cancer aids like I'm

288
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,379
gonna have 8 percent of the potential

289
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,240
clients and clients well patients but

290
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,070
then my patients are my clients my

291
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,810
clients are my revenue my revenue is my

292
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,850
business and my business serves patients

293
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:55,679
and clients so if I can only have 8

294
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,960
percent of that or in some states like

295
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,609
0.2 percent of that population like in

296
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,190
Minnesota only a few conditions

297
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,870
New York Florida it's not going to be a

298
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,390
robust market and it's an investor I

299
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,250
found I cannot invest into medical

300
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,779
marijuana program

301
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,759
unless I have enough qualifying

302
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:13,220
conditions that'll support the business

303
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,139
unless I know long-term the legislations

304
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,759
going to change but what I've also found

305
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:18,289
for all of you in this room if you're in

306
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,450
this business you're an advocate you're

307
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:22,339
not just in business this isn't just an

308
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,550
opportunity you have a massive

309
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,170
responsibility like for this plant for

310
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:29,509
the plant that like past generations

311
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:32,089
like brought forward for us for tens of

312
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:34,490
thousands of years breeding like hemp

313
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,920
humph like that's like the the Great

314
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,389
Dane of the dog world and then like

315
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,009
poodles you know like little itty-bitty

316
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,330
dogs that's like the cannabis we bred

317
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,689
them for certain reasons just like

318
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,400
apples or tomatoes like what would

319
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,250
happen if you took a bulldog and a shih

320
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,189
tzu and like made a baby get some

321
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,779
right and that's where like if

322
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,280
you took a hemp plant and like a really

323
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,230
good cannabis plant that this one's way

324
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,279
low THC this one's way high THC you're

325
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,649
gonna get something in the middle and

326
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,449
then it's no longer legally hemp and the

327
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:05,110
diversification of the genetics pool

328
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:07,700
like Gregor Mendel stuff like back here

329
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,019
the genetics are so important like if

330
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,150
you want to have a kid who's Michael

331
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,069
Jordan but they're like four feet tall

332
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,838
you can buy him the best shoes you can

333
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,860
put them in the best basketball camps

334
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,990
but they're never gonna be Michael

335
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,639
Jordan you make the best business you

336
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,799
have the best team the best market but

337
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,199
you have bad genetics equally they're

338
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,639
not going to be Michael Jordan so I've

339
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,720
really like to look at like what of

340
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,799
other companies done they've been

341
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,810
failures and it's an investor maybe 20%

342
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,429
of the time I'm interested in past

343
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:36,229
companies because past companies in the

344
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:38,120
US probably didn't structure correctly

345
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,920
have all these past liabilities when you

346
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,070
buy a company you buy all the baggage

347
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,229
like the assets all the past problems

348
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,540
all the past lawsuits those then come

349
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,580
and transfer to you so something we're

350
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,319
gonna mention that's so important like

351
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,780
from the adult world is called like I

352
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,510
call it DD but like due diligence and

353
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:59,629
how do you do diligence on a market that

354
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,639
barely has any data like I own one of

355
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:02,689
the data companies based out of the

356
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,000
United States it's like Platts

357
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,410
mcgraw-hill what's the price of corn

358
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,940
today what's it gonna be tomorrow how

359
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:10,009
much does it cost to grill corn what's

360
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,360
the cost is gonna be and like what we've

361
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:13,309
seen with cannabis in these states that

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,620
allow multiple licenses not just like

363
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,419
Germany's original 10 or Arkansas's 5

364
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,820
when you can have Oregon Washington

365
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,789
California Colorado Michigan these

366
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,680
states that have

367
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:25,169
five hundred a thousand cultivation

368
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,419
licenses there's lots of competition and

369
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:29,009
competition is good in business but also

370
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,990
competition if you're on the down side

371
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,539
of it it will crush you and if it's

372
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,919
costing you $800 a pound to produce

373
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,319
indoors and like a ten thousand square

374
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,179
foot facility and I have a four acre

375
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,400
greenhouse producing cannabis for less

376
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,959
than $100 a pound all in compliantly

377
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,179
that's higher-quality

378
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,379
we can't call it organic in the United

379
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,029
States because that's a federal term

380
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,730
that's federally illegal so we have to

381
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,139
be a little careful there and it's this

382
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,670
moment that when you have the

383
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,769
opportunity to come in and make a new

384
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:58,799
company and do everything right good

385
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,899
lawyers good consulting good capital

386
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,250
like you have a strong shot there but

387
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:06,629
you have to insulate yourself from that

388
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,850
downside so not sure if you guys are

389
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:11,580
going to know this one but if you do you

390
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,639
can call it out anyone familiar with

391
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,980
lake kenny loggins like Top Gun highway

392
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,629
to the dangerzone it's kind of like my

393
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,269
analogy for this industry it's like this

394
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:22,889
is a danger zone and there are

395
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,960
patients suffering and there are

396
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,399
horrible things happening and a lot of

397
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,840
the products that people are buying and

398
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,209
selling like are very very dangerous

399
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,920
it's not the cannabis that's dangerous

400
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,280
it's the pesticides they're spraying on

401
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,259
it it's the 22 pounds of coal per gram

402
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,169
of cannabis indoors that it takes of

403
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,850
electricity to produce one gram like

404
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:43,589
every single light a thousand watt light

405
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,330
bulb if it takes you know the US

406
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,879
Department of Energy says about 2.2

407
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,190
pounds of coal per hour to make one

408
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,870
kilowatt of electricity so every

409
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,330
thousand watt light five feet by five

410
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,710
feet is 2 pounds of coal an hour 12

411
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,090
hours a day for the photo period you're

412
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,700
like wow that's like almost 30 pounds of

413
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,040
coal a day for one light for like one

414
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,259
plant for plants 12 plants depending on

415
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,389
how big they are and the environmental

416
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,340
part is so huge on this but from a

417
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,080
business standpoint that's huge capital

418
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,450
expenditures your operational

419
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,100
expenditures are higher so something

420
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,570
that's really unique about this industry

421
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,909
that this is the first time in the

422
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,800
history of business that doing the right

423
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:22,199
thing like environmentally producing in

424
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,909
greenhouses when you can not just doing

425
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,770
hydroponic with salt based derivatives

426
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:27,990
or bad pesticides because you designed

427
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,759
your growing properly like you actually

428
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,860
make more money like when you pay your

429
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,278
workers well you design your facilities

430
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,438
well you invest in you take the capital

431
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,448
you need so this danger zone like in the

432
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:42,259
United States it's federally illegal

433
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:43,639
like what I do is federally illegal but

434
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:45,889
state-by-state like we have this thing

435
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,600
called states rights each state can kind

436
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:49,009
of make their own laws and a lot of the

437
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,899
the states in the United States have

438
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:53,659
gone like this to the federal government

439
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,850
and for patients initially every single

440
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:59,058
marketplace in the United States started

441
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,069
as medical and then the six have seven

442
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,778
soon-to-be eight have transitioned them

443
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:05,269
to adult use and still have medical and

444
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:08,088
medical has like low taxes just normal

445
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:10,839
sales tax but then adult use has all of

446
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:14,329
these excise taxes sometimes almost 40%

447
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,519
like 11% for the state 20% for the city

448
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:18,409
in the town all the little donations all

449
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,610
of a sudden at the end of the day adult

450
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:22,308
use you go to buy a joint you're like

451
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,289
eighteen fifty or like twenty seven

452
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:26,419
dollars but then a medical joint might

453
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,769
be five dollars and each states a little

454
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,778
different so this danger zone that we're

455
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:33,318
gonna talk about you know kenny loggins

456
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:35,688
you know watch Top Gun I think you'll

457
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:36,948
get the references there so you know in

458
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:39,528
the United States we've got like Jeff

459
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:41,149
Sessions are angry little like troll or

460
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:42,438
like Keebler Elf they column like we

461
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,179
used to have this thing called the Kol

462
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:45,948
memorandum that said if states follow

463
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:47,808
eight specific rules they can

464
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:50,508
essentially have a medical marijuana

465
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:52,188
program we also have this omnibus last

466
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,990
year they brought Dana here from

467
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:57,558
California one of our great Senator

468
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,568
Representatives and he and Earl another

469
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,578
one from Oregon which thinks Oregon

470
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:03,110
people they have a bill that prevents

471
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:06,798
the federal government from spending

472
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,949
federal funds to prosecute state medical

473
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,959
marijuana programs I as an investor or

474
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:15,230
an operator I don't have a single

475
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,029
sentence of protection for recreational

476
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,980
marijuana and recreational marijuana

477
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:22,068
will be legal here in Germany someday

478
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,259
I'd give it five to eleven twelve years

479
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:26,029
like it's not a matter of like if this

480
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:27,949
is gonna happen it's a matter of when I

481
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:30,109
mean it's more and more medical research

482
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,940
efficacy and something that's really

483
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:33,859
unique to government's is tax revenue

484
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,779
and like my expression here and if

485
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:38,148
you're in the gubernatorial space I

486
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,639
regards but like tax revenue is heroin

487
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:42,619
to a government and like people that get

488
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,899
hooked on opiates or like heroin they

489
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,969
will steal their mommas TV and pawn it

490
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,808
to buy more drugs the same thing with

491
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,399
the government

492
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,928
we'll do anything they can to protect

493
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:53,268
their tax revenue because that's their

494
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:56,240
lifeblood and in Colorado we've of that

495
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:59,210
1.6 billion dollars last year we did

496
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,120
half a billion with a B in new tax

497
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,379
revenue in Colorado for new jobs hands

498
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,658
on jobs we have about sixty eight

499
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:07,668
thousand badge like licensed employees

500
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:08,950
to touch the plant but then you think

501
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,649
about all the plumbers electricians

502
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:15,528
carpenters lawyers consultants marketers

503
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:18,469
branders on and on and on velocity of

504
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:20,599
capital $1 in cannabis spent is 7.1

505
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,909
dollars of additional capital created

506
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,428
the highest velocity s you know

507
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:27,590
capitalists we've actually ever seen and

508
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:29,179
tracked and right now like trying to

509
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:31,459
navigate this space in order to get a

510
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,669
license every single place you have to

511
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,379
have real estate and that real estate

512
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:38,720
typically can't be too close to churches

513
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:40,638
schools parks daycares addiction centers

514
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,200
all these weird requirements and it has

515
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:43,878
to be zoned correctly it can't be

516
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,319
commercial maybe it has to be industrial

517
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:47,418
maybe they say it has to be in this

518
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,009
little business part compared to that so

519
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:52,669
if you don't have real estate you don't

520
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:54,618
have I say that to make everyone

521
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:57,169
understand that real estate is half of

522
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:59,480
this game I pay off real estate in about

523
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,799
three years you guys normally pay off

524
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,618
real estate you get a mortgage mortgage

525
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,240
the definition is until death like when

526
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:05,678
you can pay off real estate in three

527
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
years

528
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,528
something's happening correctly so when

529
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,089
you're finding your real estate and

530
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:12,138
choosing that space like that's the

531
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,788
place you're gonna plant your Lance

532
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:16,189
license flag and be able to actually

533
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:17,839
apply but these license applications be

534
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,090
it in Germany be it in Denmark be in

535
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,980
Jamaica be in LPS and Canada be it in

536
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:23,648
the States they're all different and

537
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,849
have very specific requirements

538
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:28,339
sometimes are challenging sometimes are

539
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,748
complex convoluted sometimes there's a

540
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,249
lot of corruption sometimes the

541
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:33,860
government will rescind and take back

542
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:36,618
all the licenses seem that now in two

543
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,969
states three countries so a lot of the

544
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:39,678
new states and governments are getting a

545
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,429
little bit more cautious realizing

546
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,129
there's this little thing called

547
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:46,070
lawsuits and litigation like back in the

548
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:47,839
day was like now litigation skyrocketing

549
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:49,069
so you have to insulate and protect

550
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,499
yourself from that downside and that's

551
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:53,210
why I say find good lawyers to structure

552
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:54,829
your contracts structure your deals and

553
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,058
follow their guidance most of the time

554
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,918
sometimes they're a little too

555
00:19:56,058 --> 00:20:00,288
willy-nilly and like oh don't take risks

556
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,100
you gotta take risks if you don't take

557
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:03,740
risks

558
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:05,509
you're not living and navigating this

559
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,640
space anything outside of like having

560
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,529
the right amount of money having your

561
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,419
right application having the right real

562
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:13,700
estate that's this one little place

563
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,840
that's not the danger zone but it's

564
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,580
still the danger zone because it's a

565
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,889
controlled substance in a country like

566
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:21,048
Germany or Denmark or Canada when it's

567
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,788
federally legal the danger zones not

568
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:24,889
it's bad but in the United States it is

569
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:27,279
that's why we've learned that real

570
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,270
estate is not growing cannabis or

571
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,178
manufacturing extracting it's not

572
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:33,918
dispensaries real estate is separate the

573
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:36,048
building separate the lights the

574
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,990
fertigation the tables the trays the TVs

575
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:40,730
in the dispensary the counters that's

576
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,319
not growing selling marijuana

577
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,909
so like you'll have a property

578
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,950
management company that buys all of

579
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,590
those hard assets and insulates them in

580
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,759
a company in the United States good or

581
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:51,980
bad we have this little thing from the

582
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,109
Supreme Court called citizens united it

583
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,870
pretty much means that like a gmbh or an

584
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,939
LLC or an ApS a company is kind of like

585
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:00,408
a person and people in the united states

586
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,110
have like these things like these

587
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:04,820
unalienable rights like freedom of

588
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:06,379
speech that's why like companies can

589
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:08,928
make massive donations to political

590
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,909
campaigns as an individual but it's also

591
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:12,860
like able to like insulate different

592
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:14,990
people doing different things so you

593
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:16,939
have one person one entity one company

594
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,589
that owns the the real estate owns the

595
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,308
lights does all the build up the

596
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:24,230
electricity everything other than soil

597
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:26,240
nutrients the paper for receipts in a

598
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,829
dispensary count like everything other

599
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,048
than the cannabis itself are directly

600
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:34,399
used to cultivate manufacture or sell it

601
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:36,440
is then leased to the company the LLC

602
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,970
that actually has the license so if that

603
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,370
company has a problem that can't seize

604
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,740
my assets and then I charge very high

605
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:44,209
lease payments very high rent and suck a

606
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,349
lot of capital out of that company

607
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,240
making tons of money into a company

608
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,158
that's not subject to the same taxes

609
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,048
legally and your corporate veil is

610
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,330
critical here find good lawyers to do

611
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:55,339
this good accountants but when you do

612
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:57,470
this you realize that 70% of the money

613
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:59,538
you need is an operator isn't even

614
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,519
cannabis money but then in our world

615
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:03,798
banks institutional capital will not

616
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,990
make those investments so knowing these

617
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:07,970
structures even in Germany even in any

618
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,380
country you have to know how to like

619
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,089
you've got to know the rules to play the

620
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,559
game so if you're going to get into this

621
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:14,839
space and you want to get into Germany

622
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,730
you want to get into Colombia you want

623
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,230
get into India what are the rules

624
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,509
governing the place where does their

625
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,798
current policy laws and ordinances and

626
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,569
how long is it gonna take for some of

627
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,369
those things to change and if you have a

628
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:27,019
significant business interest there or

629
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:28,609
would like to how do you take this

630
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:31,009
little thing called like a lever out and

631
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:33,378
actually apply force and leverage to

632
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,878
actually make that program legal so if

633
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:36,648
you are a business owner remember I said

634
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:39,469
this isn't like not just opportunity its

635
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:41,449
responsibility all of the nonprofit

636
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,940
organizations in the United States drug

637
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,370
policy Alliance Marijuana Policy Project

638
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,470
Americans for safe access great

639
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:50,868
nonprofits that helped to get medical

640
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,460
marijuana legalized you have to support

641
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:55,009
them you have to donate because the

642
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,569
reason that you're here today is

643
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:58,579
actually because those groups did their

644
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:00,888
job and got more and more legal more and

645
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:02,319
more businesses so got to stay out of

646
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:04,368
the danger zone

647
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,019
poor guy the other day had a little

648
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:07,519
problem in the states if you know who

649
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:09,589
this is you know I'm talking about

650
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,419
there's this funny show called Silicon

651
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:14,089

652
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:15,619

00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:18,740
there's this character and he has this

655
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,839
little incubator and we always say we're

656
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,730

00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,888
try to find unicorns and I want to find

661
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,419
them before like I want to find a baby

662
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:34,579
unicorn in the forest and no one's found

663
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,679
yet and feed that Unicorn the best food

664
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:38,329
and like make it the best unicorn in the

665
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,159
world because out of all the companies

666
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:42,378
if you have something that's like no one

667
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,149
cares about a million dollars but like

668
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:46,849
you do start to care when it gets to a

669
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:48,918
billion or beyond that when you look at

670
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:50,808
Zuckerberg like last week all that's

671
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,340
happening thirty-three-year-old just

672
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:53,960
sitting in front of like Senate House

673
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:55,849
committees defending something that's

674
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,119
pretty much every single one of them use

675
00:23:55,849 --> 00:24:01,278
their grandkids use like when you start

676
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:02,959
a company you're thinking about exit and

677
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,999
if you don't know about exit strategy

678
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,110
you don't need to have a company it's

679
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:08,600
not just I'm gonna start a company and

680
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:10,189
do this for years that sucks like it

681
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,689
gets hard you need more money there's

682
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,308
all these pressures and problems how are

683
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,360
you gonna sell your company how are you

684
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:15,618
gonna get more investment into the

685
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:18,258
company you don't want to be cleaning

686
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:19,459
the toilets every single day I mean I

687
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,860
cleaned some toilets in an office in

688
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,940
Colorado last week I was like I came in

689
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:25,158
there's a meeting there's a dirty toilet

690
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,419
it's a CEO sometimes you do that but you

691
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:28,009
don't want to do that forever and

692
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:28,310
hopefully you hire good people and scale

693
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,470
and

694
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:32,480
eventually sell your business or your

695
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,640
business goes public or you do an M&amp;A

696
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,930
like a merger and acquisition which even

697
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,700
earlier we were mentioning how mergers

698
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,710
and acquisitions are kind of like MMA

699
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,210
like mixed martial arts fighting like

700
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,340
those cage fighting like when you do and

701
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,690
merge your acquisitions like that but

702
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,609
we're always looking for the Unicorn but

703
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,500
the problem in that everyone thinks

704
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:51,469
they're a unicorn and the realistic

705
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,680
truth is 99% of them are not actually

706
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,299
99.9% of them or not so if you make an

707
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,350
investment into a company as an investor

708
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,059
this is where we're a little different

709
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:03,769
that company has a 99% chance of failing

710
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,539
even if it's your company I mean today

711
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,519
or this month I had four companies that

712
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:09,319
turn one turn five a couple more turn

713
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,700
four a couple more turn three it's

714
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:12,950
always fun when you get past that five

715
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,509
year mark or a three-year mark or you

716
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,370
have a significant investment come in

717
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:18,410
but it's not just like money's flying

718
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:19,969
like in order to be a unicorn it takes

719
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,509
the structuring unique competitive

720
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,400
advantage in order to do that so the

721
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:27,680
things I look at when I'm creating a

722
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,660
company or evaluating like an investment

723
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,190
opportunity anything from you know

724
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,750
twenty thousand dollars to twenty five

725
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,029
million dollars is the space that we've

726
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,470
worked in for size and investments I'm

727
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:38,389
always thinking like what's the market

728
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,309
risk like what happens if the state or

729
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,930
the country takes away the licenses or

730
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:45,079
the market changes and we can't make

731
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:47,269
certain products what's the product risk

732
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,519
if you're making vaporizers and you use

733
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:51,529
glycol or flavor additives or it has

734
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,259
pesticides and it gets a recall the

735
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:55,609
brand damage will crush you so it's like

736
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:58,519
what are the risks associated with this

737
00:25:55,609 --> 00:26:00,019
product like cannabis drug driving like

738
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,359
there's all these things in Colorado

739
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:04,579
there was a really unfortunate case of

740
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,979
like a college student committed suicide

741
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:08,359
he had eaten a lot of edibles and back

742
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,920
in the day in Colorado you could sell

743
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:13,729
like a thousand milligrams chokolate bar

744
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,500
like of THC there's a lot like

745
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,059
California like all these huge things

746
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,890
these Kiva bars that are just enormous

747
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,740
and people when it's the first time

748
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,390
trying a product it's our responsibility

749
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,309
to provide them a quality experience

750
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,750
because I'm not selling products I'm

751
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:28,519
selling the experience that those

752
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,039
products are going to induce in my

753
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,480
clients and that that experience needs

754
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,899
to be enjoyable from the moment they see

755
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,309
my logo walk into a store like how

756
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,900
they're treated in the store how they

757
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,429
see our website like that experience

758
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,269
from how the product is how they feel

759
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,370
the next day

760
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:45,769
that's why you have a responsibility to

761
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:47,389
your patients to your clients to create

762
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:51,259
high quality products and not have risk

763
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,220
and the last one is team risk at the end

764
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,660
of the day you can have the best

765
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,400
financials in the world the best

766
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,980
intellectual property patents on all

767
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,870
this cool stuff then the damn giving my

768
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,069
money to you and that's why I like

769
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:03,139
investors at the end of the day they're

770
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:04,519
giving their money to us by doing due

771
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,290
diligence to then invest into the

772
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,210
companies that we know that we're giving

773
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:09,649
it to the people and if your team is not

774
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,569
strong if you're an individual and you

775
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,250
have an idea you're not investable

776
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:15,109
because it's not protected you got a

777
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,750
couple people if you have a great idea

778
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:19,789
like you need a like to bring in like a

779
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,769
CFO financial person and an operational

780
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:23,509
person good legal good people actually

781
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:26,509
execute on that vision so I always

782
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:28,640
analyze teams so if you're in this how

783
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:29,960
do you actually become gravity and bring

784
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,180
other people towards you if you're a

785
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,680
good cannabis grower like you know that

786
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,720
idea like master grower doesn't mean

787
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,190
master business person like if you're

788
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,569
great at growing cannabis but you don't

789
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,400
know business you'd better find some

790
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:42,829
business help is like master grower

791
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,810
master up every single business

792
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,389
that's been cultivation that has had

793
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:49,879
horrible failures or run by a master

794
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,380
grower and God bless him but they didn't

795
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,940
maybe go to Wharton they didn't go to

796
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,650
Stanford they didn't have business

797
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,870
classes they don't understand LLC's

798
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,000
deductions depreciation and if you're

799
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:01,159
not using banks which there are banks in

800
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,950
the US that Bank for us you have so much

801
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,480
risk and liability so how do you get

802
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,710
good people as part of your team is

803
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,059
something that's always really critical

804
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:12,350
to understand you know so from a Esiason

805
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:16,159
in like I wanted to talk a little bit

806
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:18,079
today about like anti anti fragile so

807
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,100
when I'm looking at investments or

808
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,269
market something that's a little

809
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:24,319
different that I want you to think about

810
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:26,000
is fragility like you know a nice and

811
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,220
then like if I were to take my phone and

812
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,430
pour water on it it's gonna break it's

813
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,779
fragile it's done now if it's robust if

814
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,299
it's strong enough like I could pour

815
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,279
water on it nothing's gonna happen but

816
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:39,470
if it's anti fragile if I hit this with

817
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,240
a hammer and throw it down the stairs it

818
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,420
gets stronger and better every single

819
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,009
time so in the market like I deal with a

820
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,140
lot with public companies and private

821
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:49,700
companies and looking at like what Wall

822
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,320
Street traders did back in the day or

823
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,059
now even shorting companies knowing

824
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,878
there's a bad company we we do market

825
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:57,009
regulation through and

826
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:58,808
if there's a bad company we can short

827
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,220
stocks like borrow stocks short their

828
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:02,528
stocks if we know something's gonna go

829
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,970
bad it crushes those but if you bet

830
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:05,950
wrong like you'll actually get crushed

831
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,778
and destroyed so like be very careful if

832
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,038
you play in that space like I've had

833
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,210
great days but then there's some days

834
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,859
you're like I wish I didn't wake up this

835
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,210
morning but then the next day if the

836
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:14,439
news comes out then it's good again but

837
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,569
you got to be able to maintain that

838
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,519
pressure so you want to find a place to

839
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:20,528
where it's like you're anti fragile if

840
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,359
the market changes it doesn't crush you

841
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:24,730
it makes you stronger or you have

842
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:29,189
options against some of your hedge bets

843
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:31,240
so like I said 99% of companies fail and

844
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:34,149
biologically like Leo Wilson he said

845
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,190
like 99.9% of all species that have ever

846
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,868
lived are extinct and like we're kind of

847
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,700
here in this like present moment like

848
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:41,319
the dinosaurs other than like when big

849
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,960
meteor had about 70 million years ago

850
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,490
like we got a few dinosaurs left like

851
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,558
birds and a few of those but most of

852
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,149
them just died off and then here like

853
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:50,888
mammals all these things have evolved

854
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:52,868
the same thing with companies if a

855
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:54,609
massive thing happens how do you know

856
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:56,288
that you're not gonna be affected if you

857
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:58,990
have an investment into one company and

858
00:29:56,288 --> 00:30:00,490
there's trouble you're done so that's

859
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,409
why like I invest into portfolio

860
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,269
companies lots and lots of companies

861
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:06,009
that pass our due diligence and I spread

862
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:08,288
that out amongst them so I diversify

863
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:10,288
risk but you have to do due diligence on

864
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:12,669
each and every investment opportunity or

865
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:13,960
opportunity is at the end of the day the

866
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:16,690
worst thing that you can lose is

867
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,399
opportunity costs like you got one time

868
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,929
one life and thank you for like giving

869
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,398
me about 30-40 minutes to like share

870
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,320
some of my things with you with your

871
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:25,449
life so you can do better but like you

872
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,308
don't want to waste your time time is

873
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,048
the only thing like we have and it's

874
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:32,230
like the present like a gift Christmas

875
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:33,638
like it's the present moments all we got

876
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,710
so how are you gonna use it and this

877
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:37,599
industry is like once in a lifetime the

878
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,278
dot-com boom that happened is very

879
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,748
similar Canadian companies with

880
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,019
valuations of 150 to 250 X revenue is

881
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:45,940
ridiculous

882
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:47,319
but like you look at certain things

883
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,249
there's good things too you go public

884
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,439
you have a press release you make a

885
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:51,669
hundred million dollars in a day I would

886
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,259
love a day I can just raise a hundred

887
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:54,730
million dollars as a private fund but

888
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:57,190
like there are advantages to being

889
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,899
public but there's downside too so you

890
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,580
have to be very very insulated from risk

891
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,798
if you are going to have some of those

892
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:04,599
opportunities you know you can see it's

893
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,308
like on certain curves like when things

894
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,629
are going up it's great when they're

895
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:09,069
going down like that

896
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,500
what crushes companies how do you

897
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:13,539
insulate from risk so that if there is a

898
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,400
bad day it doesn't crush you or like

899
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,990
your other companies do well or if it's

900
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,690
bad for this company it's actually good

901
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,640
for your other companies so why I like

902
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,650
Ninh is like he was an investment banker

903
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,090
and like stock trader for years and

904
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,680
years and he went into philosophy and

905
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:29,109
then started to realize the philosophy

906
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,000
of investing and it really one of his

907
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:33,819
best messages it's like on being anti

908
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,950
fragile like be anti fragile or die and

909
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:37,509
if you're just one company you have to

910
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,549
insulate yourself from all those risks

911
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:41,230
from like your team quitting on you from

912
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:43,149
your product like getting recalls or

913
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,549
like causing problems or not having

914
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,840
enough you know capital or the market

915
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:49,000
changing that's why you don't go into

916
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:50,470
all markets but if it's good why not go

917
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,849
into a few markets at the same time

918
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,470
because then if one fails you're still

919
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:55,509
good that's why we diversified out of

920
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,470
the United States four years ago because

921
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:57,910
it's like well if the whole federal

922
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,370
government goes bad I have to provide

923
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,870
liquidity to my investors so we need to

924
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:03,250
have more diverse markets and there's

925
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:06,369
more diverse opportunities and this

926
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,509
plant needs to be legal everywhere it's

927
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,549
just at the end of the day this is a

928
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,839
very sacred medicinal plant I was home

929
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:12,039
schooled by a botanist for a couple

930
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,199
years in middle school and did a lot of

931
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,839
like field sampling and it's just such a

932
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,519
special plant and it's not ours like

933
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:20,259
we're holding it for future generations

934
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,389
and the businesses we're creating the

935
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:24,369
day will be like the Pepsi's and the

936
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,630
coca cola's of the world but not

937
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:27,579
everyone's gonna get to be that but

938
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,620
everyone thinks they're going to be so

939
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:31,000
you really and I put all the puppies in

940
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:32,109
here just cuz some of some of my talks

941
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,819
at downer so I just wanted to keep

942
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:37,059
everybody like happy like with pictures

943
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:38,439
of puppies sorry you know you've seen

944
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:39,309
Shark Tank you've seen some of these

945
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,049
things there's all these little

946
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,480
companies just getting crushed I mean

947
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:45,009
every day I mean probably a week I'm

948
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,779
going through probably 20 to 30

949
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:48,400
investments a week and maybe two to

950
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:50,019
three of those move over to a pile that

951
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,060
I might look and then push to my

952
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:54,369
investment committee there are so many

953
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:55,690
opportunities but it's easy to see when

954
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:57,759
you've had the experience with hundreds

955
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,529
of companies and markets what's good and

956
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,849
what's not and at the end of the day it

957
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:02,619
all comes down to the team because even

958
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,750
if the markets crap a good team can

959
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:08,079
change a market I've seen it time and

960
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,220
time again but you have to scale like

961
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,240
what's that accent how are you gonna

962
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,100
plan this how are you gonna get

963
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,630
liquidity for your investors how are you

964
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:15,579
gonna make money yourself because at the

965
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,620
end of the day it's not just about the

966
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,970
money but like the money's nice but you

967
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:20,069
gotta use the money to build the

968
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,110
business

969
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:24,029
constantly like on this one just like

970
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:25,500
the Indian philosophy of like keep every

971
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:27,480
dollar in your company for a thousand

972
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,250
days you must keep doing that keep

973
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,960
reinvesting reinvesting this is not

974
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,210
going to slow down or stop anytime soon

975
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,100
so if you want big impact you want big

976
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,259
profits don't suck

977
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:38,909
number one rule like pretty much and the

978
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:40,890
number one rule with me and my investors

979
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:45,090
is like don't lose investors money

980
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:47,220
number two C rule number one like that's

981
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:49,139
the number one thing you have to focus

982
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,370
on you do not want to like piss off

983
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,770
investors because they actually have

984
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:54,479
backing and will come after you write

985
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:57,839
good operating agreements like write

986
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,190
good contracts very very important when

987
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,720
you think about a little plant and like

988
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,769
just you know seeing the denmark world

989
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,549
it's like you see a little plant and

990
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:04,230
then now it's turning into

991
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:05,730
pharmaceutical products like everything

992
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,559
that we know in the united states that's

993
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,630
medical and recreational will merge into

994
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,190
one thing someday and then there's this

995
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,950
other thing that's called like pharmacy

996
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,809
like big pharma like IP like specific

997
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,789
titration medical research like body

998
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:20,639
mass index to where this product does

999
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:22,289
this almost every single time the value

1000
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,670
in those like i've diversified into a

1001
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:25,349
lot of investments on that side there's

1002
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,450
gonna be more and more and more of that

1003
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:29,339
but eventually in the US cannabis will

1004
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:31,559
probably be under like the atf Alcohol

1005
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:35,579
Tobacco Firearms cannabis all the fun

1006
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,750
things you know so I'm a surfer actually

1007
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,739
like skipped a meeting right before my

1008
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,199
flight to go surfing because there's

1009
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,539
some good swell in Malibu I live really

1010
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,069
close to there and you know this is a

1011
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,329
place called rink cone and you see all

1012
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,850
those little dots it's this amazing

1013
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:49,319
Point Break and when a waves coming in

1014
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:50,909
it's just like everyone's trying to get

1015
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,970
into the market everyone wants to catch

1016
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,649
that really amazing

1017
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:56,819
once-in-a-lifetime wave but you can't

1018
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,930
catch it here on the right you can't

1019
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,670
catch it on the left there's ten other

1020
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:02,429
guys paddling for it how do you know

1021
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,019
where to position yourself for when to

1022
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:06,329
catch it how to paddle and then when to

1023
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,460
pop up I use that analogy of like in

1024
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:09,690
investing there's lots of waves and some

1025
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,860
of them suck like you can see it

1026
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,450
sometimes right that's just gonna be

1027
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,280
like a closeout and just crash other

1028
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:15,359
times it's really big here and you're

1029
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,910
like if I catch it right there I can

1030
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,980
ride it all the way to the right but all

1031
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:22,529
waves - you gotta know when to exit and

1032
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,269
get off the wave like one of my favorite

1033
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,860
little Topanga point like you ride a

1034
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:27,900
wave too early gets so shallow and then

1035
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,070
you like fall and like break yourself so

1036
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,410
it's like you got to know when to exit

1037
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,580
the wave - and like s risk you can't

1038
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:34,259
just get knocked out with like a

1039
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,480
surfboard those fins the Blake it's

1040
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,220
dangerous so like how do you catch a

1041
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,050
wave how do you choose a company how do

1042
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,549
you choose an investment and it comes

1043
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,530
from like sitting on your board and like

1044
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,030
watching out there or like us with our

1045
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,010
data companies and analysts I've got

1046
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,720
homies up on the shore with like

1047
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,040
magnifying glasses like looking out in

1048
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,139
the ocean like hey there's a good wave

1049
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:53,639
coming in like 30 seconds everyone else

1050
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:55,199
sees the little ones close to them and

1051
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,210
they like go for those I'm just sitting

1052
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,460
there waiting I'm not wasting my time on

1053
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,990
these crap little waves like I'm waiting

1054
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,970
for those good ones but I like to like

1055
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:04,379
catch a good one exit and more and more

1056
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:06,089
and then with more and more investors we

1057
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,809
catch more and more waves and then it's

1058
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,820
good for everybody

1059
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,809
you know from Colorado that's where I

1060
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,180
got into this industry I love

1061
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:14,009
backcountry like snow snowboarding I

1062
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:15,750
didn't obviously being a CEO now I don't

1063
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,790
have as much time but it used to take me

1064
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,619
sometimes five hours to skin and climb

1065
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:21,090
up a whole mountain and I'm not talking

1066
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,639
like a ski resort with like the chairs

1067
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,320
like I was a backcountry instructor

1068
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,879
avalanche instructor mountain guide and

1069
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,960
it would take clients out but then for

1070
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,090
myself like we would climb these

1071
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,940
mountains and then just like the fresh

1072
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,440
powder turns ARF I mean it's like better

1073
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,380
than sex drugs and rock and roll

1074
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,880
combined like better than surfing even

1075
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,010
because it's like you're riding a whole

1076
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,940
mountain and you know Louie dog and I

1077
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,740
it's like when you get those first

1078
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,570
tracks those good investments it's great

1079
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:47,519
but you got to go out if it's really

1080
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,890
dangerous avalanche conditions I don't

1081
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,300
go out like I know I die and if you're a

1082
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:53,279
company you also know you're gonna die

1083
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,110
so it's like one of the days that are

1084
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,360
good do your research do your homework

1085
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,250
do your due diligence find good people

1086
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,500
look at all of the other failures that

1087
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,199
everyone's doing and realize like what

1088
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,849
not to do like and always be crushing

1089
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:07,799
it's not about closing it's about

1090
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,839
crushing like every single day this is a

1091
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,269
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I've

1092
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,780
done this you know almost lay out 13 14

1093
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:16,829
years now I'm not stopping like it's not

1094
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,350
about like do this for a few more years

1095
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:21,090
and then like retire or like you know go

1096
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:22,769
get a job selling cars or something like

1097
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,510
this is it and if you're in here and

1098
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:25,860
like you're not 90 and you're not like

1099
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,300
eighteen or two like this is the only

1100
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,190
thing we're doing and if you're in this

1101
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,750
room I think you realize that and it's

1102
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,880
not about if you grow cannabis or know

1103
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,860
anything about that what did you do in

1104
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,450
your past business life are you a

1105
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,490
pharmacist are you a doctor are you an

1106
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:40,889
investor are you a marketer how do you

1107
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:42,449
take those past industry skills and like

1108
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:44,219
leverage it to cannabis because cannabis

1109
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:44,868
needs marketing cannabis needs real

1110
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:46,068
estate can

1111
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,740
this needs all of those things

1112
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:50,960
compliance directives I had a guy five

1113
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:52,189
years ago in Colorado he he ran a trash

1114
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,599
company was a friend of mine he's like

1115
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,608
Nick how do I get into this and like I

1116
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,079
have all these producers that have all

1117
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:58,639
of this like plant material they have to

1118
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,630
shred it with plant shredders and kitty

1119
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,219
litter and soil and make it

1120
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,440
unrecognizable before they put it in the

1121
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:04,489
garbage a lot dumpster like maybe come

1122
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,079
up with a company where you have these

1123
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:07,338
little bins and like pick them up and

1124
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,930
like you do all the shredding and just

1125
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:10,518
take away the risk and then you don't

1126
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:11,058
have rotting plant material sitting

1127
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:12,618
around

1128
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:15,289
I mean he's now doing like four or five

1129
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:17,269
million dollars a year doing garbage for

1130
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:18,589
the cannabis industry and just shredding

1131
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:20,239
their plants and now he's thinking about

1132
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:22,400
scaling that and licensing that to other

1133
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,929
states like there's an idea for

1134
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,670
everything in the space but you have to

1135
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:27,919
be like know how to execute on those

1136
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,869
because like everyone wants to jump into

1137
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,180
this but like you got to look before you

1138
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:33,410
jump in I see tons of companies they're

1139
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,659
just like we're gonna do this and go for

1140
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:37,399
a license and like we're gonna start a

1141
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:39,170
new dispensary in downtown Colorado in

1142
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,849
Denver but there were tons of them

1143
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,528
they're like this isn't you don't get a

1144
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:44,599
5,000 square-foot grill in Colorado

1145
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,579
anymore or Oregon anymore or California

1146
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,349
anymore it's like you have to know what

1147
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:49,818
timing in which market just like which

1148
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:52,009
mountain to climb which wave to catch

1149
00:38:49,818 --> 00:38:54,108
which company to start and which ones

1150
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:56,798
just to like realize or more of a risk

1151
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:58,909
and a liability than an actual asset and

1152
00:38:56,798 --> 00:39:00,018
like we all want to jump and have fun

1153
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:01,518
together and you always have that one

1154
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:03,919
friend or that one company that sucks

1155
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:05,838
and like you like laugh and giggle at

1156
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,730
them but like we're all in this together

1157
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,318
and it's such a big market it's not like

1158
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,880
I hate other investors I hate other

1159
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:13,009
consulting companies I hate other data

1160
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,140
companies I a lot of my competitors I

1161
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:16,548
actually buy their data like we're all

1162
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:18,318
in this together and then sometimes a

1163
00:39:16,548 --> 00:39:20,389
position for me is like too big I can't

1164
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:21,768
do it all it's like who else am I gonna

1165
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:24,318
go to like piggyback and work together

1166
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:26,149
on projects so it's collaboration like

1167
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:27,889
whenever you look at a society that had

1168
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,170
collaboration versus competition they

1169
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:31,818
last 3 times longer same thing actually

1170
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,440
with matrilineal societies female

1171
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:35,599
societies you never have to question who

1172
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,769
the mother of a child is right makes a

1173
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,980
lot more sense if you keep the mother's

1174
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:38,629
name

1175
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,400
they also last three times longer

1176
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,019
because they have intergenerational

1177
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,269
connectivity like they're thinking about

1178
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:45,798
things differently like some cultures

1179
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:47,238
the men got to choose if they got to go

1180
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:49,429
to war but the women got to choose if

1181
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:53,858
they got to bring weapons a little off

1182
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:57,018
topic there but diversify very important

1183
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:58,308
so yeah I've gotten 26 states so far 11

1184
00:39:57,018 --> 00:40:01,518
countries where I've been active

1185
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:03,890
of still active and like I said I talked

1186
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:04,998
to 17 countries yesterday and some of

1187
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:06,798
them it's like I already know your laws

1188
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:07,968
in programming it's horrible others it's

1189
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:09,139
like there's not even conversation

1190
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:11,139
others it's like oh you're one of those

1191
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:14,028
for license holders in that country

1192
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:15,438
let's talk here's my card like what

1193
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:17,599
stage of this are you in because we

1194
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:20,239
design we do every step of this process

1195
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,739
and good teams like you got to find

1196
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,269
those good lawyers those good investors

1197
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:25,219
those good consultants to help you with

1198
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:26,688
your part of the piece and like if

1199
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:28,309
there's great partnership potential look

1200
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:30,018
for it but like build a company for

1201
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:32,630
yourself initially and learn from

1202
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:34,008
markets like each individual market like

1203
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,900
when you see like all the different dots

1204
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:37,219
where you know this isn't like within

1205
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,989
the last year I've been to every one of

1206
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:40,249
those those dots there I've got a couple

1207
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:41,499
offices in the States we don't talk

1208
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:44,149
about the states there's too many dots

1209
00:40:41,498 --> 00:40:45,919
it's happening like it's not like is

1210
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,999
this gonna happen no it already happened

1211
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,068
it actually you've kind of missed the

1212
00:40:46,998 --> 00:40:50,988
boat on a few markets already but there

1213
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:52,728
are more and more markets the United

1214
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:54,469
States is small in population compared

1215
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:58,958
to the rest of the world and there's so

1216
00:40:54,469 --> 00:41:02,929
many opportunities so yeah that's right

1217
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:04,848
Oh perfect well timing well part I I

1218
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:06,528
didn't even they gave me a laser to I

1219
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:09,259
was excited about it to use it but I

1220
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:10,329
never did you cannot you can amuse a cat

1221
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,829
later

1222
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:14,150
well again I really appreciate the time

1223
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:16,278
to share I know some of this is

1224
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,619
challenging to hear but like when you

1225
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:20,119
fight the truth alleles and this all

1226
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:22,729
comes from real-world experience so I'm

1227
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,380
not sure if anytime or not but we'll be

1228
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:25,909
around all day wish you all the best of

1229
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,410
luck and success and remember do this

1230
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:28,848
for the patients but do it with the

1231
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:31,879
business because then you can help more

1232
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:38,259
patients thank you Nick easily everybody

1233
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:38,259
