1
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,879
so you've got an attorney and then

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,879
you've got an economist my God

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,719
okay so my name is Bo Whitney I'm going

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,000
to talk today about kind of the

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,198
economics of cannabis

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,820
um

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,439
I have a

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,219
let's see here

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,219
I have a

10
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:36,479
oh I have a presentation

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,980
there we go so I'm going to give it a

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,099
broad overview about what's going on in

13
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,019
the market globally the U.S just people

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,100
are always talking about the US and then

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,219
narrow it down to Europe and then uh

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,500
Germany in particular

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,500
um now a little bit about mini economics

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,619
we're a global data and research firm we

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,299
do Consulting pretty well known we have

20
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,919
clients all over the world we're based

21
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,718
out of Portland Oregon and the United

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,379
States

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,260
so as Bob mentioned there's this growing

24
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,420
expansive of countries that are

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,280
legalizing either hemp or adult use or

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,040
medical

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,739
this is just growing day-to-day

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
um a lot to keep up with

29
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:25,019
um the I think the key message here is

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,059
that even excluding him you've got a

31
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,199
large Market got a large number of

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,200
consumers in the way

33
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,959
so in terms of the U.S

34
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:39,599
so what my firm does is we gather data

35
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,500
on all these markets we look at Trends

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:46,559
we look at ramping scenarios from

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,739
country to Country state to state and

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,040
then we put out protections and so our

39
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:55,739
projection for

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,700
20 to 22 is about 29 billion dollars in

41
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:06,419
the US and it's growing up to about well

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:11,280
81 82 billion by 2030. now uh in the U.S

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,080
right now uh this whole covid surge in

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
demand is over there was a lot of

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,140
working from home or as I called it

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,300
working from Stone and they were able to

47
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:22,979
consume uh more and more because they

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,080
didn't have to go to work and so they

49
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:30,539
could work well under the influence

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,400
now that surges over and so these the

51
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,799
pattern the growth rates and all this

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
internet since are going back to the

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,560
growth rates that you saw in 2019

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,318
pre-coded and so it's kind of

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,219
normalizing where the growth really is

56
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:50,818
in the market is in these new emerging

57
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,219
states such as New York New Jersey uh

58
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:54,919
the the more mature markets like Oregon

59
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:58,620
Washington Colorado

60
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:01,139
that peaked their now just basically

61
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,500
steadiating a lot of the growth is based

62
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,000
upon population growth and so of new

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,039
markets are coming online

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,439
and that's where the growth is that's

65
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,719
where the opportunities are now not

66
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,378
every state has the same opportunities

67
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:20,039
of course but right now there's this

68
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:24,060
talk about will inflation in the United

69
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,919
States will that impact demand we're not

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,180
really seeing that we're seeing more

71
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:33,179
deflation in products that are going to

72
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,840
Market where we see inflation's impact

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,340
on the market it's when in the startups

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,539
so deflation product pricing

75
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,500
softening of demand due to coveted

76
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:51,419
returns but inflation 25 to 40 percent

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:54,000
inflation for construction for breaking

78
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,238
up in dispensaries and in in that life

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,340
so this will have an impact on

80
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,099
new markets like New York New Jersey

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,620
Pennsylvania and like just how much of

82
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,719
an impact not quite sure yet but it's

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,319
definitely a present something to be

84
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,318
considered

85
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,599
so EU so

86
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,180
um

87
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,819
like I said we've we've built this these

88
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,680
models there's uh the total Market

89
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,680
having Hangouts for a second

90
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,620
thanks

91
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,379
um the total accessible Market in in

92
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,379
Europe is right around 63 billion

93
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,879
dollars now that's illicit and legal

94
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:47,219
combined

95
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,319
um most of the countries are starting to

96
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,139
reform or they want to reform and

97
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,418
they're really looking at Germany to

98
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,819
um to be their guide throughout this

99
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,698
whole reform process but I think the

100
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,019
reform throughout Europe is inevitable

101
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,080
um now

102
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:07,859
who will supply into these reforming

103
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,959
countries while our models indicate that

104
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,660
the countries that are on the outside

105
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,060
the fringes of Europe will be the

106
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,820
low-cost suppliers into the European

107
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:21,538
Union once Things become regionalized

108
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:24,659
right now every country seemingly wants

109
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:26,819
to supply into Europe so you've got Asia

110
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,280
you've got South America you've got

111
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,740
Africa but there's only so much Market

112
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,899
to go around so

113
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,478
um so when you're contemplating

114
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,000
supplying into Europe be very very

115
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:42,418
careful about oversupply

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,319
now there's not a whole lot of data

117
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:48,439
um about the European market but there's

118
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,319
more and more

119
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:54,240
insistence by Regulators by members

120
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,879
States younger countries to start

121
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,500
Gathering data so that we can do a

122
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,120
better job of predicting what's going on

123
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,839
in the market

124
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,959
and so data is a key issue throughout

125
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,959
every Market signaling um in the world

126
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,740
um so five countries make up about 62

127
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,919
percent of the total demand

128
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:21,139
in Europe have listed the five countries

129
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:24,779
here Italy France Germany UK expand

130
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,478
but these uses remedies this total

131
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:29,219
Market is rather underreported because

132
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,818
there's this Latin data

133
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:36,199
so for example my firm is estimating

134
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:40,379
that there's about 37 million consumers

135
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:43,379
22 million is being reported by the

136
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,379
United Nations and it could be as high

137
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,759
as 150 million if you include a lot of

138
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,680
these periphery uh European countries

139
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,098
so pretty substantial Market it's the

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,740
second largest market

141
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:59,779
for Revenue purpose right now in the

142
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,639
world

143
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:05,279
however Asia and Africa have the most

144
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,598
consumers in the world so it's important

145
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,598
to make that distinction

146
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,259
so I want to give a little bit of time

147
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,159
on the training

148
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,919
um

149
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,199
that

150
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:21,538
post-legalization ramp will capture a

151
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,000
greater percentage of the legal demand

152
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,699
so

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,220
it'll capture more of the demand in

154
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,500
Germany than in the U.S but less in

155
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,080
Canada and what I mean by that is that

156
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,019
by mapping out these ramps and seeing

157
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,240
how the structures are evolving and the

158
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,519
like the demand is rather predictable

159
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,340
and the conversion from the illicit

160
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,918
Market consumer to Legal Market consumer

161
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:49,519
and so if you look at it just from a

162
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,918
first year second or third year

163
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:56,219
Germany should do a better job of

164
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:59,579
capturing the legal consumer than the

165
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,740
United States but Canada was really Off

166
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,538
to the Races and so they did a

167
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,720
reasonable job even though they're kind

168
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:09,060
of peaking and stalling right now and

169
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,720
then ultimately

170
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,319
um

171
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,840
you know where it goes in terms of

172
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,000
Germany and how much legal capture how

173
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,679
much consumer demand it will be

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,860
supported by the legal Market that will

175
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,139
really depend upon the rollout of the

176
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,199
regulatory structure and that's still on

177
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,240
the same flex but right now you know by

178
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,000
2030

179
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,120
there should be about 5.4 billion

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,399
dollars in legal sales and so that's

181
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,799
pretty significant

182
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,480
um you know 2 billion or 2.1 billion by

183
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:50,099
2025. now this incorporates the delay in

184
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,440
the rollout that 2024 starts it seemed

185
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,240
we're predicting that it's going to

186
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,660
alter a little bit out of the day of

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,759
2024 and then really take off by 2025

188
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:02,278
but

189
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,559
you know 5.4 billion dollars it's a

190
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,659
pretty sizable market and that that's

191
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,739
not even including some of the demand

192
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,719
that's going to come in from Canada

193
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,019
tourism

194
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:18,480
um but the key to a successful ramp

195
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:20,940
is based upon access the more people the

196
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,220
more access they have in stores and

197
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,420
retail outlets and the like uh the

198
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,060
better

199
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:30,179
um and it's easier for consumers to

200
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:33,079
participate if they can go down the

201
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:36,838
street rather than drive 25 kilometers

202
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:40,860
and price price plays a real important

203
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,980
role in the amount of capture because if

204
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,440
the consumer feels as though they're

205
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,060
paying too much of a premium relative to

206
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,920
the illicit market then they just won't

207
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,239
participate or the level of

208
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,879
participation will slow down

209
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,480
dramatically so it's going to take a

210
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,700
while to ramp in Germany it always does

211
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,240
but then eventually and they'll gain

212
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,240
some traction

213
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,600
so you know my firm not only looks at

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,540
the ramps and that's demand looks at

215
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,100
jobs looks at taxes but we also have an

216
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:18,419
office on Supply

217
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,379
and I think one of the often overlooked

218
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:25,559
parts of regulatory deployments is

219
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:27,600
sizing the supply appropriately it's

220
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,838
been mentioned multiple times today that

221
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,200
the supply is actually too little even

222
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,360
to support the medical

223
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,700
marketonius Market but based on the

224
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,220
total addressable Market that's solicit

225
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,480
and legal the total Supply that's

226
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,720
required

227
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,539
is about 950

228
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,839
000 kilos that's

229
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:55,379
you know hundreds of metric tons versus

230
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,079
the 10 to 25 that are in place right now

231
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:00,659
so as it comes to

232
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:04,278
regulatory deployments it's really

233
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:07,679
critical to make sure that

234
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:11,039
the the country stays ahead of the

235
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,559
supplies so that it doesn't constrain

236
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,219
the market unnecessarily

237
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,739
and so if you under Supply

238
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,600
it can really harm the market by keeping

239
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,440
prices too high because it's supply and

240
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,800
demand

241
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,200
if you over Supply prices crash and then

242
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,659
it doesn't help anybody that tax

243
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,519
revenues are

244
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:35,578
sub-optimal the profitability of

245
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,940
companies sub-optimal and so it's really

246
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:42,958
important to strike that balance now my

247
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,000
models can predict at any given stage

248
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,159
how much Supply you need to support the

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,620
demand and support the rent so you don't

250
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:53,219
need to supply all of this Supply

251
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,039
immediately you have to just you know

252
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,200
grow as the market grows evolve as the

253
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,838
market evolves

254
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,019
and so and I don't think there's ever

255
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,720
been projections and requirements uh

256
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:10,740
presented on the German Market

257
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:13,920
especially going out to 2025 2030 so you

258
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,980
know this is some you know revolutionary

259
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,659
data right now and so we're going to be

260
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,899
refining this as we get more and more

261
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,899
data

262
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:27,199
so key considerations for

263
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,059
German regulatory

264
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,019
access and price is key I can't stress

265
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:35,338
that enough

266
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:38,480
uh and collecting and Publishing data is

267
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:41,519
also very very important

268
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,639
often Regulators don't know much about

269
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,399
their money

270
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,519
that's behind firewalls

271
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,379
of good businesses

272
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,200
so the more data that can be provided to

273
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,939
the market the better because it helps

274
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,980
shape policy and help shape business

275
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,380
decisions

276
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,200
um and it's important to remain flexible

277
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,958
from a regulatory perspective because

278
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,200
there's a lot of unknowns as these

279
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,059
deployments take place and so

280
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,278
understanding what you know and what you

281
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:17,159
don't know is really critical and being

282
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,200
flexible enough to say okay this is a

283
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,419
working let's change it

284
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,339
um I think Bob mentioned about the

285
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,620
regulatory that you can change things

286
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,380
quickly and I think that's what will

287
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,539
happen in the German Market

288
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,500
um for a period of four or five years

289
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:33,500
after that

290
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,220
um and I mentioned the importance of

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,059
gradual Supply

292
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,899
um and I think that the model where they

293
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:48,479
the Germany allowed for imports that

294
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:52,198
they had some basic domestic Supply and

295
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,539
then supplemented that uh with Imports I

296
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,919
think that's a good model

297
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,899
um there just needs to be a better

298
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,159
balance between domestic production and

299
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,159
imports

300
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,559
I mean keep in mind that for Regulators

301
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,740
that there's an emboldened Melissa

302
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,299
market and so they already have the you

303
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,820
know they're already ahead in the game

304
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:14,958
relative to what's going on in terms of

305
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,959
regulatory deployment

306
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,639
um and so for those that are in the

307
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,698
industry education and communication are

308
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,919
really key uh constant Communications

309
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:27,419
with Regulators is helpful for them

310
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,860
because they don't know how to regulate

311
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,838
this so we've never been doing it before

312
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,220
they may have done it on a small scale

313
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,040
with medical but that delegates is a

314
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:42,180
different piece to say the music

315
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:44,578
um and as a business operator a set

316
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,219
realistic expectations with their

317
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:49,620
business don't think that you're going

318
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,720
to get 10 of the money to the 20 of the

319
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,560
market when it's more realistic to only

320
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,899
say get two and know your cost structure

321
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,778
uh Bob and others mentioned how there's

322
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,720
going to be price declines as the market

323
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:06,120
for tourism becomes more saturated we're

324
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,860
seeing this in every Market

325
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,679
um what we're also seeing is a high

326
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,879
level of business failures in markets

327
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,419
that

328
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,698
um where they get over extended in their

329
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:22,259
cost structures turned upside down

330
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:25,259
relative to the market price and so it's

331
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:27,838
really important to be to understand the

332
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,179
cost structure understand where the

333
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,899
price is and where it's going you make

334
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:36,539
informed decisions on that and nowhere

335
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,179
when and where you have to get out if

336
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,099
you can't support your business because

337
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,439
prices are declined so much then it's

338
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,379
important to know that too and to make

339
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,100
that tough decision

340
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:53,338
and then it's important also to uh at

341
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,860
Global it's a local issue it's cannabis

342
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,259
is generally a very emotional issue

343
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,500
um it's important to act local but it's

344
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,899
also important to think globally now you

345
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,179
know five cents a gram in Thailand I've

346
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,940
seen instances where it's opinion Ram

347
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:11,099
I've seen wholesale prices in South

348
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,920
America and opinion around in the United

349
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,740
States production costs are 25 to 50

350
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,139
cents a gram so there's this competitive

351
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,500
disadvantage in the United States and it

352
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:26,579
could be very well in Germany as well

353
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,919
but so it's important to understand the

354
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:31,319
role of competition on the global scale

355
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,719
when you're operating locally and just

356
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,320
be cognizant of that so that you're not

357
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,320
surprised

358
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,240
um we've talked a little bit about him

359
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,698
um I presented some of this data before

360
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,778
on the hemp site

361
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:51,719
uh hemp is a pretty amazing industry in

362
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:54,480
and of itself and it's actually larger

363
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,360
by our calculations than the global

364
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,060
cannabis Market

365
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,879
in this example up here there's the

366
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:05,879
global demand total adjustable marketing

367
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,179
around 250 million dollars for cannabis

368
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,280
but just in 10 product categories taking

369
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,400
minimal market share

370
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:18,660
for him this is a 350 billion dollar

371
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,579
market and so and that's just those are

372
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,740
reasonable assumptions there's already a

373
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:25,078
presence in automotive there's already a

374
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,679
presence in Plastics there's already a

375
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,178
presence and animal feed and these these

376
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,320
industries are expected to grow

377
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:38,720
exponentially over the next decade so

378
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:41,759
um I think in some countries

379
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,720
hemp is viewed as a competitor to

380
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:50,240
cannabis but I see it more as a partner

381
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:54,179
or a compliment to a higher THC cannabis

382
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,339
and especially when it comes to the ESG

383
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,179
side of things environmental social and

384
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:02,399
governance on the environmental side

385
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:04,320
cannabis is a real dirty industry but

386
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,019
there's a lot of plastics a lot of

387
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:11,038
energy consumption and light and so him

388
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:13,879
can help complement and support the

389
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:16,079
higher THC cannabis industry by

390
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,960
providing environmentally friendly

391
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:22,439
products to help bring those products to

392
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,720
Market Plastics is a is one prime

393
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,640
example

394
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,819
um and there's all sorts of demand I

395
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,460
don't need to belabor the point but

396
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:35,819
um you know there's big Industries in

397
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,538
hemp and it's a compliment to hire THC

398
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:41,339
cannabis so in terms of predictions

399
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:43,440
um Germany is one of the first major

400
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:46,379
markets

401
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,380
um out of the gates here but it's that's

402
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,260
additional acceleration of legalization

403
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,820
throughout the EU and Beyond

404
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:57,359
um look for a spike I mentioned this

405
00:18:53,819 --> 00:19:00,480
about piano tourism it'll be a novel

406
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:03,899
um industry it'll be a novelty to go to

407
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,000
Germany to buy adult use but eventually

408
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,700
that will Decline and that will go away

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,700
as more and more countries deploy their

410
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,519
legal systems as well and prices will

411
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,480
remain high at the start mainly driven

412
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,700
by lack of access and under Supply but

413
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,240
prices will eventually normalize and

414
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,160
Decline and so

415
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,319
the normalization I think is something

416
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,980
that people really need to build into

417
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,819
their business models

418
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,579
so

419
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:39,119
um I think you know that's

420
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:41,939
about it I mean you know

421
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,219
I think the key message here is it's a

422
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,179
exciting opportunity

423
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:50,220
but businesses need to be disciplined

424
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:52,380
Regulators need to be disciplined there

425
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,538
needs to be an understanding not only of

426
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,780
the demand but the supply as well and

427
00:19:54,538 --> 00:20:01,679
plan accordingly and if

428
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:04,740
and it's not an easy nut to crack it's a

429
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,019
very difficult process to go through but

430
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:11,400
eventually there's plenty of opportunity

431
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:14,579
for successes not only in Germany but

432
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,200
throughout the EU and Beyond so just

433
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,720
wanted to say thank you for this

434
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,759
opportunity to speak today there's some

435
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,120
data here for you we're happy to share

436
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:27,740
it and I'll take any questions if

437
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,739
they're let's hear it for both way

438
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,298
s

439
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,819
[Applause]

440
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:40,980
anybody

441
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:43,259
someone's got to have a question

442
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,919
no how do you think Bayern Munich is

443
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,919
going to do this year

444
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,640
that's one upstairs

445
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:01,500
[Applause]

446
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:04,500
is there talking about the potential

447
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,900
markets what is the reason that Italy

448
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,359
like with last people does have such

449
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,440
more potential than for example France

450
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,639
of Germany

451
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,798
yeah so the question is why is Italy so

452
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,440
much larger than some of the more

453
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,960
populated countries and it comes down to

454
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,659
usage rates so

455
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,880
um based upon the UN numbers and others

456
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,640
there's a higher percentage rate then

457
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,260
there's more and more consumption and so

458
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,259
that's what drives the large Market

459
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,159
but one thing to note is that these are

460
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,259
pretty conservative numbers they come

461
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,559
from the U.N they come from the EU

462
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:45,538
through some of those studies and but I

463
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,460
think that they're underreported so I

464
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:50,158
think that this would be a good Baseline

465
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:54,058
to go by but the market is actually

466
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,280
substantially larger and and the demand

467
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:59,220
and consumption patterns are uniform

468
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,798
from not only state to state but the

469
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,779
continent to continent and I'm seeing

470
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,779
this especially out of some recently

471
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:11,099
published data at Uruguay where you know

472
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:13,980
31 of adults have used cannabis in the

473
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,959
past year now this is well in access to

474
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,579
what's being imported by the UN so I

475
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,640
think like I said

476
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:22,918
the uh the amount of consumption and the

477
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,320
amount of Supply here is very very

478
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,038
conservative relative to actually what's

479
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,038
going on in America

480
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:35,460
I don't need the mic

481
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:38,399
with what experience we have to learn

482
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,038
from from other countries what is one

483
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,679
hope that you have for Germany to

484
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,500
improve the process here

485
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,400
so the question is uh

486
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,460
what is the one hope that

487
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,919
Germany has for that would spell success

488
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,440
in in the deployment yeah what do you

489
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,340
think Germans can do better

490
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,500
um well

491
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:03,959
I think they're

492
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,980
they've done a reasonable job in terms

493
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,058
of deploying uh their medical program

494
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,000
um but

495
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:14,399
where they have the opportunity now to

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,119
build the infrastructure from the supply

497
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,159
all the way up most countries build

498
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:23,639
their models and their regulatory

499
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,400
structures on the top down regular their

500
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,559
retail and the taxes and all that and

501
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,798
then they go oh yeah now we need to

502
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,859
supply the market I think Germany sets

503
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,259
up the market to to where they

504
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:39,959
our common sense of the supply and a

505
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:42,419
pair of the supply then because that

506
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,460
takes the longest then from there

507
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:47,159
they'll set themselves up for success

508
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,200
and they can maximize the revenues they

509
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,679
can support the businesses I didn't even

510
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,880
talk about job creation but I think that

511
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,880
it all starts with the plan

512
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,940
it's a good question

513
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:07,410
all right that's fantastic

514
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:07,409
