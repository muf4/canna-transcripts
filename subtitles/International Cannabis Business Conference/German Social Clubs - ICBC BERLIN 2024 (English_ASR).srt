to talk about this topic and uh first

100
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,680
things first let's find out you know

101
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,759
what are the rules because I always say

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,560
we can't figure out how to use the rules

103
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,360
properly if we don't know what they are

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,360
so maybe Margaret if you want to kick us

105
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,759
off and uh tell us what are the rules

106
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,520
for Social Clubs and then we can figure

107
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,600
out how we can make some money in a way

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,240
where you're not allowed to make any

109
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,520
money okay exactly

110
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,400
yeah um so yeah it's all new uh the

111
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:42,439
Social Clubs um you can only start them

112
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,799
in first of July so we only have we have

113
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,160
we don't really know what exactly we

114
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,319
need to do we only have the law so far

115
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,400
and there to first of all you need to

116
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,719
have an

117
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,719
association and uh the board members and

118
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,199
the representatives all need to have

119
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,880
their residency in Germany so um it

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,879
doesn't work if you live abroad all the

121
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,759
members of the social club also need to

122
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:10,680
have their residency in Germany only 500

123
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:14,000
members are um allowed per Social

124
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,360
Club um the board members have need to

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,240
have a um don't they don't have they are

126
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,000
not allowed to have a criminal record um

127
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,400
so they need some kind of certificate of

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,959
Good Conduct um then the other important

129
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:31,679
thing to know is only the members of the

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,279
social club are allowed to deal to

131
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,120
handle the growth so they they do the

132
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,758
growing process and and they give it to

133
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:47,280
the other members so you cannot hire

134
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:50,120
some external uh guy to do that um apart

135
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,279
from everything apart from dealing with

136
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,240
the uh with the Cannabis itself with a

137
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,679
plant you can hire someone for cleaning

138
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,639
or security or administrative processes

139
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,160
so

140
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:09,680
um you need an um So-Cal

141
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,800
prev that some kind of expert some they

142
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,800
actually need to go through some

143
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,319
education so they know um interesting

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,038
yeah yeah it's you need some some of

145
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,759

allowed because they're solventless uh

167
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,919
do we know anything else about other

168
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,120
products uh that that are going to be

169
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,159
allowed no that's exactly it the

170
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,000
Cannabis and the hash the raisins and

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,720
also clones and um yeah Clon and no

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,560
consumption from what I understand uh oh

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,479
yeah that's important I totally forgot

174
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,120
about that so it's we call them Social

175
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:39,519
Club but actually it's not so social

176
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,680
there um yes it's kind of a antisocial

177
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,639
social all social there uh you're not

178
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,519
allowed to consume it there uh you only

179
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,560
allow to consume it 100 m away from the

180
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,439
um from the club

181
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,759
itself

182
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:59,959
um so yeah it's it's it's not comparable

183
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,080
to the system we had

184
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,598
right and and you have to actually roll

185
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,519
your own joints which is unfortunate cuz

186
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,878
T's machine would have really come in

187
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,878
handy

188
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:12,439
there about that that's interesting

189
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,560
though to and also to to I wanted to add

190
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:18,038
um it's a little bit confused for the

191
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,959
most people that since the 1 of April we

192
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,038
have this kind of legalization I don't

193
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,158
like to call it legalization part

194
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,158
decriminalization and everybody ask me

195
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:27,800
yeah and now we can open up a club now

196
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,399
we can get our weed from the club this

197
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,320
is not how it works you can uh the clubs

198
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,799
can apply from 1 of July for the license

199
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,320
and this will also take some time so

200
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,439
even there are other people think okay

201
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,039
first of July all the clubs will start

202
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,200
no first of July you can apply and this

203
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:47,879
will take let's say three months so

204
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,640
first of October you can start with the

205
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,919
with your grow so that means uh if it

206
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,799
goes through if it goes through maybe it

207
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,559
takes a bit longer butties in the Lord

208
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,199
says they can take three months to

209
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,518
answer to your request

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,200
that's why I I I say to to everybody

211
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,519
right now I I don't see it realistically

212
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,399
that uh the clubs will hand out weed to

213
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,759
the members in

214
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,879
2024 because from the timing it doesn't

215
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,399
work it has to be go really uh um on the

216
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,240
best way possible to have product uh

217
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,120
available in the club's end of the year

218
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,639
and I don't see that and and that that

219
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,600
brings up a really important question

220
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,439
like how many clubs do we expect in the

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,759
first year like we did the math

222
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
yesterday Bo Whitney was kind of doing

223
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,360
an analysis of how many clubs he expects

224
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,159
he's quite conservative with a low

225
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,278
number but with so many people using

226
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,759
cannabis in Germany we thought we would

227
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:40,838
have a ton of Social Clubs but now with

228
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,519
all these challenges and and obstacles

229
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,959
can anyone throw out some estimates of

230
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,959
what what we think there might be I

231
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,319
would thinking in the beginning we it

232
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,319
will be like a wild wild west R in the

233
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,680
next couple of months and I would say a

234
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,879
lot of people uh will try to open up uh

235
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,879
grow clubs or cannabis clubs let's call

236
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,838
the Cannabis bu clubs but then there we

237
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:04,799
will see that not uh that easy to run a

238
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,640
successful cannabis clubs and um I would

239
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,319
say um we will see a lot of like

240
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,278
activism clubs or friendship clubs and

241
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,879
then of on the other hand we will also

242
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,958
see some professional running clubs and

243
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,679
I think in the next two or three years

244
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,000
we will have up to 2,000 between two and

245
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,639
3,000 professional running clubs that's

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
the more interesting clubs for me uh

247
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,000
addition to that we will have all kind

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,440
of uh variation of of clubs I would

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,720
would say but um I would say maybe we

250
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,440
have 10,000 clubs in within the next two

251
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,639
years wow that's that's very bullish if

252
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,839
you but if you look into like the the H

253
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,399
Cup study they they say there are uh uh

254
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,839
up to 4 million people who consume

255
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,240
cannabis and then when you look like the

256
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,920
heavy consumers like uh I don't have the

257
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,759
the numbers correctly in my mind but

258
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,278
it's about 800 to 900,000 heavy users

259
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,399
and then you have another additional

260
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,600
half a million uh frequen users that's

261
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,278
up to 1 3 million users that's the the

262
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,879
most interesting cannabis users for me

263
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,000
may i' just like to add something uh in

264
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:13,120
the law It also says in that respect

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,200
that the states the provinces in Germany

266
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:21,519
are allowed to restrict it so one Club

267
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:23,600
per 6,000 residents so if they let's see

268
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,959
if they want to but there might might be

269
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,000
a restriction in some states I I just

270
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,479
have that question so it's only Germans

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,120
that will be allowed to have oh you

272
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,959
don't have to be German but your your

273
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,360
you have your home needs to be in

274
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,239
Germany your so your home need so so

275
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,720
tourists won't be able to go and partake

276
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
that's so that's also different than

277
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,759
Spain right I wonder what kind of proof

278
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,480
they're going to require uh to to do

279
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,078
this like one thing I kind of have to

280
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,320
agree with Stefan in terms of I think

281
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,799
there's going to be a lot more clubs

282
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,000
than people are thinking because uh what

283
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,278
I learned coming here to Berlin so many

284
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,360
times is it's very hard to get cannabis

285
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,600
in Germany uh I know maybe if if you

286
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,000
know somebody it might be easy but I can

287
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,278
tell you as a tourist I've traveled

288
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,759
around the whole world I don't think

289
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,278
I've had more difficulty getting

290
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,919
cannabis at a Cannabis Conference than

291
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,759
Germany so I think people are

292
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,240
underestimating uh that part of it uh I

293
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,159
think there will be a lot more and then

294
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,360
the medical system which is still quite

295
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,278
challenging also has challenges where

296
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,440
the stigma is still real doctors are

297
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,120
still not on board uh people are worried

298
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,639
about it being on their medical record

299
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,078
so I actually think people will be using

300
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,399
these clubs considerably and I agree we

301
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,599
also need to stop calling them social

302
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,278
clubs until they can be social we have I

303
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,360
think they're called growing clubs or

304
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,720
growing associations right right so

305
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,039
Association so we're going to start

306
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,959
changing that uh after this now

307
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,679
something else interesting that came up

308
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,559
uh is also much like Canada even though

309
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,879
we're federally legal every province has

310
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,039
their own interesting way of

311
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,120
legalization and we're seeing that now

312
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,599
here in Germany as well uh that you know

313
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,198
this province might be more liberal and

314
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,159
open-minded to these clubs but other

315
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,120
provinces not so much uh we were talking

316
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,480
about that backstage you want to kind of

317
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,600
touch on what have you seen Stefan and

318
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,199
then maybe we'll yeah we we saw it all

319
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,639
when the the law passed through the the

320
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:11,519
second chamber like the day before with

321
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,759
this uh protocol notice uh and this in

322
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,440
my opinion this gives uh the provinces

323
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:21,120
some room to how they interpretate that

324
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
some provinces will say we don't uh mind

325
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,639
what would they say because it's not in

326
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,720
the law others provinces like Bavaria

327
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,278
will say uh we make it even harder for

328
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
clubs because there will come some

329
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,600
changes in the near near future and like

330
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,759
uh bigger Solutions like like like our

331
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,320
Solutions we we we provide like a kind

332
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,559
of grow up uh in this one of this

333
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,879
protocol notice that they try to avoid

334
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,919
uh uh professional growth that they

335
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,838
really think that's a good idea to put

336
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,719
everything in amateur hands and produce

337
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,440
high quality of U product that's a

338
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,519
interest interesting way of thinking

339
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,880
they think it's going to be safe by

340
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,399
letting some amateurs do it uh I don't

341
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,559
know that's from our experience in

342
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,639
Canada we had designated Growers so I

343
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,319
had a ability to use cannabis I couldn't

344
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,839
grow myself I would let someone grow for

345
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,240
me but that was usually not very good

346
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,759
and you know people were waiting for

347
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,639
legalization to happen so I wonder how

348
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,519
that's going to kind of change things uh

349
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,360
any any other thoughts on the provinces

350
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,959
uh you agree with that well I guess

351
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,839
Bavaria will be very strict about

352
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:25,399
everything right um as I said the the

353
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:29,399
con consumption is not allowed in nearby

354
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:33,519
um uh schools so kindergartens and there

355
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,480
must not inside or 100 meters away so

356
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,839
after the law passed uh in Bavaria they

357
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,480
they build their n sh what's it in

358
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,160
English something for kids to play on

359
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,720
near one of yeah someone was talking

360
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:48,519
about that oh my gosh so they are not

361
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,199
cannot consume it there now I I wonder

362
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,639
you know I I always teach my kids to

363
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,159
whenever you wonder something follow the

364
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,720
money and I wonder how much certain

365
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,278
provinces who make so much money on

366
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,680
alcohol are really concerned that their

367
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:01,240
alcohol money go goes down cuz we've

368
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,879
seen with legalization alcohol

369
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,120
consumption goes down as much as 30% so

370
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,000
I wonder if a lot of these people are

371
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,839
looking at that and wondering hm we make

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,600
this much money on alcohol now that

373
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,320
cannabis is introduced we're going to be

374
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,920
losing a lot of that revenue and it's

375
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,839
definitely not going to be made up by

376
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,599
these clubs that are nonprofit so I

377
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,519
wonder if that's a factor sure but this

378
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,360
was affect the whole uh last two years I

379
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,639
would say because the alcohol Lobby try

380
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,240
to do everything to avoid this kind of

381
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,600
law I think not only did alcoholic also

382
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,919
the pharmaceutical uh sector try to make

383
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,680
it harder for for us that uh it's harder

384
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,000
to get recreational Cannabis everybody

385
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,039
can grow their own medicine and the

386
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,278
backyard I I don't think big farm like

387
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,958
that no and alcohol doesn't like that

388
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:47,600
either for sure uh what about other uh

389
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,119
countries we know that Spain uh we were

390
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,360
just in Barcelona for ICBC boy is that a

391
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,600
lot of fun I mean it's so crazy to think

392
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,120
Spain does not have legalization but it

393
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,800
actually has one of the greatest places

394
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,759
of legal cannabis I've ever seen in my

395
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,519
life life and they tell me oh we don't

396
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,360
have legalization I'm like I come from a

397
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,240
land of legalization and we don't even

398
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,800
have jars of flour we don't have places

399
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,759
to consume you guys have more

400
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,919
legalization than us and you don't even

401
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,120
have legalization maybe touch on I mean

402
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,879
you you own some clubs in Spain you know

403
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,959
just high level for the people in the

404
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,720
audience that might not know Spain Malta

405
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,318
what what does that look like Spain is

406
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,720
is all operating like in a in a big gray

407
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,799
Zone I would say but uh you mentioned I

408
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,759
I like the the the Spanish uh cannabis

409
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,439
club model because there we really have

410
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,240
a social life and there I think this is

411
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,279
like a idial place to be you know you

412
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,000
can uh uh drink your beer you can drink

413
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,240
your wine you can smoke your joint and

414
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,519
watch a football game with all your

415
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,120
friends and it's not like even not like

416
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,679
in in in the Netherlands where you're

417
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,399
not allowed to drink beer and and smoke

418
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,399
a joint in the same local in Spain uh

419
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,278
because we are in a gray area you can do

420
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,600
it um but the the the downsides and

421
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,439
Spain is you cannot uh grow legally it's

422
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,560
more or less the same than like in the

423
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,560
Netherlands

424
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,638
you have to in the end a lot of clubs

425
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,918
buy their stuff on the black market

426
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,318
because if they try to set up legal grow

427
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,520
they get busted and and the clubs get

428
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:14,240
busted anyways uh once or twice a year

429
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,959
this in your business calculations the

430
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,838
police will come once or twice a year

431
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,519
and take all they can get their hands on

432
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,599
they take all the weed all the money and

433
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,879
then you open up next day with uh Fresh

434
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,399
Products on the Shelf wow and is is

435
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,160
Malta the the same kind of similar of

436
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,360
what is happening in Spain no I don't

437
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,240
think the malta is is more stricter more

438
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:37,119
like also in in the German direction but

439
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,519
and I think it it took them in Malta

440
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,839
over two years to uh get the first

441
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:46,000
license it just happened like few months

442
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:47,798
ago so um I think we and Malta is very

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,038
small so we don't have the the same

444
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,839
experience there and I think it's would

445
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,119
be interesting in Germany is like one of

446
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,279
the biggest countries or the biggest

447
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,158
country in Europe uh what we will do

448
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:00,119
here in in Germany and um yeah AG be

449
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,840
very interesting of all this kind

450
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,119
different kind of business models uh

451
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,038
that came up and then we will see who

452
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,199
find the best loopholes I would say

453
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:11,839
because uh I would say we we are totally

454
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,519
happy that we have now cannabis law for

455
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,959
me personally I think this is one of the

456
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,679
baddest law I could imagine but it's

457
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,759
still the best Canabis law because we

458
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,038
have one yeah the most countries doesn't

459
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,240
have any so we can work with it so and

460
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,798
I'm quite fine that there are a lot of

461
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,960
obstacles in the way and we can operate

462
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,119
with obstacles but when it's uh too easy

463
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,519
then big farmer jump in Big Money cames

464
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:37,319
and uh companies lie like my myself uh

465
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,240
we have not that room to operate anymore

466
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,480
you know and no we are good in finding

467
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Solutions and uh we will find solution

468
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,200
for every like obstacle that's in our

469
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,679
way and uh did it like the last years

470
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,120
also in in in Spain it's still the same

471
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,400
yes so we'll find a way absolutely and

472
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:54,038
Tark I know you like to visit these uh

473
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,519
clubs uh what are some of the things you

474
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:57,759
really like about going to these clubs

475
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,279
and and what do you think about that

476
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,079
yeah um I talking with stepan and Stefan

477
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,839
was uh you know has more experience in

478
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,759
actually running the clubs but just me

479
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,158
as a consumer when I was in Spain for

480
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:12,720
ICBC Barcelona um there is a variation

481
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:15,720
in the uh comfort and the uh Hospitality

482
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,159
of these clubs per se so um yeah like

483
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,919
when you're talking about hanging out

484
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,280
having a drink watching some football

485
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,480
with friends that sounds ideal um even

486
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,200
in California you just have some

487
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,360
dingy uh dispensaries where you walk in

488
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,120
and you feel like you're breaking the

489
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:34,079
law even though it's legal so um my

490
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,599
advice for all the Social Clubs is just

491
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:40,000
try to make it as welcoming as possible

492
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:42,199
um just changing that stigma um the

493
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,440
again the dispensaries in California you

494
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,960
know you have grandmothers and

495
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,360
grandfathers that go into them and they

496
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,759
won't go into the ones that are super

497
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:51,558
dark and scary but if it's bright lights

498
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:55,158
and colors and just kind of normalizing

499
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:57,279
I think that's a important part for even

500
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,559
the uh officials in government to see

501
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,480
that this isn't some you know Shady drug

502
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,000
business this is just normal just like

503
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,640
going to grab a beer so right and and

504
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
you know it's very important to be very

505
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,640
welcoming I I actually saw the my one of

506
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,519
my favorite clubs in Barcelona choco

507
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
Cedric is here from there and it's very

508
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,558
bright and welcoming and it was nice to

509
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,319
see locals there and tourists

510
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,918
intermingling kind of getting to know I

511
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,038
almost feel bad that you know the locals

512
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,600
come we're like well what's with these

513
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,879
lineups it's spannabis of course that's

514
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,678
that's why but uh we have to you know

515
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,960
when we think about why these clubs are

516
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,120
like in Canada people are like why are

517
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,840
they doing it like this they're so

518
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,959
confused one thing I always have to

519
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,879
explain to them is that these are ways

520
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,759
of getting around these European Union

521
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,760
conventions uh you know the European

522
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,558
Union and the UN they're very strict

523
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,079
although I got to point out uh our prime

524
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,079
minister in Canada Justin Trudeau who's

525
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,199
not very popular uh in most of the

526
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,319
people that I know but uh he did say

527
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,679
something the other day that was

528
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,399
important he said that the United

529
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,120
Nations have not even said a word about

530
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,320
our legalization cuz everyone was like

531
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,000
you know what happened everyone was all

532
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,639
scared that you know we legalized and

533
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,079
the UN was going to to come after us and

534
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,600
he suggested that we never even got any

535
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,918
letters uh now it came out that

536
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,839
apparently a letter was sent he must

537
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,280
have just shredded it and didn't read it

538
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,558
but uh I think it's important to know

539
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,319
and maybe Margaret if you can kind of

540
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:14,960
touch on or or someone else you know why

541
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,439
are the clubs the way we do it and and

542
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,000
how is the EU how is this kind of around

543
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,480
the EU and and kind of how is it

544
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,159
skirting around yeah yeah that's a good

545
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:30,278
question um so actually uh back then

546
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:35,000
when uh the our uh uh traffic Coalition

547
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:37,679
um yes came into uh uh here into Germany

548
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,079
they actually had a different view of

549
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,038
how to legalize cannabis they were

550
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:46,918
thinking maybe bit like Canada thinking

551
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:50,359
about chains their distribution chains

552
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,759
uh commercial Supply chains but then so

553
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:55,000
that's that's what they said when uh

554
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,759
when they all started but then um they

555
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,400
looked into the law and found uh as you

556
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,359
said the you conventions they're three

557
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,400
and they went back to the uh European

558
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,479
Union the commission and and try to find

559
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,080
their way they were very critical there

560
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,960
and they didn't approve it so in the end

561
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:19,158
what what we have now is a compromise so

562
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,798
we we have a partly legalization as you

563
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,880
already said uh you can do it at home

564
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:27,519
and with a social clubs and in the

565
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,840
future but it's already in the law this

566
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:33,839
is a plan the second pillar they say

567
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:37,359
there they will have models they will

568
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,158
try to establish these Supply chains and

569
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,119
they will make research with them and

570
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,679
they I think yeah that's that's what we

571
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,678
plan we don't know anything about that

572
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,640
yet it's just there in the law that they

573
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:51,840
are planning that but we have no details

574
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,240
on that and um so this is uh first

575
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,359
pillar the the very start and that

576
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,519
that's within the laws how we can do it

577
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,918
and it's interesting swi land uh you

578
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,960
know they were one of the only ones who

579
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:03,240
kind of did a different thing they have

580
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,919
these pilot projects that are also

581
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,200
broken up by provinces uh you know I

582
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,600
wonder if they're also going to go the

583
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
social club way I I don't know if

584
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,199
they've kind of been speaking about it

585
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,759
but it'll be interesting to see if at

586
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,960
the end of all these uh consultations if

587
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,720
they're going to go that way too I don't

588
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
know if you have any thoughts on

589
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,319
Switzerland and then we're going to open

590
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,439
up to some questions early because I

591
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,200
feel like there'll be some questions but

592
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,278
we have more questions if we if you

593
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,919
don't so think about that Stefan what do

594
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:28,159
you think about I would say now uh

595
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,600
everybody at least in Europe uh looks uh

596
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,679
about us about Germany how how we will

597
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,798
do it and we will do some some mistakes

598
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,600
for for sure and um they will look at us

599
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:40,200
how we we handle that and um yeah it's

600
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,558
an in theory the clubs has to be

601
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,360
nonprofit and uh but there are ways to

602
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:47,038
to make profit with clubs even when they

603
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,719
are nonprofit but you have to be

604
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,919
creative you

605
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,720
know yeah would you recommend anybody in

606
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,640
the audience who's considering opening a

607
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,720
social club or a consumption Club in

608
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,480
Germany do you think now is a good time

609
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,120
to jump in while it's early or it's

610
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:08,360
still too many loopholes that you don't

611
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,038
really know yet the depends uh um how

612
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,918
how deep are you in the in the topic you

613
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:14,879
have to know the the the law quite good

614
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,038
you have to already have uh some

615
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,440
loopholes in mind who you work with and

616
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,519
uh I would wouldn't say uh it's it's a

617
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,440
good idea or a bad idea I would say even

618
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:27,519
if you start in in half a year or a year

619
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,159
you can be successful but um if you have

620
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,440
already your business model in mind uh

621
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,840
start now it's uh right yeah so there

622
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,278
are ways though still to even though

623
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:38,398
it's nonprofit like you said what you

624
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,319
kind of do in Spain even with the 100

625
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:42,479
meters you cannot have you not you

626
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,759
cannot consume within 100 meters yeah in

627
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,640
public but it means when when you have

628
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:50,200
like a a nonpublic like let's say

629
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,679
restaurant or smoking restaurant next to

630
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,519
a cannabis club you can consume there

631
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,960
because this is not public right so you

632
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,639
can there you have to look out about the

633
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,519
non-smoking regulation in all parts of

634
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,880
the country I think but you have this

635
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:09,079
cigar clubs this gentleman clubs and all

636
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,278
that there you can smoke cigars there

637
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,119
you can also smoke cannabis now you know

638
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,359
and in Bavaria I know they have a

639
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,000
stricter regulation when it comes to uh

640
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,879
uh smoking uh uh clubs there would be

641
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,720
more hard but uh this is we have we will

642
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,640
see a real yeah VOR priority of the

643
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,558
landscape in in in Germany you in some

644
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,960
provinces you can do a lot more more

645
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,879
than others in in all kind of not just

646
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,000
for the clubs also for consumption I

647
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,278
think it's really important to have to

648
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,798
have like uh consumption rooms for for

649
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,398
the for the members because this is what

650
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,720
I like in Spain the people consume there

651
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,678
and uh my employes that they see if

652
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,600
somebody uh has a problem with the

653
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,759
consumption then they can start to speak

654
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:56,319
about it uh we we have all this

655
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,558
regulations that we have this uh um drug

656
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,798
police officer in this clubs but the

657
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,398
people doesn't smoke there so you don't

658
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,278
see who has a problem you know yeah and

659
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:07,158
I and people ask like should I get into

660
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,038
this I say do you love cannabis and do

661
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,000
you have a stomach for the stress of

662
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,519
being in a new regulatory environment

663
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,960
which of course the Cannabis can help

664
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,038
with

665
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,600
and and and and by the way uh you know

666
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,319
people talk about how it's a nonprofit

667
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,079
We like to joke in Canada that all our

668
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,200
businesses in Canada are nonprofit

669
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,199
because uh although I do see someone in

670
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,000
the audience who does pretty well but uh

671
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,600
yes in general most of our businesses

672
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,159
are are nonprofit unfortunately the only

673
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,240
person that really makes a lot of profit

674
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
in Canada is the government but we won't

675
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,120
get into that that's a different topic

676
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,640
for another day now we definitely have

677
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,239
some more questions for the audience but

678
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,679
I I feel like people out there want some

679
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,000
questions uh does anyone have any

680
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,720
questions and gu you want to ask and

681
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,880
then if not I have more sure does anyone

682
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,558
have any questions yeah I I had a

683
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,640
feeling a Hot Topic with lots of

684
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,918
questions um you said that um people uh

685
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,679
to join a club you cannot have a

686
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,320
criminal record um not when you join the

687
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,038
club when you are board member of the

688

brief you're good you're good hello uh

692
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,639
thank you uh my question is for

693
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,240
everybody uh here we are um talking

694
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,960
about the Canabis clubs in Spain that's

695
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,440
a base for these Canabis clubs in in

696
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,000
Germany but we are forgetting here in

697
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,679
Germany not only the Shan that that's

698
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
very important but what you do with the

699
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,278
social because you educate people

700
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,919
throughout this Canabis class when

701
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:40,159
people stay there consume there they can

702
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,240
also stop quitting

703
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:47,039
smoking um the association can advise

704
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,240
them to do this also uh Association can

705
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,200
be the best way to do campaigns in the

706
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,759
prevention in the risk of use of

707
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,919
cannabis oh yeah we age and Germany is

708
00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:00,798
not doing it thank you no I think

709
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,200
everyone here agrees but you know this

710
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,319
is a step in the right direction towards

711
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,519
and and this is federally legal where in

712
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,839
Spain as great as that is it's still

713
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,880
they buy the product from the elicit

714
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:13,720
market and you know it's kind of a mix

715
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,320
would be the right answer I think yes go

716
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,919
ahead okay hello I was wondering if

717
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,439
there any quality control requirements

718
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,000
for the Cannabis that is produced in the

719
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,640
social club that is an excellent

720
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,960
question actually if so um do you know

721
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,880
how this um testing will be organized so

722
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,159
if if is is it the responsibility of

723
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,120
governmental institutions or will thank

724
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,960
you for bringing that up I actually

725
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,119
meant to bring it up uh because yes like

726
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,278
we know that there's going to be a lot

727
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,959
of Regulatory Compliance and Reporting

728
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,200
at the club we'll need software for that

729
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,640
but what about the we all waiting for

730
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,720
this kind of informations I hopefully uh

731
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,038
until the 1 of July when we all can

732
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,079
apply for the license we we know that

733
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,599
topic uh we we speak about that uh in

734
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,119
priority to to the law um what about

735
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,519
testing and all that and it's it's it's

736
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,599
critical because the expensive though

737
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,120
it's very expensive we test each product

738
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,798
three times in Canada yeah and and you

739
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,639
know if if you have this this small Club

740
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,679
maybe they have like a special uh

741
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,240
genetic special strengths and they have

742
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,640
just yield from 100 G let's say and how

743
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,240
much from this 100 gr you want to take

744
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,240
apart for testing when you ask the

745
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,558
laboratory they said yeah I need 50 g so

746
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,519
you you give away half of your Harvest

747
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:30,720
for testing yeah for microbi it's not a

748
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,960
good idea Say it'll be in the law it

749
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,159
does say that the authorities allowed to

750
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,000
go in there and make testings but not

751
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,440
very specific I think in gu's available

752
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,960
for testing I was you took my line oh oh

753
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,159
I was going to say yes I'm available to

754
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,759
help test my rates are very reasonable

755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,360
it won't even take you 50 grams like

756
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,558
three grams oh three G that seems

757
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,479
reasonable to

758
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:55,240
me uh I have kind of a two-part question

759
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,798
um one can you kind of outline what the

760
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,399
clubs would look like here in Germany as

761
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:02,079
far as the relationship ship between the

762
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:05,038
physical location as well as the grow

763
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,558
facilities and then uh my second part

764
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,720
has to do with a point you brought up

765
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:12,200
with the um kind of having almost like a

766
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,640
separate business that would be uh a

767
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,558
place that's private where you can

768
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,799
consume cannabis on site as almost like

769
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:21,720
a sister company to the

770
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,918
collective yeah yeah that's uh uh some

771
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,360
some ideas to have like a separate

772
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,880
business for consumption room uh next to

773
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:34,599
it or something like that sure and the

774
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,679
first question that you can the where

775
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,719
you grow and where the association is

776
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,759
placed does not have to be at the same

777
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,200
spot I think that was your first

778
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,720
question yeah no okay thank you keep an

779
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,960
eye on the Lora website I'm sure

780
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,960
there'll be some more info about that

781
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,720
soon does it need to it needs to be in

782
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,558
the same state or same Province no no so

783
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,759
you can get it from anywhere and as long

784
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:59,079
as it's obviously within Germany just

785
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,240
has to be in Germany and you can produce

786
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:03,839
in one Province and your dispensary can

787
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,120
be let's be honest with the open borders

788
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,519
in Europe it's going to be very

789
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,000
interesting I mean you can literally get

790
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:09,599
in your car and drive to a different

791
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,638
country and they'll say hey where'd you

792
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,839
get it hey I'm a member of this club

793
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:14,079
it's going to be very interesting or I

794
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:16,319
have a medical prescription and I'm

795
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,678
driving to France can you get arrested

796
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,278
in France with your cannabis with your

797
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,759
medical prescription from Germany

798
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,519
anyways again different topic apologies

799
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,919
another question we're talk we talking

800
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,720
cannabis gr clubs yes I I would like to

801
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,480
know if it's possible to open Social

802
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,399
Club clubs in the form as a brand you

803
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,038
know that you can open multiple Social

804
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:35,599
Clubs in multiple cities for example

805
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:37,759
would that be possible that's a good

806
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:40,398
point can one person own multiple clubs

807
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:43,200
in theory I don't know and no person can

808
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:46,239
own a club it's it's Association the

809
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,038
association owns to do themselves and uh

810
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,759
branding and marketing is is a critical

811
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,480
topic because you are not allowed to to

812
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,319
Market at all when it comes to to to

813
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,319
cannabis so we we have to see what

814
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,879
what's uh would be possible how are

815
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:00,879
people Define your Club if you're not

816
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,080
allowed to Market do they just use the

817
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,639
force or you have that's what we have in

818
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:06,359
Canada right now we can't Market our

819
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:08,479
cannabis either technically but we find

820
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:11,278
creative ways of doing that we call it

821
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,000
education by the way sure okay so there

822
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,880
was um uh was it in Colorado there was a

823
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,679
dispensary in Colorado because you're

824
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,799
not allowed to to advertise so they

825
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,360
would advertise the uh businesses next

826
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,359
to them like hey if you want to get a

827
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,839
haircut come here it's right next door

828
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,638
to the cannabis dispensary we've seen

829
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,439
that in Canada too actually that's it's

830
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:31,558
pretty good idea and by the way on that

831
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,480
note the whole Community we also we

832
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,359
didn't touch on that uh you can't be a

833
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,880
member of multiple clubs technically but

834
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,000
I think fake ID sales are going to be

835
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,679
very popular here in Germany uh because

836
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
of that I don't think you need the fake

837
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,720
ID because you had just

838
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,638
decare that you just Member One Club the

839
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,360
government doesn't check it ah good

840
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:53,638
point very point so my question would be

841
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,158
more for Margaret I think she should

842
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,959
understand here the most about the

843
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,600
German laws and how this will work so

844
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,200
for investors now who all wait you know

845
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:05,918
to create those cannabis clubs just to

846
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,519
be kind of clear what the regulation

847
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,840
will be exact exact like line after line

848
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,798
how we can grow fertilizers you know all

849
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,759
the technique where we can invest like

850
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,079
all this money is big money we need to

851
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,558
be sure about this and when this going

852
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,879
to be sure this on July 1st do the

853
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:26,038
German government will say this and this

854
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,399
and this for the clubs exact this and

855
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,759
this you can grow that and that or my

856
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,079
lawyer said that oh we will just allow

857
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,480
this and then we will wait and then we

858
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:38,398
will catch some big facilities and then

859
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,319
we will interpretate the law and then

860
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,398
through this interpretations we're going

861
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:47,519
to find out so you know for the

862
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:49,319
interpret I see the frustration there um

863
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,440
and I feel with

864
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:55,638
you B but um actually this is quite

865
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,480
common in Germany we have the law and

866
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:00,359
how you interpret it it's not

867
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,960
in other countries like the us or UK

868
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:04,479
it's different but in Germany it's all

869
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,919
jurus Prudence so in the end it will

870
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,280
take some time things you will try it

871
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,280
out with your lawyers then it will go to

872
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,359
court and then you get a decision I'm so

873
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,679
sorry but this is how how Germany is and

874
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:19,639
then it will get more and more defined

875
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,200
and after the Through The Years you will

876
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,800
have more knowledge how how the system

877
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:28,358
works but at the beginning we have a

878
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,720
very abstract not so specific law

879
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,598
which is the case in Germany that's like

880
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,638
all our laws I guess need a good lawyer

881
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,000
is what she's saying and she knows a

882
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,599
goodw recommend but but you know it's

883
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,838
very typical very vague laws that are up

884
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,879
to interpretation is really how this is

885
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,239
done and you find the creative ways to

886
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:46,918
interpret them and then you challenge

887
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:49,319
them and that's how we build an industry

888
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,559
yeah and then you will see uh what's uh

889
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,480
will work in the north of Germany will

890
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,799
probably will not work in the south of

891
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,240
Germany so you will have slightly

892
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,640
different uh uh interpretation of the

893
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,078
law in in all the provinces the Autobon

894
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,319
is going to be busy yeah at least you

895
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:07,760
can get there fast but for all that more

896
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,519
questions we're going to go very quickly

897
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,560
okay hello I have a question um if

898
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:15,480
you're a a member of the social club you

899
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,838
have to give you private uh information

900
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,519
do you accept from expect from the

901
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,358
German police that they will have more

902
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:26,519
control like uh sitting around the the

903
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:28,799
social club and have like uh drug tests

904
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:31,079
when you drive a car uh because it stays

905
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,440
in your blood several days so a lot of

906
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,560
the the member will be afraid to give

907
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,320
their information about that I mean they

908
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:40,320
did the same now with the social club

909
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,119
like an N chall testing for drug

910
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,838
impairment while driving is a very big

911
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,519
challenge we have this in Canada you

912
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,480
can't test blood cuz it lasts so long in

913
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,480
your blood so I smoke cannabis today

914
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,440
tomorrow I drive my car we don't really

915
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,519
have a test that says you are high right

916
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,639
now I mean there's a company called

917
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,960
zentella that hases an EEG headband that

918
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:58,559
measures your brain waves and tells you

919
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
if you're high right now now but that's

920
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,119
way too complicated for a police offic

921
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,279
let's talk about clubs so

922
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,800
yeah okay I think we already cut a

923
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,440
little bit on that question regarding

924
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,160
the advertisement so the law says

925
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,240
there's a strict advertising ban on

926
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,639
cannabis but also the cannabis clubs

927
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,039
where's the law the line like what is

928
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,879
information and what is considered

929
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,000
advertisement are we allowed to have a

930
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,880
website or like where do we cut the line

931
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,760
of

932
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,119
advertising I think uh what is already

933
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,359
happening now if you just want to uh

934
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,079
provide education so we do have already

935
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:32,239
cannabis clubs in Germany and you they

936
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,880
have a website and you can provide

937
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:39,399
information on cannabis and side effects

938
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,358
but you're not allowed to promote um the

939
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,318
the

940
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:45,199
consumption so they're very also what I

941
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,920
didn't mentioned before when you give

942
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,719
out your cannabis you're not allowed to

943
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,440
Brand it it must be a neutral package it

944
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:56,039
says in the law but um yeah it's it's

945
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,240
there's not a really clear distinction

946
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,800
but this is if you're interested in this

947
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,519
topic though go pay attention to what

948
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,560
Canada's doing we have plain packaging

949
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,159
we have a lot of this boring regulations

950
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:07,599
but we find creative ways to promote

951
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,598
these products we just don't call it

952
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,039
promotion again we call it education or

953
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,838
you know we find other ways of doing it

954
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,279
so follow Canada or reach out to me I'll

955
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:16,480
give you some links to kind of give you

956
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,119
an idea of what that looks like uh some

957
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,480
when it's like up up at the top there's

958
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,720
someone waiting for a long time no no

959
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,920
okay sorry okay Sor else but we're going

960
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:28,399
to lunch you can all and it yeah we'll

961
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,559
be outside the Paul happy to answer any

962
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,400
questions I have two questions one would

963
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,000
be uh uh oh

964
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,480
Frederick does it work now okay I'd like

965
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,358
to know if you know that uh if several

966
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,960
clubs can share one production site

967
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,880
that's the first question and uh the

968
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,440
other one would be could you clarify a

969
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,880
little bit about the

970
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,880
taxation oh taxes wait they're not going

971
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,000
to tax this are they no taxes yeah I

972
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,000
would say Monex is nonprofit but it it

973
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,480
depends a little bit uh how you

974
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,559
structure your uh uh your Association

975
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,280
uh the bit and uh what was the the the

976
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:06,078
first part of the well that's your part

977
