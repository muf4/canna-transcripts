1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,179
no matter your place in the cannabis

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,919
industry you have to partner and find

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:11,399

drug policy and he's in this for the

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,660
right reasons he was instrumental in

Chris crane I'm the founder of and

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,250
president of forefront ventures which

27
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,739
encompasses four fan advisors so we

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,060
operate dispensaries operate and consult

29
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:13,938
with dispensaries across the United

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,740
States and I'll introduce my panel here

31
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:18,750
momentarily wanted it you know because

32
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,099
this is a late session and I know folks

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,640
are kind of tired and we got to compete

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,289
with 4/20 which is really unfair so I

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,920
want to run this as conversational as

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,780
possible I shameless plug alert I'm the

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,570
host of a podcast called marijuana today

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,859
we do a weekly round table discussion on

39
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,809
the week's news and politics and

40
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,390
industry so if you haven't checked it

41
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,560
out I recommend you do so but in order

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,269
to keep this a little more engaging I

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,859
want to sort of run this session podcast

44
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,989
style so I'm gonna act more like a host

45
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,000
of a discussion group and keep it really

46
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,280
really conversational so let everyone

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,009
take a quick one-minute introduction and

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,030
then we'll just jump into some questions

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,799
and hopefully have some time at the end

50
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,040

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,770
mr. Jurgen pickle isn't here I am

76
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,719
filling in for him actually and I will

77
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,310
try to do so as best as I can and hope

78
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,209
you're not too disappointed that he's

79
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,209
not speaking himself

80
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,820
thank you yeah so we are we're a German

81
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,609
company we're based in southern Germany

82
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:19,079
in a small town called tootling and

83
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:21,540
where we manufacture medical cannabis

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,330
vaporizers so the volcano for example

85
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:26,310
another example is the mighty which is

86
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,250
also medically certified both are

87
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,610
certified in Europe in Canada and in

88
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,219
Israel at the moment yes so that's

89
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,120
that's it about the company I'm the head

90
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:41,219
of marketing and also I'm the medical

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,840
device consultant so I'm the person who

92
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:49,289
is most in contact with patients with

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,670
pharmacies with you know all the stuff

94
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,219
that is really complicated right now

95
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:59,548
it's in Germany but it's really exciting

96
00:03:53,219 --> 00:04:02,159
so thank you Chris was you hi Chris

97
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,370
panca I'm the chairman and CEO of lux

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,169
Aria bioscience Corp were a publicly

99
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,079
traded company in Canada in the United

100
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:15,328
States have offices both in Canada and

101
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:19,620
the US we work on edible forms edible

102
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:21,449
and topical forms of absorption and

103
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,410
improving the characteristics of

104
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:26,810
cannabis and other drugs as well

105
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,450
to get them into your bloodstream more

106
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:33,560
predictably generally speaking more

107
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:36,259
enjoyably and much more quickly than is

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,730
otherwise possible so that's what we

109
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:40,909
built our business on we're talking to

110
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,550
companies in many countries around the

111
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,200
world about licensing our technology and

112
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:50,389
that is that is what we do and Vincent

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,860
my name is Vincent coltie co-founder of

114
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,169
show products were based out of Los

115
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,270
Angeles California we're most known for

116
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,790
our rods and tech products line of

117
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:01,159
products but we also manufacture Polly

118
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,350
masters electric now

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,230
damnation is one of our brands also and

120
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,850
show industries we like to say we're the

121
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,540
world leader and Salamis extraction

122
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,220
equipment and supplies for the industry

123
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,260
it's basically the rap on my business

124
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,530
great so we're here to talk about

125
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,029
strategic partnerships I think it's

126
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,679
fairly safe to say that in any industry

127
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,809
you're going to need partnerships you're

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,150
gonna need vendor relationships and so

129
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,579
I'll throw this out to the whole panel

130
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:31,129
how important are strategic partnerships

131
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,209
in the cannabis industry relative to any

132
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:34,399
other initiatives this is is this just

133
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,109
like another widget or being a

134
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,879
manufacturer widget or is there are

135
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,080
there unique aspects to forming

136
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,750
partnerships in this industry that you

137
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,459
all have encountered I mean I think in

138
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,889
any industry strategic partnerships are

139
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,739
definitely vital but now in the cannabis

140
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,389
industry specifically because of the

141
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,900
rapid pace that we're moving at if you

142
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:55,250
try to go at this alone in any capacity

143
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:57,229
you're gonna find it's very very tough

144
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,899
to keep up it's tough to keep up as it

145
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,129
is right now in this rapid worldwide

146
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,099
industry that we're in

147
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,629
so finding strategic alliances and

148
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,290
people that share the same vision you

149
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:13,399
view is a key role to I think success in

150
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:16,100
this industry right now III totally

151
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,159
agree and as well because of the

152
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,230
regulatory environment that's both newly

153
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,060
emerging and shifting all over the place

154
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,610
so as you as I'm sure you're aware in

155
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,889
America for example every state has

156
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,410
different rules and regulatory

157
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,529
environment which means that companies

158
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:37,590
that are trying to operate in a natural

159
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:39,329
or a quasi national format need to do so

160
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:42,929
through strategic partners in other

161
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:44,479
states cannabis if the cannabis laws in

162
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,160
the United States are such that

163
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,710
obviously it's still federally illegal

164
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,430
but even where it is legal at the state

165
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:54,899
level a corporation for example that is

166
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,209
incorporated say in the state of

167
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,519
California is not permitted to do

168
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:02,219
business in the state of Colorado it

169
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
needs to be owned and operated generally

170
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,150
speaking within each state you know

171
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,799
there are exceptions to that but

172
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:10,529
partnering is very very important for

173
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,240
the regulatory reasons it's also really

174
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:15,809
important as the industry is growing up

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,759
right before your eyes because everybody

176
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,560
everybody around the world it's not just

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,870
Germany everybody starts by selling

178
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,339
flour now that's where it starts it

179
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,410
starts with medical and starts with

180
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,339
flour but that is not where it finishes

181
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,630
it finishes with consumer products and

182
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,489
just because somebody is really good at

183
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,189
growing a plant doesn't mean they know a

184
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,310
darn thing about how to make soda pop or

185
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:41,310
chocolate bar or cookie or anything else

186
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,250
that you might want to consume so you're

187
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,899
seeing a lot of developments nationally

188
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,449
and internationally with consumer

189
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,639
products companies tobacco companies

190
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,620
everybody knows about constellation

191
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,079
brands having written a big check to a

192
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,350
Canadian company constellation of course

193
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,930
is an alcohol company so it's the the

194
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,210
partnering between the expertise levels

195
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,550
in the cannabis sector as well as in the

196
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,839
consumer products sectors that we think

197
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,150
is where you're going to see most of the

198
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,969
strategic partnering as well as to meet

199
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,709
the regional jurisdictional demands we

200
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,150
talked about we talked mean we talked

201
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,039
about the cannabis industry as if it's

202
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:20,489
an industry but really there's its

203
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,620
farming it's lab tech right and it's

204
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,300
extraction there's all sorts of facets

205
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,649
of it and it's new in the United States

206
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,819
at least in numbers in a number of

207
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:28,620
states we've required these businesses

208
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,969
to become vertically integrated and it's

209
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,930
like asking somebody to be an expert in

210
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,610
all sorts of things it's like saying

211
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,379
you're gonna open a clothing store you

212
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,340
also have to be a cotton farmer right it

213
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,840
doesn't really happen in other

214
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,280
industries and so as this develops it's

215
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,350
inevitable that you're gonna have to

216
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,549
form these types of partnerships in

217
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,690
order to be successful because it's

218
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,399
going to come down to more and more

219
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,800
specialization right nobody's going to

220
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,939
really be an expert in everything right

221
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,959
if you are you're going to be a

222
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,870
consultant you're really not gonna be an

223
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,639
operator

224
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,460
but you brought up a really good point

225
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:57,069
about the need to partner in the United

226
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,360
States at least you every state has very

227
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,120
different laws different regulations

228
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,330
it's hard to get licenses my company is

229
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,970
a multi-state operator and we can't just

230
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,680
go into a new state on our own and be a

231
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,180
carpetbagger I don't know for the

232
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,620
Europeans if you look familiar with the

233
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,789
term carpetbagger but it basically means

234
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,080
you're going in and you're trying to do

235
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:15,730
business and somebody else's turf

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,420
without having any ties to that

237
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,159
community

238
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,259
you can't win a license in most places

239
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,870
as a pure Park carpetbagger you have to

240
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,429
find a good local strategic partner that

241
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,139
understands the political environment

242
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,699
that understands the business climate or

243
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,129
you have virtually no chance of getting

244
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,020
into that market I'd be curious from the

245
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,759
panel how you've seen that apply so far

246
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,500
to Europe or this isn't a this is not a

247
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,490
state-by-state market but certainly

248
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,370
these would be country by country

249
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,539
markets and what you think for what your

250
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,700
thoughts are for businesses that are

251
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:45,009
looking to expand into Europe or start

252
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,740
in Europe and their ability to do so

253
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,939
with or without really solid local

254
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:55,480
partners in the country they're looking

255
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:57,610
to work in well okay our company is

256
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,230
ancillary so it's a little different

257
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,570
because we we don't have to deal with

258
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,680
the same legalities but being ancillary

259
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,330
it's essential for us to partner with

260
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,009
actual companies touching the cannabis

261
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,350
product because without the companies

262
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:14,289
actually touching the cannabis products

263
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,200
we can't do any development or R&amp;D or

264
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:19,360
testing on our products so to touch on

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,820
how that's worked in the States and

266
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,409
going into Europe is I think it's a it's

267
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,480
pretty much impossible like you said

268
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:28,419
even on the state level in the u.s. to

269
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,879
enter into these new markets on your own

270
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,439
but it's also even harder coming from

271
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,778
the u.s. trying to enter a European

272
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,950
market because the culture is even more

273
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:39,189
different and there's there's definitely

274
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,320
a bigger sense of nationalism here also

275
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,290
so coming in from the u.s. to the

276
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,570
European I think a good piece of advice

277
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:48,789
would be to find people that once again

278
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,220
share your vision that you have from us

279
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:56,139
or the markets you're in and follow them

280
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,899
through to the European market yeah I

281
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,948
agree so of course you cannot do that on

282
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,019
your own you have to find

283
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:05,958
the matching partners and I think that I

284
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:08,149
mean most of us are here today to do to

285
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,998
do so so we're basically we're going

286
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,828
into the markets we're attending

287
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:15,199
conferences like this and trade shows

288
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:18,078
like this where we find those people you

289
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:20,118
know and where we can we can talk to

290
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,479
each other we can share our visions as

291
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:26,209
you said too and so I think platforms

292
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,069
like these enable us to or to to do so

293
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:32,298
to find the people that we want to work

294
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:33,889
with so this particularly for veteran

295
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:35,778
and Vince and Vincent you guys are both

296
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,089
on the ancillary side of the primarily

297
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,129
on the ancillary side of the business do

298
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:41,869
you think it's more or less important in

299
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,709
terms of how you you know vet the folks

300
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,089
you're going to work with like you could

301
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,368
have vendor relationships with folks who

302
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,720
aren't necessarily a partner but what

303
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:49,759
are the downsides to choosing the

304
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,869
choosing the wrong partners and in the

305
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,938
ancillary side of the business and how

306
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:55,309
you know how much do you do in terms of

307
00:11:52,938 --> 00:12:00,769
vetting who you're going to do business

308
00:11:55,308 --> 00:12:04,969
with sell your products to well it's

309
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:07,730
it's important to try to not commit

310
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:10,189
yourself too early you have to really I

311
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,389
mean of course you can you can always

312
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:14,958
make a mistake and choose the wrong

313
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:17,659
partner I think there you have to try to

314
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:21,109
back out as as soon as your gut tells

315
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:23,688
you to but in general the the advice

316
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,850
here is to try to not you know make

317
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:29,208
contracts really binding contracts that

318
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,980
could ruin it for for your company and

319
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:33,409
make it very difficult to get out of a

320
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,269
contract like this so I can I can speak

321
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:38,480
for our for ourselves because we've been

322
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:40,249
on the market for quite a while we well

323
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,048
we keep the contracts at least in the

324
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:47,629
beginning really loose and try to build

325
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:49,578
up a relationship of trust with the

326
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,889
people that we work with and then decide

327
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:53,628
based on you know the past couple of

328
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,788
years a couple of months you know try it

329
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:59,720
to try and see how how we work together

330
00:12:55,788 --> 00:13:01,548
and then maybe get into a real serious

331
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,288
business relationship it's very smart

332
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:05,928
yeah just to touch on that quickly I

333
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:08,298
just think like just not exciting

334
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:10,419
exclusive deals right now as ancillary

335
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:12,039
companies is a

336
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,169
because the markets are changing

337
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,759
everyday companies go in and out of

338
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,919
business you don't want to be locked to

339
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,049
one person you can have a verbal

340
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,939
exclusive agreement where you if you

341
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,039
think they're gonna live up to it that

342
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,380
you can move forward in that manner and

343
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,480
just not contract early bind yourself

344
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:29,948
and see if you both work together and

345
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,180
you can live up to your end of the

346
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,549
bargain and they can live up to their

347
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:36,458
into the bargain before you actually

348
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:38,859
contractual eyes that and Chris on the

349
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,268
on the non ancillary side I mean you're

350
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,800
with your business is fairly unique in

351
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,328
that it sounds to me and forgive me I

352
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,620
don't I don't know intimately familiar

353
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:46,000
with the business but it sounds to me

354
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,470
like you're you're a licensing

355
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,860
playwright like you're you're you're

356
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,790
licensing your technology to manufacture

357
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,169
so I've done something you're not going

358
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,099
out and winning licenses in every state

359
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,269
in the United States right you're gonna

360
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,970
find license holders and you're gonna

361
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:00,370
license a technology that's R it's

362
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,420
really hard to do on a short-term basis

363
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,889
right it's really hard to just dance

364
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:04,599
with somebody without you know jump into

365
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:06,278
jumping in well if I'm sure how do you

366
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,709
go about the vetting process to make

367
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,120
sure that you don't wind up in a long

368
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,669
term partnership relationship with

369
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,720
someone that you ultimately don't want

370
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:15,278
to work with because those are those are

371
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,139
much those are pretty messy to untangle

372
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,179
these are they're really you're right

373
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:21,639
and you're really difficult it's sort of

374
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:26,698
like getting married every time over and

375
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:30,939
over and over again our sales cycle is

376
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:34,599
traditionally six to 18 months it takes

377
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:38,010
us six to 18 months to close a single

378
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,199
client because we work with

379
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,490
manufacturers of consumer products and

380
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,609
so we're working with chocolate

381
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:48,070
companies and beer companies and wine

382
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,570
companies and protein bar and protein

383
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,420
drinks and all sorts of different

384
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,278
products you can imagine and we work

385
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:56,049
with their food formulators and their

386
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:58,509
biochemists and we have to make sure

387
00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:01,269
that things work so there's round after

388
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:03,850
round after round of formulating and

389
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,789
testing we do clinical trials right now

390
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,159
I mean this is April right so in the

391
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:12,759
last three and a half months we've

392
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,009
completed a rodent nicotine absorption

393
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,470
study we've completed a skin absorption

394
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:20,230
study in San Francisco we're entering

395
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,660
into a human clinical study on CBD in a

396
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,300
capsule format in Eastern Europe that

397
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:26,828
actually started this week we're in the

398
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,359
middle of a two-year research and

399
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:31,000
development program with the government

400
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,800
Federal Government of Canada so we have

401
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,208
a lot of different things going on and

402
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:39,338
the partnership's for finished goods are

403
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:42,639
really really complex because you also

404
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:45,310
have to comply with the regulatory

405
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,549
environment in every country for that

406
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:51,338
food product so when we think about our

407
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:54,399
strategic partnering from lex aria we

408
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,269
really we include the cannabis industry

409
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,120
growers and cannabis products

410
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:03,009
manufacturers but for us it includes

411
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,720
beverage companies alcohol companies

412
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,789
tobacco companies pharmaceutical

413
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,920
companies because our technology is

414
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,838
applicable to nicotine delivery and

415
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,929
vitamins and pain relief and other

416
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,120
things so it's a it's an integral part

417
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:19,179
of our business not a single day goes by

418
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,339
when we're not working on one partnering

419
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:23,948
agreement or another one and quite

420
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,870
frankly if we weren't good at it we

421
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:28,328
wouldn't survive so we have to do it

422
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,769
every single day yeah it's I mean it is

423
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:31,179
a challenge like we face this as well as

424
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:32,589
I mentioned we're multi-state operators

425
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:35,049
so we'll go into another state we'll try

426
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,390
and find a you know somebody in that

427
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:38,740
state who's who offers something you

428
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:41,049
know tangible that we don't have local

429
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,399
connections local real estate a real

430
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:43,629
connection they will tie to local

431
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,789
community generally they're gonna come

432
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,958
in to minority partner position and

433
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:48,159
we've done a lot of these and consulting

434
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,469
deals where we have the long-term

435
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,809
consulting relationships and one of the

436
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,089
things that we've found is there's often

437
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:58,208
not time when you're building these

438
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,220
relationships to really vet somebody

439
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,509
over the long run before you have to

440
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,949
commit to doing this right we're gonna

441
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,289
apply for a license together

442
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:08,709
you got to form a company and you know

443
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:09,908
to analogize this to two you know real

444
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,709
life or the dating world all right like

445
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:13,120
generally you know when you first start

446
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,650
dating somebody like everything's great

447
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,448
and rosy right everyone you they're the

448
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,009
perfect everything's great about them

449
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,870
right like everything seems wonderful

450
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:21,699
but you don't marry that person before

451
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:23,438
you get in your first fight or your

452
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,308
first argument right because that's when

453
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,169
you that's when people's true colors

454
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:27,398
come out and certainly in in this world

455
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:29,259
we find and once you start getting into

456
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:30,129
the weeds and things you start getting

457
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,390
into the heat of an application

458
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,730
processor it's just really stressful

459
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,080
when people are out operating on you

460
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,028
know for three to four hours of

461
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,109
but naive that's when you really see how

462
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,099
it is to work with someone and all of a

463
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:40,869
sudden you find yourself in a situation

464
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,428
where like wow I got to work with this

465
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:43,558
person for the next ten years I've what

466
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,350
did I just get myself into

467
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,148
so I guess might this is sorta lead-in

468
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:51,329
for for the whole panel is I'd be

469
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:53,648
interested if you could give some

470
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:55,960
without without throwing anyone under

471
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:57,639
the bus or maybe giving names if you

472
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,429
could talk about some experiences that

473
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,909
you've had of partnerships gone poorly

474
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,340
and what you've done to untangle those

475
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:12,940
relationships with the least amount of

476
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:15,158
stress and brain damage my industry is

477
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,370
kind of niche I don't want to get into

478
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:22,299
these stories come on now that's a

479
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:23,558
cop-out you know identify yeah well

480
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:28,058
we're a public company there's no way

481
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:30,730
I'm identified I think I would I would

482
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:33,490
just amalgamate a number of different

483
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:39,220
experiences and characters so that it's

484
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:41,649
easier to hide I'll give one example we

485
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:45,009
were so our technology works by

486
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:46,449
enhancing the delivery of an API and

487
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:49,288
active pharmaceutical ingredients so

488
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,880
that can be THC that's an API to us

489
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:53,829
enhancing the delivery and getting that

490
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,419
molecule into your bloodstream at the

491
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:56,918
end of the day if it doesn't get into

492
00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:01,299
your bloodstream it's not going to do

493
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,460
any good that's what we do so we've been

494
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:06,668
approached by a company in California

495
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,970
and took the call and they are a leading

496
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:13,179
a leading force a well known company

497
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,940
private in in California one of the

498
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,580
biggest companies in their particular

499
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:22,000
niche so this is a company that's

500
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:24,250
probably selling I'm going to guess 60

501
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,048
to maybe 90 million dollars a year

502
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:31,538
that's probably their revenue and our

503
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:33,819
president John he flies down starts to

504
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:37,629
go to work in their factory working on

505
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:39,579
formulations and second day the

506
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,860
president of the company comes in and

507
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,138
he's trying to get an idea exactly what

508
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:45,729
we're doing and we're showing how to

509
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:47,649
improve the delivered delivery of the

510
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,079
THC through there

511
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,970
through their product and we're going

512
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,710
through the whole process and John says

513
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,610
to a mother this is how you're going to

514
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:59,170
deliver about three times more THC then

515
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,699
through the process you've been using

516
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,529
that's a lot right that's a big

517
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,900
difference so instead of delivering

518
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:07,089
maybe 10 milligrams of THC your customer

519
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,430
is actually going to experience the

520
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,849
equivalent of 30 it's a big difference

521
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:15,820
so the question from the president of

522
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:19,058
this other company to us was he looks

523
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:22,659
kind of worried and he says well well

524
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:25,920
that's all well and good but if you're

525
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:29,350
enhancing the absorption of the THC are

526
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:35,890
you also enhancing the absorption of the

527
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:40,329
pesticides and you know we had to stop

528
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,860
for a second and we kind of looked at

529
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:45,339
each other like well how do you answer

530
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:46,928
that yeah right because the answer is

531
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:49,419
well if there's any pesticides in your

532
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:52,150
product you're breaking the law as well

533
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,220
as you're a real if you know

534
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,160
that it's there and you're delivering

535
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,679
that to your customers the reality in

536
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,820
California is that independent studies

537
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:07,600
over and over and over again pre January

538
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:09,909
1 show that over 90 percent of all the

539
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,399
cannabis sold on the street or through

540
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,920
dispensaries in the state of California

541
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,720
before regulation is contaminated with

542
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,550
pesticides herbicides or heavy metals so

543
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,440
you know there is a very genuine

544
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,149
question coming from and somebody who

545
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,250
could be an industrial partner to us

546
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,080
worrying that he's going to poison his

547
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,690
consumers more than he's already

548
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,089
poisoning them so we said thank you very

549
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,890
much and goodbye and you know that was

550
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:38,199
the end of that relationship so it's

551
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,880
just an example of where it can go I

552
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,029
mean it can be really uncomfortable

553
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,580
really really quickly I have a story for

554
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:47,170
you great all right

555
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:49,869
the moral of the story is as you're

556
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,670
starting out don't get bullied by bigger

557
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:54,250
companies

558
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:56,590
great point so some companies out there

559
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,009
will know that you're starting out and

560
00:21:56,589 --> 00:22:01,089
some people out there are willing to

561
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:05,319
take advantage of those

562
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:09,429
situations in a in our position me and

563
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:11,319
my co-founder Sam my partner we were

564
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,910
starting out it was about we were about

565
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,529
a year and a half into business and

566
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,110
we're at the point if we're gonna raise

567
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:19,960
capital if we're gonna take on more

568
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:23,409
partners if we want to do a buyout we

569
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,289
were we're an insulin company we had we

570
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,640
had positive revenue positive cash cash

571
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:29,440
flow we were profitable so we were

572
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,790
attractive to people investing in the

573
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,309
cannabis industry especially because

574
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:35,710
people didn't want to necessarily touch

575
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:39,399
the plan or not so we were approached

576
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,870
with a certain deal by a very well known

577
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,810
company in the industry and that's what

578
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:45,159
we'll say and they they they wanted to

579
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,690
buy us out and they wanted to add a

580
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,950
product division to their already

581
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,299
existing company and we were really

582
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,009
excited about it why wouldn't you be

583
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,799
there really well no company you want to

584
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,299
do it but then the we sit down at a

585
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,529
table and the deal you're presented and

586
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,629
then you get back to your lawyers in the

587
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:04,119
deal that's in the contract is a totally

588
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,920
different deal so what that happened I

589
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,929
didn't even respond we were done with

590
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,880
the deal you don't sit and like if

591
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,769
someone's gonna lie to your face like

592
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,030
that and then it's one thing if the

593
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:14,859
wording is a little different because

594
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:17,259
the lawyers got involved but if it's a

595
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:19,899
completely different deal I would just

596
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:23,319
walk away at that point yeah I mean it's

597
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,930
a great point be be really careful when

598
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,279
signing contracts particularly if you're

599
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,810
newer and you're starting out and you're

600
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,399
dealing with with folks or companies

601
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,799
that are a lot more established we've

602
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,810
seen a lot of entrepreneurs small

603
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,609
business owners get just badly screwed

604
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,990
over because they didn't really

605
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:41,589
understand the can't stand the contracts

606
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,750
use a good contractual attorney there

607
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:45,609
are a lot of cannabis attorneys who can

608
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,319
be very good at understanding regulate

609
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:48,789
and regulations but I found a lot of

610
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,039
cannabis attorneys tend to try and do

611
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,659
more than what's outside their area of

612
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,940
expertise you really want a good

613
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,440
contracts lawyer or good business lawyer

614
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,820
to look over those contracts before you

615
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,220
sign them and I'll give an example here

616
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:01,389
also the nameless company but we got a

617
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,470
whole I've got a hold of an operating

618
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:08,680
agreement of a this was a dispensary

619
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,210
operation where the investors who were

620
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,230
quite sophisticated and had been around

621
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,039
for a while signed an operating

622
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,690
agreement with the folks who had

623
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,829
originally won the license and it

624
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,080
created which is very common

625
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,428
you know two classes of shares for the

626
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,778
founders and for the investors and

627
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,980
usually there's more protections for the

628
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:22,509
investors which makes sense to protect

629
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,179
your money but they basically create

630
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,980
across a class of shares where the

631
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,960
original shareholders could be removed

632
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,490
for cause for all these different

633
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,880
reasons right or if they're subject of a

634
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,500
criminal investigation and then the you

635
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,528
know the investors could never be

636
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,089
removed for any reason including cause

637
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:41,679
and you know and then later on we've in

638
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:43,000
we've seen this is this is a game you

639
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,970
see some folks play were then they will

640
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,528
they will start a criminal investigation

641
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,819
against their partners against some out

642
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,079
you know for some allegation and use

643
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:51,548
that as an opportunity to remove them

644
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,689
from the company and take the whole

645
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:54,730
company right this is just one example

646
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,700
where we've seen a lot of these types of

647
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:00,519
games particularly from some of the less

648
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,690
ethical Wall Street veterans who you

649
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,220
know think that they can use their money

650
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,808
to basically take what they want rather

651
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,740
than forming a strategic partnership I

652
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:07,148
don't know if this is something you guys

653
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,200
have encountered but I think that's a I

654
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:11,109
think this is something that you know

655
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,490
folks need to be really wary of you know

656
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,778
when dealing with you know big-money

657
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,960
players particularly those who are new

658
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:19,778
to the industry oh yeah I mean if

659
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,759
there's a universal piece of advice look

660
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:23,500
you know I'm I'm I'm almost 60 years old

661
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,970
I'm in business a long long time in a

662
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,839
lot of different sectors in different

663
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:31,839
countries do not try to save money by

664
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:35,048
not using a good law firm just don't do

665
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,638
it don't even think about doing it right

666
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:41,648
now we have five different law firms

667
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:43,148
that are regularly engaged by us ones

668
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:45,579
for intellectual property ones for

669
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:47,589
cannabis law contract law all sorts of

670
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:49,480
different things and I don't like

671
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:52,000
spending money I don't like wasting

672
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,829
money but a good contract and

673
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,990
understanding what it what what it is

674
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:57,579
that you're signing and making sure that

675
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,048
you're asking for the thing that you

676
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:00,038
think you're asking for and you're not

677
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:02,798
asking for something completely

678
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:06,069
different because you use the wrong word

679
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:09,028
I've seen it one wrong word in a

680
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:11,138
sentence understand your grammar

681
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:13,058
understand what it is that you're

682
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:17,528
talking about it's really important

683
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:19,538
contract law is very important so we're

684
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:21,970
we got about five minutes left here I've

685
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:24,548
want to open it up for any quick quick

686
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,019
audience questions let's hear it again

687
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:28,500
for the panel to by the way very

688
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,500
informative

689
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,690
always be careful who you work with

690
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,990
humans are all humans the question oh

691
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:48,559
there you are

692
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:50,150
hi Marguerite my question is kind of

693
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,759
like a follow-up

694
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:55,220
it's very careful to go out there and do

695
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,440
your diligence on both sides right

696
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,170
it's basically what you're saying

697
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:03,559
absolutely and how are some of the

698
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,150
clever non-legal ways to do due

699
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,619
diligence that you might I mean it is

700
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,660
important to have a lawyer but what are

701
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:10,549
the common-sense things that you would

702
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,480
suggest as a panel with international

703
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:15,200
experience because there are other

704
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,970
gotchas I would vet the people that

705
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,289
you're going to business by other people

706
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,750
they've done business with yes

707
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:23,509
pattern of behavior holds true a lot of

708
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,400
time so credibility like build their

709
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:27,470
credibility through the there ask them

710
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,820
for some references some people that

711
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,500
they work with see who do they do

712
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:32,089
business with because who did they do

713
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,069
business with has a lot to say what

714
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:35,329
they're what they have to say about them

715
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,439
has a lot to say about their character

716
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,990
and how they're gonna do business with

717
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,289
you moving forward run a background

718
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:44,870
check is there services that do

719
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:46,159
background checks good in mind yeah that

720
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:48,079
to hire somebody to do a background

721
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,880
check if you've got hundreds of

722
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,379
thousands of dollars look I'm a venture

723
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,610
capitalist for almost 20 years I've

724
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,060
written checks to hundreds of companies

725
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:58,099
in my career check them out

726
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:59,779
how much money are you spending are you

727
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:01,339
spending nothing but your whole life is

728
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,389
at risk your business something you've

729
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:05,359
worked on for twenty years

730
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,640
check them out spend the money talk to

731
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,869
their customers you know talking talk to

732
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,820
their customers and find out what they

733
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:12,169
like and what they hate yeah one thing

734
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:14,000
I've found I found helpful is to ask

735
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,529
potential partners you know tell me

736
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,119
about a business relationship that's

737
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:18,230
gone wrong everyone's had them it

738
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,789
doesn't necessarily mean that they've

739
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,769
done wrong or that they're you know

740
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,899
unethical but you know tell me about a

741
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:26,000
relationship that's gone wrong what went

742
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,590
wrong how did you handle the situation

743
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,240
and can I talk to the person on the

744
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:30,740
other side of that yeah all right and

745
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,640
oftentimes I mean we'll do that

746
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,440
obviously talk to people who have been

747
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,730
in business disputes and I'll look at

748
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,779
both sides and say yeah I'm comfortable

749
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,130
with the way that went down like

750
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:39,049
business disputes happen it doesn't

751
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,730
necessarily mean that these are

752
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,470
unethical

753
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,360
people but it's good to understand the

754
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,130
disputes that people have been in and

755
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,299
how they resolve those situations how

756
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:55,180
folks are feeling about it after the

757
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:59,829
fact that's good good evening pal

758
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:02,920
do you foresee the rules in the States

759
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:06,939
changing to export products into other

760
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:09,640
countries I do but it may try to put a

761
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,340
timeframe on that is impossible right I

762
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,800
mean eventually federal prohibition the

763
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:16,119
United States has to end you know I'm

764
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,129
sure I know I don't like using the

765
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:19,779
inevitable word because I think that

766
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,280
disincentivizes people to get involved

767
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:23,139
in advocacy and activism to make this

768
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,970
happen and people think it's inevitable

769
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,800
right there lessons that incentivize to

770
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,589
get involved but we are at over 60

771
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,509
percent support publicly this is legal

772
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:32,409
now in a lot of swing states in the

773
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,879
United States gonna be much more

774
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,430
difficult for presidential candidates

775
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,020
moving forward to talk line on

776
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,299
legalization so I think we're eventually

777
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:41,889
going to get there and when that happens

778
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:44,319
the u.s. eventually does I think open up

779
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,820
for for export the question is whether

780
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,439
in my mind really is whether the United

781
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:50,500
States is going to be the most efficient

782
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,789
place to produce low-cost products or

783
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,769
whether that's going to start moving to

784
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,480
producer countries with much lower cost

785
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:56,529
of production I think it's going to be a

786
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,110
combination I think that's gonna take a

787
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:00,990
while open question I think those are

788
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:03,279
excellent comments I would actually

789
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,450
split the question into two though

790
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,569
because I think you're gonna have a

791
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,090
different answer on on cannabis than you

792
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:12,159
are in hemp and the wave that's hitting

793
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:15,490
America right now listen where we buy

794
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,960
hemp oil that's one of the things we do

795
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,410
and we've been buying it for years I

796
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,799
have watched the price of CBD and hemp

797
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:25,930
oil drop from 16 to 17 cents a milligram

798
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:29,109
about three and a half years ago it's

799
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,539
currently around 1.1 cent that is more

800
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:33,909
than a 90% reduction and it is going to

801
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:36,039
drop a ton this year because for the

802
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,000
first time in American history modern

803
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,769
American history

804
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,130
you're going to have tens of thousands

805
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:44,680
of acres of hemp grown outdoors it's

806
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,030
being planted right now in the spring

807
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,080
it's going to be harvested this summer

808
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:51,009
and fall the American farm advocacy

809
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,129
group

810
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:57,640
are very very very strong I'll bet you

811
00:30:54,130 --> 00:31:00,310
you will see hemp and CBD being exported

812
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,770
from the United States two to four years

813
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:06,759
THC I think is quite a bit further down

814
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:09,700
the road all I have is I agree with

815
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:12,160
maybe the Wiimote u.s. might not be the

816
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,350
best economic place to be growing

817
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,080
cannabis people are starting to look at

818
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:18,879
South America West Africa other places

819
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,669
that might be cheaper labor and cheaper

820
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,060
energy cost to grow cannabis that's

821
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,259
right

822
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:27,909
but we still do grow the best cannabis

823
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:30,549
for sure yes I didn't mean to be so loud

824
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,630
but yeah but that's a thing like I think

825
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:33,669
we're out of time but I would love to

826
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,590
talk about the commodity versus the

827
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,180
craft aspect because your first thing is

828
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:38,439
like well we can always do it for the

829
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,570
lower price but is that always the

830
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,960
better way outdoors go for it for

831
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:46,000
extraction versus indoor small batch

832
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,559
craft will we'll be living in United

833
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,839
States but it's a high price point for

834
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,220
for that crop it's the two different

835
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,740
products at the end of the day people

836
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:56,589
buy fancy beer from Germany in America

837
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,150
all the time so we will see thank you

838
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:00,359
all very much for the panel thank you

839
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,360

840
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,839
