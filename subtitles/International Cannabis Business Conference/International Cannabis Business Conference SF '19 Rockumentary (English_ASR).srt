5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,460
at the ICBC San Francisco it's just

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:50,070
really heartening and refreshing to see

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:52,230
how the industry is growing so I was

8
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,299
telling Alex I told Alex this morning

9
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,640
that the opening event that they had

10
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,979
last night a VIP cocktail party between

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,870
the cocktail parties and the smoke

12
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,420
session that was going on outside on the

13
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:07,359
street I met so many

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,510
would not have otherwise met people were

15
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,180
incredibly accessible you know hanging

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,000
out with retired NBA Hall of Famers

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,240
people that are leaders in the cannabis

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,099
industry and people that were new to the

19
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:26,079
cannabis industry meet and greet the

20
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:28,509
night before it's a great networking

21
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,599
event it's wonderful to meet other

22
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:34,868
people that we hold hands with in the

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,909
industry making new relationships and

24
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:38,650
new business opportunities new

25
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,519
possibilities

26
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,770
well I tv3 of a lot of the

27
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,408
school activists who really love and

28
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,719
respect the plans and are also kind of

29
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,729
making the week to become more

30
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,069
professional and move

31
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:57,069
it's going so I think it's nice about

32
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:58,329
what what Alex and team do is gain the

33
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:00,429
right people in the room to have those

34
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:03,640
important conversations very

35
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,950
professional very international vibe the

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,570
fact that he does one and Berlin is do

37
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,159
one in Barcelona and yeah

38
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,289
the conference's are really important

39
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,359
because it's a place for folks who are

40
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:14,679
interested in the industry to come here

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,600
and find out more about it

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,150
but Alex does an amazing job there's

43
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,879
this altruism in the cannabis industry

44
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,530
that comes out at these ICBC events

45
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,060
everybody who loves this industry

46
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,860
everybody wants to be a part of it but

47
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,479
not a lot people know what's going on on

48
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,600
the ground level and this is kind of

49
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,939
that really opens people they're trying

50
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,949
to Shepherd this industry into the

51
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:38,129
future to me it's a lot more fun than

52
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:40,899
being at sort of the more cut-and-dry

53
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,669
corporate events with people who only

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,129
look at it as a commodity and don't

55
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,859
really

56
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,659
enjoy the plans and celebrate the plant

57
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,680
in the same way it's all about the love

58
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,219
you know it's all about building

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,219
community

60
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:04,090
I think what Alex was done here at the

61
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:05,949
ICBC is just transformative and ICBC is

62
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,840
just amazing conference this isn't my

63
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:11,129
first and it won't be

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,129
we love this place
