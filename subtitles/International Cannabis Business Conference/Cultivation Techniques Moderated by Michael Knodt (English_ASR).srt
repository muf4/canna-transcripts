next panel is going to go over

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,910
cultivation techniques very important

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,340
because without the farmers without the

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,439
cultivators the cannabis industry really

9
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,800
doesn't go anywhere so I'm going to

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,179

21
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:12,689
be will be dedicated to growing

22
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:15,328
techniques ever tightening regulations

23
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,728
and oversight related that related to

24
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:19,618
cultivation our panel of elite elite

25
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,539
industry scientists and growers will

26
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,118
discuss topics are ranging from

27
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:26,579
regenerative farming and breeding to

28
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,519
organic pesticides at microbiological

29
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:31,709
screening methods as they relate to more

30
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,009
stringent and evolving testing

31
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:38,280
requirements the ICBC invited foreign

32
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:42,868
five leading experts but I have to admit

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:47,248
due to unforeseeable circumstances we

34
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:49,709
are only four people today Tom could not

35
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:52,228
come to farmer Tom could not come and

36
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,379
say he lets his ISIL out to the audience

37
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,450
for the ICBC and sorry that he could not

38
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,978
come but still I think we have four

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,899
leading experts from the growing

40
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,840
industry who can give us a very unique

41
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,228
or very good insight into the legal

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:13,539
cannabis industry

43
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:17,139
in the USA and in Canada and I am proud

44
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:19,239
to introduce like people from Florida

45
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:21,129
from big companies people from the

46
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,439
grassroots movement people from our

47
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,719
grows from the science it's not it's

48
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,539
also not only about drawing it's also

49
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,568
about science and research about

50
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:34,019
cannabis drawing and I want to start

51
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:37,199
with Pete hello Pete

52
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:40,870

55
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:46,500
six locations across the Rocky Mountains

56
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:49,599
in Colorado

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,509
Pete Briggs 30-plus years of growing

58
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,639
knowledge to his current profession from

59
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:56,590

outer cannabis grows across the country

61
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,759

62
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:03,219
has experience working with traditional

63
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,739
and alternative growing mediums and

64
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:08,199
running operations that use both natural

65
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,060
and artificial light in addition to the

66
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,129
growing side of the cannabis business

67
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,049
peak that Pete has deep depth

68
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,699
understanding of the retail aspect for

69
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,400

relaxed attitude to a high-pressure

72
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:25,000
industry and his his work welcoming

73
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,939
qualities make him an approachable

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,299
resource for all things about cannabis

75
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:33,579
and my first question Pete I'm in

76
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,709
Germany the regulations for growing in

77
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,959
medical cannabis do not allow to grow

78
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,689
medical cannabis in greenhouses or even

79
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,370
outdoor and according to Colorado

80
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:44,319
requirements can you fulfill the

81
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,379
standards for medical grade cannabis in

82
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,039
greenhouses or even outdoor and how can

83
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:55,359
you achieve that so we've been growing

84
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:58,349
in greenhouses now since 2014 and what

85
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:00,819
we have found is that in a high-tech

86
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,780
energy-efficient greenhouse which we now

87
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:07,328
have that these things are possible

88
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,919
we are regulated by several bodies in

89
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:10,959
Colorado we're regulated by the

90
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,079
marijuana Enforcement Division which

91
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,019
gives us licensing and sets fines and

92
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,598
fees as far as infractions of

93
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,189
rules in Colorado and were also

94
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:23,800
regulated by the Department of

95
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:26,829
Agriculture at a state level and were

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,069
also regulated by the Health and Safety

97
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:33,310
Department for Colorado and between

98
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:38,920
these three entities we have to adhere

99
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:41,220
to very high standards of microbial

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:47,098
[Music]

101
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:50,310
contamination microbial poison as far as

102
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:53,620
pesticides and those types of things and

103
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,720
because this is a foodstuff because

104
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,538
we're we're feeding people this and

105
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,080
people are inhaling this we're held to a

106
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:06,038
very high standard and I guess my point

107
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:09,029
being is that in the right greenhouse

108
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:12,189
environment we can achieve the same

109
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:16,299
level quality and the same standards

110
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:18,908
that you would in a warehouse in Germany

111
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,449
I guess we're not you folks are not able

112
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:25,449
to grow in greenhouses yet but I see

113
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,610
that as an evolution and at some point

114
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,069
in the next several years you're going

115
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,379
to have that opportunity in Colorado

116
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,319
right now because it is so competitive

117
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:38,589
there are so many growers in the market

118
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,750
it all gets down to cost and at some

119
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:44,888
point in time you're going to realize

120
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:47,439
that greenhouses and outdoor grows for

121
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,509
especially oils and extracts and that

122
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:54,459
type of thing are the only way that

123
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:57,759
you'll survive the market thank you very

124
00:05:54,459 --> 00:06:01,209
much for the insight and I think I come

125
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,389
to : now : hello Colin Colin's

126

co-founder and co-inventor of the chief

127
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,668
growth officer and chief growth of

128
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:12,339
etcetra grow sentÃ­a he's completed his

129
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:15,370
studies in soil microbial by crow bio

130
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,818
triolic ecology sorry complicated work

131
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,879
for me

132
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:21,218
and as a research scientist of Colorado

133
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,259
University Colin published thousands of

134
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:27,418
peer-reviewed publications that were

135
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:30,520
focused on micro bio by micro bio

136
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:32,709
microbial mediated processes that

137
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,918
Nath's plant growth sorry that I have to

138
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:38,168
read that from from the document : left

139
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,750
his academic position at Colorado State

140
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:43,120
in the university in March 2015 and

141
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,759
launched Ross entia present he has a

142
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,610
young startup company in the AG tech

143
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,129
sector that develops microbe microbial

144
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,288
and solid it is that sustainably

145
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:56,080
increase plant yield across many crops

146
00:06:53,288 --> 00:07:01,589
which in easy words is to say to say in

147
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:06,180
introverts you develop products to that

148
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:09,810
replace fertilizer and that we plays

149
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,090
fair of artificial fertilizing and

150
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:17,439
fertilizing in general and so my first

151
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:20,439
question is may ask you to explain that

152
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,829
in easy words you replace classic

153
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,529
fertilizers and organic nutrition and

154
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:28,508
may ask you to explain the basic

155
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,218
principle of it sure thanks everyone for

156
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,348
being here as a scientist at the

157
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:34,478
University focused on agricultural and

158
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:36,759
in soil health and microbial ecology in

159
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,740
general we know as scientists and we

160
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,750
know it's agriculture specialists that

161
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,788
it's critical deliver nutrients to

162
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,399
plants we know that's really a challenge

163
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:47,079
nutrient use efficiency in agriculture

164
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,818
systems as it is in can't in the

165
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,709
cannabis industry and we started

166
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,900
focusing on natural microbial

167
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,728
technologies that can maximize the

168
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:57,310
plant's ability to take up nutrients

169
00:07:54,728 --> 00:08:00,339
maximizing nutrient use efficiency for

170
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,009
many nutrients so plants can naturally

171
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:06,068
maximize their health development

172
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,500
quality and yield so the goal of our

173
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,750
team we started at the University and

174
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,819
now we've bridged and we focus 100% on

175
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,668
the cannabis industry is bringing

176
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:19,000
natural microbial solutions to

177
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:22,870
cultivators so we can naturally enhance

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,089
plant quality and plant yield again

179
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,978
using natural processes which we think

180
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:31,209
it's important not only for cannabis but

181
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:33,968
for all agriculture segments ok thank

182
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,468
you and I'll come back later and to

183
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:38,140
board details now I want to introduce

184
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,020
Michael Michael is vice president of

185
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,788
conviron and he is the world leading

186
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:43,629
designer and supply of controlled

187
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,309
environments for

188
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:48,250
blood growth rooms in the plant research

189
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:51,069
and Adri biotech sectors and you have

190
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,370
installed thousands of facilities around

191
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,890
the world over the last last decades are

192
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,500
your company has installed a lot of

193
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:04,960
facility around the lis within the last

194
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:07,299
years and you are leading the expansion

195
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,870
into the cannabis sector of your company

196
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:12,939
so my first question to you is how do

197
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,070
the regulation for Germany regarding

198
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,160
standardization influence the design of

199
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,750
cannabis grow rooms in general great

200
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,159
thank you

201
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,200
first of all thanks everyone for hanging

202
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:25,449
around for this last session looking

203
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,690
forward to just a few more minutes with

204
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,640
you today one first lesson I learned is

205
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,830
have a longer introduction and use

206
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,699
bigger words in my intro so that I can

207
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,740
match some of these guys here what what

208
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,110
I wanted to just open up here with it

209
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,779
was the interesting aspect of the

210
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:48,779
regulations in Germany and their focus

211
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:50,949
on standardization and that that

212
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,250
recumbent very well because what were

213
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,640
the way we approach the world of growing

214
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,320
and growing cannabis is to provide

215
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,169
solutions that create environments that

216
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,350
really lead to standardize that comes of

217
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:08,799
plants and what we see is that the the

218
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,080
level of control is what really drives

219
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,939
the outcomes of plants so if you want

220
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,030
standardized results standardized

221
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,610
phenotypes the standardized chemical

222
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,889
outcomes or physical properties of the

223
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,850
plants you really need to zero in on

224
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:27,399
control and so that control comes from

225
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,639
two different aspects one is really the

226
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:34,329
brains behind the operation which means

227
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:37,240
the control system itself and also the

228
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,310
body of the grow system which is all the

229
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,240
electrical and mechanical components the

230
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:45,250
HVAC and irrigation and fertile and I

231
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,370
was trying to explain that to someone in

232
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:51,190
the in a situation like this a while ago

233
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,289
there's a professional athlete and that

234
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,380
athlete understood it when I said well

235
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:56,899
you need the brains that are sharp and

236
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,539
adaptive and

237
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:01,549
flexible and robust but you also need

238
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:03,919
the body with the muscles and the bones

239
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:06,169
that can be responsive to those controls

240
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,208
and so when you put together both the

241
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:10,639
brain and the body you have a system

242
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:12,649
then that will allow you to control the

243
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,808
growth so that you can end up with

244
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:17,419
standardized results which is really but

245
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:20,808
the German regulations are focused on

246
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:24,678
right now okay thank you very much

247
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:27,469
and Tim let me introduce you and because

248
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:31,308
you're also very involved in environment

249
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:33,319
control as well and so chair mr. Cyril

250
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:35,088
interpreter who with two successful

251
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:38,360
businesses that were handed over to

252
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:40,910
management to solely focus on changing

253
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,619
the way the plant the planet feeds it

254
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:49,669
grows itself so unless bio and Jeb is

255
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:51,499
focusing on patented D human IOT

256
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:54,558
solutions and other environmental

257
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:56,540
environmental technologies his goal is

258
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:58,818
making his company and Ameri

259
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,618
a world leading spa street a solution

260
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:03,828
provider for the cannabis industry and

261
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:05,959
as we talk in advance before we before

262
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:07,758
the panel your whole family is also

263
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,678
involved in the greenhouse business or

264
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,999
your whole family is very experienced in

265
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:13,188
the greenhouse business we have a

266
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:15,620
agriculture background and we're more

267
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:20,808
focusing on on cannabis industry now

268
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,879
exactly and so the cannabis you're also

269
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:25,009
experienced in other sectors so my first

270
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,870
question to you is what do you think the

271
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:31,068
biggest impact of tightening regulations

272
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,448
in this is in the industry or what you

273
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:34,628
think is the biggest impact of

274
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:37,338
tightening regulations in this industry

275
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:40,730
first of all thanks for having us here

276
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:44,240
on this panel today I think the the

277
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:47,329
tightening in regulations pushed growers

278
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,698
and consultants in Europe and in the

279
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:53,928
states to be more careful about energy

280
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:56,240
consumption and how they designed the

281
00:12:53,928 --> 00:13:01,039
greenhouse especially water consumption

282
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:04,310
and electricity consumption it this is

283
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:09,230
now beginning to have a more of a

284
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:12,750
serious law which which needs to be

285
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:16,440
taken care of on a very high level so as

286
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:19,080
actually Michael said to standardize the

287
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,840
way you grow is really important that

288
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,980
you you use innovative ways and best

289
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,300
techniques to be able to achieve this

290
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,060
okay and when we're talking about

291
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:32,609
standardizing growing and my next

292
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,879
question is comes to Pete in Denver

293
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,730
after the regulation odor was a regular

294
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,649
source for trouble producer producer

295
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,360
said with authorities I remember that

296
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,939
there were a lot of reports in the

297
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,980
newspapers so we do not only talk about

298
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,440
the controlled environment we cone

299
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:54,930
between to also talk about a controlled

300
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:57,180
order neighborhood so is that also uh uh

301
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,799
how can you achieve that or is that as

302
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,539
as complicated to achieve as a

303
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,139
controlled environment to have the

304
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:06,509
controlled neighborhood the odor problem

305
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:09,120
that's a great question and so folks

306
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:12,409
that are working in urban areas and are

307
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,320
specifically have grows in urban areas

308
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:19,169
real challenge right because that

309
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,300
technology has just started and so what

310
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:23,969
we came up with and I'll make this a

311
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:26,969
pretty quick answer was we came up with

312
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,160
carbon filters and we basically designed

313
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,050
an implement of these carbon filters on

314
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,870
our own we could have gone to

315
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,909
manufactured carbon filters but it was

316
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,759
just cost prohibitive for us to do that

317
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:41,850
so we came up with designs of our own

318
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:47,730
accord and implemented those designs and

319
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:50,340
created a several carbon filter system

320
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,090
to go ahead and mitigate as much odor as

321
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,050
possible

322
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,149
can we get zero odor I don't know if

323
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:00,779
that's achievable with carbon I think

324
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,579
there is folks in the near future that

325
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,309
are going to come up with solutions for

326
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,310
odor but with carbon I don't know if

327
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:11,069
that's achievable and the other part of

328
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:13,289
that question I think is that it's about

329
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,899
community outreach too at the end of the

330
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:17,078
day if the

331
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,549
folks in your community see you as

332
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:21,128
somebody that's bad somebody that's

333
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:24,679
doing terrible things to the community

334
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:27,558
then there's almost a placebo effect of

335
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:30,679
what you're doing and and people will

336
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:32,509
say I smell cannabis they may not smell

337
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,028
cannabis but they'll say that they're

338
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:37,610
smelling cannabis because it's very easy

339
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:40,759
to go to a local official and say I

340
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:45,289
smell cannabis it's almost like I see a

341
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,970
communist so it has that effect on

342
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:49,669
people if you go out in the community

343
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,459
and you present yourself in a positive

344
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:54,469
manner if you embrace a community if you

345
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:58,008
have your local community as part of

346
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,800
your your labor solution not a challenge

347
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:02,749
but your labor solution then all of a

348
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,039
sudden they're spending money in the

349
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:05,959
community they're spending money that

350
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:09,740
they're making in your greenhouse or

351
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:13,128
your growth facility that long way and

352
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,928
that has very long legs as far as the

353
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:16,909
people seeing you in a positive light

354
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:19,039
and when people see you in a positive

355
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:21,678
light they're always willing to give you

356
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,928
a little bit more leeway so I would I

357
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:27,948
would say that it's a two-fold answer

358
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:30,860
there may ask you additional question

359
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:32,870
about this topic and I saw we in Germany

360
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,539
there were some reports about a guy

361
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,938
running around with a it looked like a

362
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:40,009
big big back in front of us in the face

363
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:42,969
and he was called the nozzle Sheriff is

364
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:45,800
that true is that existing in Denver

365
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:48,410
yeah the authority somebody with a with

366
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:51,620
the machine and face and he measures the

367
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:53,928
orders the existing so we do have that

368
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,419
in Denver we've got that actually up I

369
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:59,178
asked and also there was a greenhouse

370
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:02,208
having challenges with odor and ask them

371
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:05,709
or right outside of Aspen and there is a

372
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:09,318
machine that will actually on some

373
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:13,189
objective level and I use that it kind

374
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:17,720
of tongue-in-cheek measure the smell or

375
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:20,169
the organics in in the air but how

376
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,970
subjective is that okay

377
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:24,949
what is a wind blowing how hard is the

378
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,860
wind blowing did it rain the night

379
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,460
before is it not rained in five or six

380
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,740
days

381
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,500
so there's all kinds of elements to that

382
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,710
smell meter if you will being accurate

383
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,900
and again I would suggest you know doing

384
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,539
the best you can with mitigating the

385
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,920
smell itself and then also going out in

386
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,529
the community and being the best

387
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,990
neighbor you possibly can be and may I

388
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:51,950
add something people to this because if

389
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:54,609
other is a big problem in the facilities

390
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,680
especially in public places and Europe

391
00:17:54,609 --> 00:18:00,319
we've been designing a lot of facilities

392
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,660
in the middle of the city in Zurich for

393
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,099
example in Switzerland and this is

394
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,620
actually a really big problem

395
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:08,629
so we dived into it a little bit and now

396
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,639
we have great research happening all

397
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:14,120
around the world actually there is

398
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,540
research on how to tap order we also use

399
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,879
HEPA and carbon filters they do work to

400
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:22,579
a certain extent and there is a bunch of

401
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,030
other natural ways of trapping order as

402
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:28,549
well order is a majek molecule and we

403
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:31,910
deal with water molecules in air so you

404
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:34,430
can also manipulate this as well so I

405
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:38,150
believe with companies like yours and

406
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:40,789
and others we're going to get to more

407
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,580
sufficient technologies regarding otter

408
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:45,859
trapping and I absolutely agree with

409
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,349
that and I would tell people that are

410
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:52,099
looking to get into the industry that

411
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:53,929
Ansel Ettore type of companies you know

412
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:55,639
there's an old saying and the the gold

413
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,799
mining business said it wasn't the guys

414
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,390
that were mining goal that made the

415
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,180
money it was the guy selling the picks

416
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,270
and shovels and I would suggest that

417
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,960
that is a great place for folks to get

418
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:11,119
involved is odor mitigation because

419
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,279
there is probably going to be some water

420
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,949
solutions as you alluded to there's

421
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,619
probably going to be some type of

422
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,910
ionization solutions out there in the

423
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:26,479
future so again this is an evolving

424
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:28,940
industry we are on the cutting edge of

425
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,920
the folks that are getting into it now

426
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,690
we're on the ground floor and there's

427
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,370
all kinds of opportunity out there

428
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,799
especially in places like odor

429
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,329
mitigation

430
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:41,658
ok thank you very much

431
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:44,058
and now my next question goes to Colin

432
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:48,860
Colin you're actually you're dedicated

433
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:51,200
your research to soil and I read some

434
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:53,658
within the last year's I read a lot of

435
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,940
publications and in sample retail in

436
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,130
some publications you can read that rock

437
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,288
wall or other hydroponic media are more

438
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,159
suitable for controlled environment what

439
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:06,829
you agree on that I'm not sure if I

440
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,990
agree or disagree I know that I visit

441
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:11,148
grows all over the US all through South

442
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,859
America all through Europe and I've

443
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:15,168
visited hundreds even thousands of

444
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:17,629
commercial grows and engage in the

445
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:19,309
industry 100% that's what I do I go

446
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,679
around and do discovery and learn and

447
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:23,119
try to figure out where there's value to

448
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,820
be made and bringing value to growers

449
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,229
commercial growers there's a lot of

450
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:29,689
commercial growers that are using

451
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,120
rockwool in Denver in you know

452
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,590
Washington state all over the world but

453
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:35,479
there's many many that aren't and

454
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:37,428
there's trade offs and I think you know

455
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,558
there's no one silver bullet solution in

456
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:41,269
agriculture there's no one silver bullet

457
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,918
solution in cannabis cultivation and

458
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:46,819
there's trade-offs with every decision

459
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,590
we make I think in some cases one can

460
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:52,158
feel that there is a more controlled

461
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:55,428
aspect to having a very inert substrate

462
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,260
or media like rock wool but I do think

463
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:59,509
that there are some trade-offs with

464
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:01,339
respect to interacting with the plant to

465
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:03,710
engaging the plants full phenotypic

466
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:06,019
potential and delivering to that plant

467
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,429
what it needs many growers and this is a

468
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:08,659
huge movement especially through the

469
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,580
Pacific Northwest

470
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:13,250
especially through South America and

471
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:15,439
more and more even in Europe people

472
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,919
understand growers understand that we

473
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,110
need to start reproducing soil function

474
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,960
and interactions with microbes and and

475
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:27,439
these effects really maximize the plant

476
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,110
phenotypic potential meaning not only do

477
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,269
we need in today's cannabis industry and

478
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:35,178
I'll speak of it generally in a global

479
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:37,609
level to maximize yield to bring value

480
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:40,370
to growers but quality comes up

481
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:43,189
everywhere we go now and yield although

482
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:46,339
it's very important quality has to

483
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,169
happen and you're gonna distinguish

484
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,849
yourself a tackle as a cultivator and

485
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,679
I've heard it from from growers and

486
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,079
consumers here in Germany through a

487
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,860
quality aspect

488
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:58,990
and so not only is you know these inputs

489
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:00,639
important but environments important and

490
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,079
energy is important all these things

491
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,259
that we are taught what we're talking

492
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:08,740
about on this panel are interacting to

493
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:11,230
maximize not only plant yield to bring

494
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,429
value to farmers but also plant quality

495
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,079
which is which is critical for

496
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:17,009
distinguishing yourself and in

497
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:21,908
maximizing the value of your product

498
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:24,460
thank you very much Michael Colin just

499
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:27,700
told us there are several ways to grow

500
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:30,100
cannabis on several mediums and you

501
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,830
build up dozens of facilities worldwide

502
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:35,469
and it's not only the medium that

503
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:39,369
differs how do the facilities differ

504
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:42,220
from each other you build up right I

505
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:43,058
think what we've seen as we travel

506
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,419
around the world and see different

507
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:48,428
facilities is the vast diversity of how

508
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:52,600
people approach designing their

509
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,640
facilities so they're looking at using

510
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,490
different technologies and different

511
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,169
design configurations so if we if we set

512
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,298
aside the green house side which is not

513
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,909
my area expect of expertise right now

514
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:06,009
but from an indoor growing facility

515
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,490
perspective what we see is vast

516
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:11,890
diversity in the lighting that is chosen

517
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:14,079
whether that's LED or HPS or other forms

518
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,720
of lighting we see people wanting to

519
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,908
have very distinct indoor environments

520
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,399
for the different stages of growth of

521
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:24,520
the plants so from clone to veg to

522
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:26,798
flowering to even drying and so want to

523
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,240
look at different solutions for how they

524
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,569
grow whether that's hydroponics

525
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,480
aeroponics in multiple tiers or just in

526
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:36,428
a single tier of plants and so we see

527
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,099
this wide range of diversity and all

528
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:41,288
these elements have to be anticipated in

529
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:44,528
the design of an indoor growing room and

530
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:47,950
so what we do is we see how these

531
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:51,849
elements come together and what we what

532
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:55,419
we really see six is we can create a

533
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:57,369
highly uniform environment so that all

534
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:59,740
the plants within that environment are

535
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:02,229
growing at the same rate and they're

536
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,210
maturing at the same time throughout the

537
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,620
room so whether it's the back corner or

538
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,140
the

539
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:09,389
of the room everything is maturing at

540
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,360
the same rate so you get that uniformity

541
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:14,250
not only of yield and and outcome but

542
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,798
also in the specific properties of the

543
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,528
plant and one of the ways that we see

544
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,980
that varying from room to room is how

545
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:27,419
different people handle airflow so we

546
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,130
look at how to direct air in different

547
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,049
directions to accommodate the different

548
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,840
growing systems that the grower is going

549
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:37,048
to choose in general we we tried we

550
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:40,009
strive for a very uniform and laminar

551
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:42,690
flow of air but often it's the way the

552
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:44,519
growing system is configured we have to

553
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,519
work around that as well so the

554
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,710
diversity of the growing techniques has

555
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,700
a big impact on how the rooms are

556
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:56,490
ultimately designed thank you very much

557
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,308
and let me just come to the next

558
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,609
question about growing rooms or how to

559
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:06,028
fill fulfill the standardization best

560
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:08,879
way Tim and what do you think what use

561
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:11,069
is for upcoming trends in the near

562
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:17,130
future regarding altima say out of my

563
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:19,439
automation and in the grow room there is

564
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:24,929
so much innovation happening in the in

565
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:29,009
in the world in the sector my expertise

566
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:31,528
is more airflow water usage and air

567
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:34,109
circulation actually like Michael

568
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:35,880
mentioned and how we can extract the

569
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:41,308
water that the plants are transpiring

570
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:46,320
and how we can reuse the energies inside

571
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:49,889
as in latent energy and it's it's also

572
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,619
as automated as automation it's now I'm

573
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,538
seeing that there are lots of automation

574
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:57,928
in benches there is automation in

575
00:25:54,538 --> 00:26:00,679
everything now but IOT is a very

576
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:04,110
important part of the design I think

577
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,538
everything should collect data and you

578
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:08,639
should be able to see how well your

579
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:10,408
automation is working and the outcome

580
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,059
because doing the automation is

581
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:15,429
something but also

582
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:18,278
see the outcome positively it's so

583
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:22,179
important what you use for what

584
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:26,470
automation so I guess it's it's

585
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:28,749
something to do with with with idea of

586
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:32,110
the grower what what exactly they want

587
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:35,169
to achieve and then you can you can use

588
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:38,408
the automations regarding to the topic

589
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:40,389
statement when we first met today and

590
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:42,610
you had you told me a very interesting

591
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:44,798
detail I have never heard so much about

592
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,479
yet because I know that the humidity

593
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,778
humidity in the grow rooms is a big

594
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,329
problem and you found a way to suck out

595
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:55,929
the humidity out of the air and off yeah

596
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:58,178
so we patented kind of renew and yeah we

597
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:01,929
patented a way to basically discharge

598
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:05,798
latent energy usually the systems around

599
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:07,869
the world they convert latent energy

600
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:10,990
which is the secret energy inside the

601
00:27:07,868 --> 00:27:13,388
grow chambers into sensible heat so

602
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,490
there's there is always an unwanted heat

603
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:18,069
inside so what we do is we don't

604
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,859
challenge this we just discharge it

605
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:24,428
outside with another medium we use which

606
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:27,248
is a liquid desiccant and this is this

607
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:29,470
is how we actually reduced operation

608
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:32,079
costs this is how we control total

609
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,240
humidity and temperature and this is how

610
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,788
we also recycle the water that we

611
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,710
capture inside the grow house and reuse

612
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,179
it in irrigation and of a clog nearly

613
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,269
closed system yes

614
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:45,669
very interesting thank you and my next

615
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:47,679
question goes to Pete a PPR also a shop

616
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:49,929
owner so how important is

617
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,879
standardization of the products for your

618
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:55,929
business and your customers from my shop

619
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:57,819
owners perspective a great question so

620
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,470
and I think we've kind of talked about

621
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:04,058
that in some of these environmental

622
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:06,278
control questions also so we are looking

623
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:08,769
to standardize all the time we are

624
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:11,980
looking to strive to that place where

625
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:15,128
every time we harvest a certain genetics

626
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,558
that we get the same results do we do

627
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:20,408
that every time well of course not

628
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:24,690
because everything changes almost on a

629
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:28,430
minute-to-minute basis air changes

630
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:31,799
humidity changes sunlight changes

631
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,680
artificial lighting changes co2 content

632
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,649
changes but to the best of our ability

633
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,320
as as much as we can with our

634
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:43,050
environmental controls with our

635
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,329
knowledge about growing cannabis that is

636
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:49,529
what we try to achieve where all of our

637
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:53,659
plants are growing as standard or as

638
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:57,059
close to being standard as possible

639
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,900
thank you very much and in that context

640
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:05,639
my next question goes to Michael Peters

641
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:10,200
told us about you may humanity in the

642
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:14,220
grow room and other critical climate

643
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,110
climate control and what are the the

644
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,420
critical design elements that must be

645
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:20,339
considered in any growing environment I

646
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,960
mean you designed the room so how do you

647
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,199
achieve that how what do you have to put

648
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,360
in any room right I think I left - the

649
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,970
answer to that question in the in the

650
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,000
last time I spoke so I won't repeat too

651
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,230
much other than of course lighting

652
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,509
temperature and humidity are the big

653
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,730
factors that need to be controlled in an

654
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:41,430
especially an indoor in any environment

655
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:45,569
of course but particularly in an indoor

656
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:47,640
environment but what I what I was wanted

657
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:49,710
to leverage that into is just following

658
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,490
on from Pete talking about hitting

659
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:55,049
standards in by controlling the

660
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,589
environment that whether it's greenhouse

661
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:01,079
or indoor one of the things that we see

662
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:03,899
especially from the in the experience in

663
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,019
Canada is and also in the States but

664
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,460
there is a lot of testing a lot of

665
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:10,680
hurdles that have that every product has

666
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,940
to go through and so it's not as though

667
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:18,539
there's no standardization requirements

668
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,620
but when as the industry becomes more

669
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,389
and more competitive

670
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:24,089
I think the growers are going to be

671
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,670
looking for more ways to standardize the

672
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:29,369
way they differentiate their product not

673
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:32,370
just passing the tests of safety and

674
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:35,789
health and making sure all the micro but

675
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:37,919
micro microbial accounts are where they

676
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:38,609
should be but also if you find a way to

677
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,640
different

678
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:44,789
your product from the perspective of

679
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,030
taste smell or experience then you want

680
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:50,639
to be able to dial that recipe into your

681
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:52,950
operation and so having that ability

682
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,140
whether it's your doing a green house

683
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,179
Rover or more particularly an indoor

684
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,400
grow you want to have that ability to

685
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,798
control the light the spectrum the

686
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,160
intensity to manage the humidity

687
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:07,289
properly and also to be able to control

688
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,700
all those other things like additive co2

689
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:18,048
and all your nutrients as well Thanks

690
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:22,169
and Colin you also know a lot about

691
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:26,039
setting after the the the the whole the

692
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:29,100
environment for the plants and there are

693
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:31,829
a lot of regulations where you where you

694
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,629
have your business so in how far do the

695
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:35,730
different regulations in different

696
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,510
states in different countries facilitate

697
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:41,789
or your business that's a pretty fun

698
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:43,890
topic and that makes my job pretty fun

699
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:45,928
as I go everywhere I go it's a new

700
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,210
puzzle to solve every state in the u.s.

701
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:50,790
has different regulatory pressure so to

702
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,910
speak if it's chemical or Crowe Beale

703
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:56,220
and it's really important for those

704
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,840
words to be able to to follow those I

705
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,210
think overall its standard there's

706
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,980
testing labs and and growers can can

707
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,470
follow that I think the the real

708
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,019
challenge with cultivation in general is

709
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,308
mitigating variability and what you want

710
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:09,480
to do and this is what's been talked

711
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:11,700
about more than anything else I think

712
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,548
while we're up here is consistency

713
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:18,990
repeatability and reducing variability

714
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:20,849
so you can dial in the same product time

715
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,900
and time again and if growers can do

716
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,939
that I think that's the biggest

717
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,240
challenge and we talk about you know you

718
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,470
can use a simple phenotype formula what

719
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,910
we're dealing with this precision

720
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,610
agriculture and everything should be

721
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,980
defined as precise as possible always

722
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:37,678
and that's a simple phenotype formula

723
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,500
maximizing our plant quality and yield

724
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,298
to the ideals that we want based on

725
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,339
dialing in our plant genetics over time

726
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:46,200
our environment and inputs over time and

727
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:49,899
that's critical but one thing that

728
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,680
people overlook pretty

729
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:56,820
bad in many cases is workflow and

730
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:00,279
turnover because people create

731
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:03,509
variability and there's a lot of costs

732
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:06,009
associated with workflow that's

733
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:08,349
underestimated and a lot of error and

734
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:10,210
variability that's introduced into

735
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:12,759
growing because of that and so not only

736
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,680
do we have to dial in all these

737
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:17,529
technical details in the infrastructure

738
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:20,170
and climate and repeatable inputs but we

739
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:22,149
have to have our SOPs in place and we

740
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:24,460
have to dial in how we're growing so

741
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,140
we're not wasting a lot of time and a

742
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,789
lot of money I've worked in some groves

743
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,410
that were very efficient that had three

744
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,789
growers have worked with other growers

745
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,820
that didn't seem very efficient that

746
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:35,678
we're about the same size that had 20

747
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:37,599
that's a huge cost and then that

748
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,929
variability and turnover is it's just

749
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:43,928
incredible and it creates a lot of error

750
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:46,450
with with respect to the prot the end

751
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,940
product over time there are any

752
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:53,679
regulation you prosper fun except that

753
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:55,690
it's legal I think we all prosper from

754
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,370
regulation it's important I think that

755
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,519
there's some regulation that the

756
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,479
challenge with regulations is the

757
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,170
regulator's aren't growers

758
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,970
they're typically just chemists they're

759
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,320
people that are following the rules and

760
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,909
are getting informed and sometimes

761
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,250
getting informed from people that aren't

762
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,349
that informed and so when you look at

763
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,599
some of these rules and regulations or

764
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:19,179
their generalities that that create a

765
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:21,460
lot of pressure and extra cost for

766
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:23,889
cultivators and I think it's important

767
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,530
at this stage because this plant this

768
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,750
crop is way more regulated than any

769
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,639
other food crop in the world however

770
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,929
it's consumed very differently than the

771
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,820
other food crop in the world and I

772
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,648
understand those pressures you talked to

773
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,659
the Health Department in Colorado for

774
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,089
example we're very concerned about

775
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,460
pesticide use there's a lot of pesticide

776
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,960
use and is regulated heavily the same

777
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,300
pesticides are used on a lot of food

778
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,449
crops that's not regulated heavily but

779
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,399
we aren't combusting potatoes when we

780
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:54,779
consume them we're combusting this plant

781
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:58,420
we're not extracting concentrating

782
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,850
potato extract where we are with this

783
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,700
plant and even non trace amounts of some

784
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:05,889
chemicals can concentrate into into

785
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:08,318
potentially toxic amounts and so this is

786
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:11,230
a very different beast and health and

787
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:15,699
regulators in general are treating it

788
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,809
very thoughtfully right now and so I

789
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,368
think it's important to work with

790
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:20,230
regulators and educate them to

791
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:22,588
understand where these thresholds of

792
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:26,769
true risk are versus education

793
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:28,449
opportunities to to mitigate that okay

794
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:31,030
thank you and that's quite interesting

795
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:32,588
because we don't have all that here in

796
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,440
Germany because we don't have production

797
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:38,710
you will we know but we don't have that

798
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,440
experience yet yeah and so my next

799
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,750
question goes to chap chap my family's

800
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,480
experience in agricultural or developing

801
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:49,659
and building up greenhouses so we did

802
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,289
not talk about feeding the plants yet

803
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:55,659
and I know that most people most

804
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:59,259
cannabis patients want to have a clean

805
00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:05,710
product in how far does a clean product

806
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:07,180
and and biological organic growing fits

807
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,940
together with the controlled environment

808
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:11,409
is that possible to make a organic

809
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,349
product a hundred percent organic

810
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:19,509
product in a controlled environment the

811
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:25,180
word organic is actually it's a very

812
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:27,490
general word word I would say but it of

813
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:32,649
course it is possible we've been working

814
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:35,529
with grow owners that are shooting for

815
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:39,789
to be more organic to to use less water

816
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:42,640
to use no pesticides even to even

817
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:45,279
aquaponics is now very popular in Europe

818
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,318
regarding even cannabis IRA ponic

819
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,230
growing's you see so all of the mediums

820
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:52,869
do change with the type of growing

821
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:56,519
systems that people are trying to have

822
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:59,710
and achieve but regarding

823
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:02,500
standardization it's important what what

824
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,500
outcome comes from these facilities so I

825
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:09,130
think time is still needed to actually

826
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,469
see what's going on and I also think

827
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:14,160
that data collection is really important

828
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:17,019
regarding questions like this because

829
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,179
you need to prove as well

830
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:22,300
how you achieved it it's not just how

831
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:24,549
you did it but you need to be able to

832
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,300
show what what was your environmental

833
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,530
conditions how you actually got into

834
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,200
producing something more organic and

835
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,300
thanks and let's just go deeper into the

836
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:37,599
additional question how do you achieve

837
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:40,269
that how do you document that you make a

838
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,739
documentation about your your progress

839
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:47,320
and well we have a software that keeps

840
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:50,049
track of anything any electrical

841
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:54,309
equipment inside your facility so you

842
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:56,830
can go back a year back to any month to

843
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:58,570
any out to any day and then monitor a

844
00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:05,799
single plant with it for example yeah

845
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:07,840
you can sync the plants with brief there

846
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,060
is there's many automations and many

847
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,850
systems where you can collect data from

848
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:16,210
it's up to how many sensors you have we

849
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:20,650
we usually use 35 sensors in a you know

850
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:23,139
one room and you can basically go to any

851
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:25,329
time of your girl facility and see what

852
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:27,699
your condition was was in and and prove

853
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,829
it to be honest so this is also

854
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:32,439
documentation is also a very very

855
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:35,170
important part of that is a planted it

856
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,030
is I hate it a rap but we're almost with

857
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,389
me hello hello I'm right here in the

858
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,360
front

859
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:43,179
hello I just want to live I'm hard to

860
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:48,070
notice have a very very last question

861
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:49,899
wait I saved this question until the end

862
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,610
and this'll slightly controversial

863
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,789
question and you have the most

864
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:58,210
experience from everybody here you are a

865
00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:00,759
long time in the machine and thoughtful

866
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,769
legalization and like general question

867
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,850
to you is a little bit controversial but

868
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:08,019
how much regulation does cannabis need I

869
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:10,750
think it needs a lot at the end of the

870
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:13,090
day and the reason I say that is because

871
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:18,280
we want to embrace the public and we

872
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:21,460
want the public to be are our partners

873
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,350
in this without the public without the

874
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,829
guy that's your neighbor and the guy

875
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:29,058
that's across the street from you we

876
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:32,389
don't we don't succeed at this

877
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:34,400
at the end of the day we have to have

878
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:36,618
the general public say this is going to

879
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,099
be safe this is going to be something

880
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:42,619
that we can consume without being hurt

881
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:48,189
has to be something that is not going to

882
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:51,140
affect our children so if we embrace

883
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:54,469
standardization if we embrace regulation

884
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:56,868
that is our best way forward and I can't

885
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:59,059
stress that enough and from folks that

886
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:02,599
are going to be part of this industry it

887
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:05,150
really sets us apart it sets us apart on

888
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,969
so many different levels but more than

889
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,039
anything it makes us better at what we

890
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:13,608
do because the more regulations we have

891
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,169
the better we'll be at this thank you

892
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:16,608
very much thank you that was a nice

893
00:40:15,168 --> 00:40:18,288
final about to say I need to have four

894
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:19,668
questions yeah we have maybe two or

895
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:26,630
three minutes we're gonna start here and

896
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:29,900
then we'll see we Conan I didn't hear

897
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:33,890
much detail about microbial or by

898
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,809
dynamic or alternatives to fertilizers

899
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:37,818
can you expand on that a bit

900
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,199
yeah and we're in brief and we can talk

901
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:40,009
more about it offline actually

902
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,318
microbials

903
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:45,228
are the quickest growing agriculture

904
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,728
segments within all industries because

905
00:40:45,228 --> 00:40:48,379
we understand that microbes and

906
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:50,629
interacting microbes in soil and

907
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,449
substrates help maximize nutrient use

908
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,559
efficiency so it's critical we also know

909
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:56,568
Andy talked to a lot of growers

910
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,548
specifically for this industry it's

911
00:40:56,568 --> 00:41:00,139
becoming very popular in the United

912
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:02,228
States I mean quickly I started my

913
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:04,518
company a couple years ago and now where

914
00:41:02,228 --> 00:41:06,528
we just got product of the year in the

915
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:08,508
UK we're in over a hundred shops in the

916
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:09,918
u.s. we're in over a hundred couple

917
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,958
hundred shops in Europe and all through

918
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:15,889
South America because microbes have

919
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:18,348
expanded even two years ago I had to

920
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:20,118
educate everyone that's my job is

921
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:22,189
education and support like it was at the

922
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,900
universe is a PhD microbiologist it's

923
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,399
the same thing now but I'm focused on

924
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,639
the cannabis industry and educating

925
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,009
growers now it's important I think you

926
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,288
know plants in nature don't exist

927
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:36,469
without microbial interactions none

928
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:38,599
and so interacting and bringing those

929
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:40,969
microbial processes and interactions

930
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:42,710
back into precision agriculture I think

931
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:46,130
does a lot not only

932
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:48,619
maximize value as far as yield and

933
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:50,780
quality but to bring these interactions

934
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,910
that might not be present to the degree

935
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:56,210
that they need to be to maximize again

936
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:58,429
the plant's ability to express some of

937
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:02,119
these quality factors that we really see

938
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:04,399
if you add microbes into iGrow we see

939
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,740
the improved terpene profiles and

940
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,809
improved yields and so this quality

941
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:11,149
metric really goes up along with with

942
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:13,400
yield and so there's a lot of value that

943
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,800
we think that we can bring in general

944
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,440
across all agriculture segments by

945
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,109
incorporating microbes not replacing

946
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,400
fertilizers I don't think that's what

947
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:25,069
we're trying to do and I don't think

948
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,170
that's realistic in some soil

949
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,510
environments where there is a buildup of

950
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,619
nutrients you can actually really reduce

951
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:35,660
fertilizer inputs and replace them with

952
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:36,829
microbial solutions but in precision

953
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:39,469
agriculture you're never going to

954
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:41,259
displace completely fertilizer

955
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:44,598
applications you're going to complement

956
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:50,690
nutrients with microbe life with

957
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:52,760
microbial functionality hello my

958
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:56,329
questions for you as well I'm thinking

959
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,670
about using microorganisms for pest

960
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:01,039
control as well and especially since we

961
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:03,920
heard California has such great problems

962
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:06,259
with pesticides like killing one fungi

963
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,088
with an on the phone other fungi might

964
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,130
be a good idea are you searching for

965
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:12,230
that yeah we are we think that's a

966
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,849
really interesting solution because

967
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,139
there are offs from so many problems in

968
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:18,349
this industry in particular with with

969
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:20,088
chemical solutions and growers in

970
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:21,980
general are really limited to the

971
00:43:20,088 --> 00:43:23,960
solutions they have to control pests and

972
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,119
Tesser a huge problem Russ it might

973
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,740
spider mites powdery mildew depending on

974
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,890
where you are fungal gnats there's a lot

975
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:32,389
of problems especially in mono crops and

976
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:34,159
controlled environments and if we don't

977
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:35,809
have the right solutions it's there's a

978
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:37,549
lot of value to control those and

979
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:40,159
controlling those natural is important

980
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,930
so we still have resources at Colorado

981
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,608
State University we have several 5000

982
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:47,899
square foot greenhouses in a 62 acre

983
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:50,210
farm that we grow cannabis on all to for

984
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,920
agricultural research purposes so we can

985
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:55,220
look for new solutions not only for a

986
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,460
new you know nutrient or bio stimulant

987
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,899
solutions but also for

988
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,059
control solutions so that's what you're

989
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,338
talking about bringing natural solutions

990
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:03,719
for four control aspects as well so we

991
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:10,079
absolutely think that's important and we

992
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:12,059
were doing that yeah one of the stigmas

993
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,119
are often attached to cannabis is it can

994
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:18,539
cause psychosis craziness madness I

995
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,010
watched a documentary blackfish what

996
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,769
happens when you take an orca out of its

997
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:24,420
wild natural environment for more we

998
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:27,059
take cannabis out of its natural

999
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,920
environment generations down the line do

1000
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:32,329
you feel it could be a problem with

1001
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,608
increased psychosis with the more cloned

1002
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:38,009
chemically fed or yeah it's an unnatural

1003
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:47,250
environment possibly create unnatural

1004
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:50,460
plants how can I answer that I think

1005
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:54,210
that that's possible I think that you

1006
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,960
Jim genetically modify any crop that

1007
00:44:54,210 --> 00:45:00,900
that you can run into unexpected

1008
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,869
outcomes and since cannabis and

1009
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,809
especially active THC is psychotropic is

1010
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:11,280
that a potential it absolutely is a

1011
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:12,358
potential I would say great I think

1012
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,680
that's it I think we're gonna leave it

1013
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,019
right there let's hear for the panel

1014
