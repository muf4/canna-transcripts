1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,940
thanks again for everybody joining us

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,859
and that one last thing I failed to

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,919
mention the whole idea is to have this

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:15,899
to be a very Interactive

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,039
beneficial provocative discussion all

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,019
day long but the other thing you'll

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,000
notice this first panel we do not have a

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,800
moderator so the idea is to give

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
everybody a little heads up

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,660
is we're going to start off with one or

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,580
two topics and then from that point we

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,199
want to get in and just kick it out to

13
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,159
the audience because I think that's the

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,719
one thing that's going to be most

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,578
informed for you guys and certainly I

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,840
think for us so Bob do you want to kick

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,619
things off on an introduction of

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,739
yourself

19
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:43,500
sure uh good good morning everybody uh

20
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:46,859
my name is Bob Hoban I'm an attorney and

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,299
an advisor I run the global cannabis

22
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,359
division for Clark Hill an international

23

law firm I also own a company called

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,738
Gateway proven strategies a leading

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,079
Global consultancy and a company called

rating system for businesses in the

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,400
Cannabis industry and it's a pleasure to

29
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:08,700
be here one quick note two quick notes

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,580
uh the the concept of THC plus and minus

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,020
I really really love this concept and I

32
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,060
hope that you can get your minds around

33
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,340
that today because this is not about

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,960
selling flour it's not about just

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,540
selling Vape cartridges with high

36
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,739
concentrations of THC and sometimes in

37
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,659
different parts of the world we get

38
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,339
caught in that little Silo where we

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,740
believe the industry is what we think it

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,540
is but it's far broader than that and we

41
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,579
have to embrace that concept because

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,700
whether we like Delta eight so forth and

43
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,578
so on it's the same sandbox and also

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,020
David you saved me and David by the way

45
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,478
when you go to if you ever gone to the

46
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:45,000
world economic Forum in Switzerland it's

47
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,578
a ghost town during this event because

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,618
everybody flies in and out so I drive

49
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:50,938
into this town I can't find anything or

50
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:52,859
anybody

51
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,359
except for this friendly face who helped

52
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,340
me find where I was going so thank you

53
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,259

54
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,180

chocolate which when I started that

63
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,519
company or started working for that

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,159

Canada and I brought our CBD products

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,659
into nine European countries so I've

69
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:39,299
been in the industry a long time and my

70
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,400
dad has been growing 56 years so I grew

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,620
up knowing what how you know how to look

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,219
at trichomes and how to trim weed

73
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,920
whether I wanted to or not and my cousin

74
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,818
on my mom's side is DJ mugs from Cypress

75
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:56,098
Hill so when I was in law school in 1992

76
00:02:53,818 --> 00:03:00,179
my cousin lit a joint on Saturday Night

77
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:03,719
Live so I then in the industry in one

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,819
form or fashion pretty much all my life

79
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,318
good morning everyone I'm Rob McAvoy I'm

80
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,179
president of the McAvoy Management Group

81
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,458
which is a consulting firm to the

82
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,860
Cannabis space prior to starting my

83
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,620
company I was an owner operator across

84
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,420
multiple states in the United States

85
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,640
formerly I was a VP at a cannabis AG

86
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,859
tech company that was Knack desk listed

87
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,199
so a lot of global cannabis experience

88
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,840
and formulation cultivation extraction

89
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,280
retailing I've been doing this now for

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,019
over a decade in the commercial space

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,818
I've been on the supply and demand side

92
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,800
of cannabis since I was about 14 15

93
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,238
years old though so really looking

94
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,920
forward to the conversation this morning

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,920
keeping it Lively

96
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,419
thanks Rob so as you guys know the title

97
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,298
of this panel is to essentially look

98
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,619
back on the past and so that the first

99
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,219
topic we would like to at least start

100
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:54,239
out with the panelists uh is looking at

101
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:56,818
adult use and medical cannabis both here

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,719
in the U.S all over the world has been

103
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:01,859
treated uh differently or dealt with

104
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,419
differently

105
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,340
what did that what does that mean

106
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,479
historically how's that happen how's the

107
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,039
treatment been different and what are

108
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,500
the implications for the future so

109
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:14,280
ladies first Jamie do you want to

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,658
absolutely I think watching what's

111
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,358
happening in Europe I'm going to start

112
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:20,279
you know how did we get here where we

113
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,779
are right now is Germany and how did we

114
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,799
get here

115
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,138
um

116
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,460
we go back historically and see what

117
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,519
happened in California

118
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:32,339
in the prop 215 which was a let's put

119
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,620
medical program in air quotes which

120
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,079
basically was a way for people to go get

121
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,000
cards and get cannabis so that they

122
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,219
didn't have to worry about going to jail

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,220
and then the industry sort of blew up

124
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,900
from there but where we are now in

125
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,139
Germany it is a true medical program

126
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:51,418
this is in Germany Pharmaceuticals it's

127
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:55,019
going through the apoteca it's going

128
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:56,399
with a prescription and if you know what

129
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,399
you're doing you can actually have the

130
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,739
government reimburse you that's a far

131
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,418
cry from what we saw in California so

132
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,699
many years ago and then there's

133
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:08,099
everything in between the other thing

134
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,759
we're seeing on that THC plus and THC

135
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,280
minus conversation is the explosion of

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,900
hemp derived

137
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,079
products that are

138
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,959
getting people high and they're quote

139
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,300
legal THC and we're also seeing in

140
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,239
Europe that there are places that are

141
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,100
figuring out oh well I can spray

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,139
terpenes on my hemp flower and I can get

143
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,139
people high we're going to get to the

144
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,139
same result the reality is human beings

145
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,199
want this plant uh that's where we are

146
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,060
is it now as you you have more and more

147
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,160
people waking up with access to the

148
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,259
plant you cannot put the genie back in

149
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,300
the bottle so now it's not a matter of

150
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,360
if cannabis is going to be legalized

151
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,520
worldwide it's a matter of when and how

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,740
and these are the rooms where we're

153
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,698
going to shape that conversation

154
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,060
absolutely

155
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,160
so in Colorado back in 2009 2010 we had

156
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,500
a lot of medical marijuana migrants with

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,240
Charlotte's Web coming online we started

158
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,100
seeing a lot more firms bringing

159
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,439
patients with very high needs into the

160
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,000
state to gain access at the same time we

161
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,279
started seeing other medical marijuana

162
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,800
programs open up in Illinois and in

163
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,719
Maryland that started to require or

164
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,699
wanted to ask for a pharmacist

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,919
involvement to bring in more of that

166
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,360
medicinal check and balance as it

167
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,620
relates to the products as it relates to

168
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,139
the potencies and then of course their

169
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,899
therapeutic effects you know that got a

170
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,120
lot of backlash and resistance in the in

171
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,739
the program itself because what we

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,139
really have is a culture versus a

173
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,060
commercialization clash and there are a

174
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,319
lot of Legacy folks from the Cannabis

175
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,780
space who did not want medical

176
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,000
professionals coming in in those

177
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,159
capacities and so with that we started

178
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,899
to see the evolution of more and more

179
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,000
municipalities at a local level in the

180
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,500
states open up and create more of that

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,600
over-the-counter access through adult

182
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,100
use programs and of course then that

183
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,199
started to mitigate and you know

184
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,460
decrease can of Tourism if you will for

185
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,800
patients in the migration of those

186
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,060
patients into the programs I think now

187
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,620
when we start to look at where it's

188
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,060
going into the future as it relates to

189
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,280
cannasuticals there's a very big

190
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,839
opportunity Gap because as we've been

191
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,119
talking about we're really looking at a

192
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,918
molecular and a phytocompound basis

193
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,899
we're looking at active pharmaceutical

194
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,939
ingredients and so with that and having

195
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,739
a cache of those ingredients we can

196
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,959
formulate new products we can formulate

197
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,478
new Delivery Systems and of course new

198
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,978
product formats so I think that as we

199
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,598
continue to start to see the European

200
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,800
market open and up going through the

201
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,019
pharmacies going through the

202
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,300
extemporaneous compounding process of

203
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,379
different methods of uh delivery we're

204
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,360
really starting to see more of an

205
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,659
emphasis on a strained a symptom and on

206
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,139
a condition to compound approach

207
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,840
I uh it's important to know that every

208
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,220
country around the world

209
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,418
legalizes cannabis for a different

210
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,940
reason

211
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:54,959
you have to understand the quote unquote

212
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:57,478
why why did they legalize cannabis was

213
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,060
it because of medical reasons was it

214
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,639
because of Criminal Justice Reform was

215
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,399
it for Social Justice Reform was it for

216
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,319
economic development this is the very

217
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,138
Cornerstone that you have to understand

218
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,240
as an invinced investor or operator in

219
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,460
this space because if you don't you have

220
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,259
no chance of participating in that

221
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:19,978
region that jurisdictions Marketplace

222
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:22,620
for example medical quote unquote using

223
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:23,939
that note that notion medical marijuana

224
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,959
in the United States has nothing to do

225
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,899
with medicine

226
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,538
medical marijuana means this is how you

227
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:33,899
qualify a purchaser they have a

228
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:36,418
condition that a doctor has recognized

229
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,458
it's on a list of conditions and that

230
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:41,579
allows that purchaser to legally walk

231
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,978
into a store possess cultivate or

232
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,440
purchase a cannabis product nothing to

233
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,240
do with medicine nothing

234
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,680
very different in Europe very different

235
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,480
in Germany as you mentioned it's a

236
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,939
pharmaceutical model

237
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,278
and here's the notion that I don't and I

238
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,640
can't wrap my mind around

239
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:02,820
the notion that in Europe

240
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:06,419
flour can be prescribed

241
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,360
as a part of a medical regime as a as a

242
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,740
as a medical solution never in the

243
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,120
United States ever ever ever ever ever

244
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:19,019
is the FDA going to sanction a program

245
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,820
or doctors recommend a flower no it's

246
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,959
always going to be an extract and a

247
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,240
formulation

248
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,619
so to have these models merge in the

249
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
future is going to be really really

250
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,220
interesting and again I don't doubt the

251
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,899
efficacy of cannabis for a second that's

252
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,240
not what I'm saying but in the United

253
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,700
States medical marijuana merely

254
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,680
qualifies the purchaser the last thing

255
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,839
I'll note is it is important to

256
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,838
recognize that the sandbox so to speak

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,060
is not just about flour and I've argued

258
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,360
that Industrial Hemp really is the

259
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:50,399
backbone for the Cannabis supply chain

260
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,278
the entire Global Supply Chain in the

261
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,120
world can be built from extracts from

262
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,139
the hemp plant it costs 600 per acre to

263
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,200
grow

264
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:03,360
it's less regulated and guess what it

265
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,459
contains the exact same cannabinoids

266
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,320
just in different ratios as a high

267
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:09,059
concentration marijuana plant

268
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,519
so then why would you go through the

269
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,679
system of registering a medical program

270
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,299
going through millions and millions and

271
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,579
millions of dollars of infrastructure

272
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,319
development when you can grow it for six

273
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,899
hundred dollars per acre

274
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,839
extract the compounds and create

275
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,059
formulations based thereon that is the

276
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,459
future and the more that we recognize

277
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,079
that the faster we recognize that and

278
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,639
you may not agree with this but this is

279
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,259
a fact I mean these are this is the way

280
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,899
the supply chain is going to develop

281
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,100
globally the more that you can get your

282
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,019
mind around that I think the better

283
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,120
positions you'll be as an investor as an

284
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,539
operator to to work in this industry

285
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,100
thanks Bob uh two things maybe to bring

286
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:51,120
up real quick that's looking in the past

287
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,860
the adult use versus medical uh one if

288
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,740
you know about Oklahoma

289
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,500
is crazy right so Oklahoma is a medical

290
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,600
quote-unquote Medical Market right and

291
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,879
the first year I think second year they

292
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,399
had 800 million dollars in sales in

293
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,019
Oklahoma and anybody that knows Oklahoma

294
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,200
realizes they don't have that many

295
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,820
people smoking pot frankly right and

296
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,379
it's meant to be a medical State and

297
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,760
most of that stuff's probably going down

298
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,980
to Dallas Texas

299
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,100
right so here's this Medical Market

300
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,778
that's actually more adult use right and

301
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,879
then on the other hand if you know about

302
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:26,039
the recent weed CARE program in

303
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,439
Switzerland if you don't you should know

304
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,120
about it because it's I think going to

305
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,640
be probably the model

306
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,379
of the future so here you have the Wee

307
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,379
Care Program in Switzerland which is an

308
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:40,078
adult use program where they roll it out

309
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,700
in specific cities associated with a

310
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,859
given University and it's under the

311
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,839
federal Office of Public Health

312
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,200
in Switzerland but also under the

313
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,880
auspices of the UN narcotics board which

314
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,060
is a big part of if you know the U.N

315
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,338
single Convention of 61. so here's a

316
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,500
adult use Market that's actually being

317
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,480
rolled out like a medical market and I

318
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,419
think that's hopefully maybe going to be

319
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,220
the model that hope works in the future

320
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,139
because I think as everybody here on the

321
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,060
stage will agree one of the big things

322
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,399
we need to overcome is the stigma and

323
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:15,899
the stigma needs to be overcome by

324
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:18,179
information intellect data and and just

325
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,820
a clear path forward

326
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,500
and medical studies I mean I think at

327
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,778
the end of the day we we put air quotes

328
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,419
around medical program but I think the

329
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:29,100
reason cannabis is so popular is that it

330
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,078
actually works

331
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,399
um and it works you know from my

332
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,739
perspective having run a chocolate

333
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,600
company a lot of people would not read

334
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,000
the instructions and they would eat the

335
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,300
chocolate bar that had you know anywhere

336
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,278
from 100 to 420 milligrams of cannabis

337
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:45,958
and if you ate the whole chocolate bar

338
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:49,578
you might end up at the emergency room

339
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,958
with a panic attack but you wouldn't die

340
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:53,638
at the same time you're doing that

341
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,819
because you're seeking some relief

342
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,839
whether it's the ability to sleep or

343
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,879
it's pain or it's nausea from taking

344
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,139
chemotherapy whatever it is Parkinson's

345
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,299
you've got some sort of a seizure

346
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,000
disorder people are seeking relief

347
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,919
because the pharmaceutical industry is

348
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,539
limited from the compounds that they're

349
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,458
providing whether they're opiates or

350
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:16,980
whatever they are and our body has an

351
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:20,099
endocannabinoid system and we actually

352
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,200
need this medicine and so I read a

353
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,720
statistic and it varies depending on

354
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,600
who's doing the study but approximately

355
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,778
85 percent of all people using cannabis

356
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,180
in the adult use markets are using it

357
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:34,799
for some medical reason that's why I

358
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:39,000
know this industry is not going away

359
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:42,179
because people want this access to this

360
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,120
plant so to Bob's point if we figure out

361
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:47,759
the most efficacious way to deliver it

362
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,879
to them where we can as business

363
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:55,200
operators have banking have marketing

364
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:58,078
and get people access to this plant in a

365
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,339
way that we can actually make money it

366
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,319
sort of becomes a Snowball Effect

367
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,180
because we can get rid of the stigma the

368
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,940
more people that have a great experience

369
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,259
with it where they don't end up in the

370
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,839
emergency room where they end up

371
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:12,059
sleeping through the night they they

372
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,100
tell 10 of their friends then they try

373
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,799
the gummy or they try the chocolate or

374
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,500
they try The Vape and right now it's a

375
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,539
global phenomenon it is an action

376
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,399
industry and in our lifetime I think the

377
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,819
only other industry that's blown up to

378
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,419
this degree has been.com maybe web 3 is

379
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,399
coming but we are creating jobs we're

380
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,860
creating economic development in a time

381
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,919
where we desperately need it so I think

382
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,940
there's a lot of factors figuring into

383
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,099
this

384
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,279
the only thing that we're fighting is

385
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,860
fear the governments are afraid

386
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:50,100
and Isis I suspect that that fear is

387
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,019
coming from industry that is challenged

388
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,420
by this plant so it's alcohol it's

389
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,919
tobacco it's Pharmaceuticals because

390
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,559
they're wondering well what's going to

391
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,120
happen when everybody has access to

392
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,559
cannabis they're not going to be taking

393
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,600
opiates they're not going to be taking

394
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,819
Lyrica they're not going to be you know

395
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,519
drinking as much alcohol and it's

396
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,160
actually playing out to be the case so

397
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,860
we're we're a dangerous industry in the

398
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:17,039
sense that human beings are going to be

399
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,019
using this in higher percentages

400
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,059
just just really quick just a quick note

401
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,740
giving people access to whatever

402
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,778
whatever way they want to access

403
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,579
cannabis is important because

404
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,500
over-the-counter cannabis when I walk to

405
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,778
a dispensary I buy a flower or an oil

406
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,039
that's one way to access it but it's a

407
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,539
whole other way to go to a doctor and

408
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,278
get a prescribed medication or a

409
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,419
formulation that's been going it's gone

410
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,639
through clinical trials and is

411
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,319
registered but all of those things need

412
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,879
to be accessible but that's your point

413
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,740
David is this is moving towards the

414
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,980
pharmaceutical model which is the latter

415
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,600
no one's walking into a dispensary

416
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,399
necessarily in conjunction with their

417
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,500
doctor they're going and getting a

418
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,078
formulation and and that's how you have

419
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,360
to widen your perspective and realize

420
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:58,979
that patients need to have access as

421
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,980
many different ways as possible even if

422
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,680
it's not a specific prescribed medical

423
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,959
use it completely agreed Jamie and Bob

424
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,879
and I think it has to be mentioned that

425
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,559
there's an onus on the operators in the

426
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,720
program as well no matter where they're

427
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,219
operating they need to understand what

428
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
problem they're trying to solve and why

429
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,459
they're trying to solve it in order to

430
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,959
be able to create the physician in

431
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,599
campaigns in order to be able to create

432
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,819
the patient messaging that closes the

433
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,339
communication gap between how this might

434
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,079
be valuable and from there what benefits

435
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,240
it's going to have for whatever malady

436
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,219
we're trying to treat and so a lot of

437
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,139
operators are running before they're

438
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,899
crawling and walking and with that model

439
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:39,240
they're not slowing their scale to their

440
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,799
sales and now the priority is Shifting

441
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,899
in their business model and how they're

442
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,639
executing on their business plan and

443
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,740
with that patients and Physicians get

444
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,419
left behind let alone The Regulators who

445
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,399
are still trying to understand all the

446
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,838
different nuances of this plant and the

447
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,879
derivative Products that come from it

448
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,740
and I was just going to say we're in

449
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,720
prohibition right now so if you study

450
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,759
history at the end of prohibition of

451
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,980
alcohol

452
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,860
there there was a lot of I would say

453
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,838
danger a lot of people rushing to get

454
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,979
where they wanted to be or to make that

455
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:09,659
cash grab

456
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,720
the interesting thing about this

457
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,400
industry is it's both medical and it's

458
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,400
recreational in the sense that people

459
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,860
use it as a social lubricant as well and

460
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,880
so you know when we're looking at all of

461
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:26,879
that is it a plant is it cpg is it

462
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,679
medicine it's all of those things and so

463
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,280
what we haven't figured out yet as an

464
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,860
industry is where do we land where is it

465
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,538
going to be able where are we going to

466
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,678
be able to give people access the way

467
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,379
they want it

468
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,140
so I'd like to kick it out to the

469
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,559
audience any questions somebody want to

470
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,559
kick it off

471
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:55,079
does anyone have a question just raise

472
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,019
your hand I'm wearing comfortable shoes

473
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,519
we'll be fine all right here we go

474
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,079
thanks for that guys

475
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,918
um

476
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,918
is that close enough

477
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,178
um my question is what has gone really

478
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,860
wrong in the industry that set us back

479
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,860
and what how can we learn from that and

480
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:16,918
how does that project us forward

481
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:18,959
to uh it's pretty easy yeah no that's uh

482
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,900
it's the start of attempt well so you

483
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,579
don't have time for that question

484
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,740
I appreciate that but like if you could

485
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:27,599
pinpoint a few key things that you think

486
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,640
have been really painful and maybe set

487
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,500
us back a little bit but actually in the

488
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,900
long run we'll take us further maybe if

489
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,319
you can use that word frame is the easy

490
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,059
one and this goes across all kinds of

491
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,558
geographies too much arrogance and too

492
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,639
little humility

493
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,379
so essentially you have all these people

494
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,299
that jumped in thought that it was going

495
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,460
to be easy you know growing weeds easy

496
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:52,379
growing really good weeds not

497
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,620
then you had you know the constellation

498
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,140
deal five billion dollars put in and you

499
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:01,439
essentially had campy growth put in

500
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:05,280
2018 early 2018 they bought a facility

501
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,320
in Lesotho South Africa or Lesotho 28.8

502
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,960
million they sold it less than two years

503
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,579
later for who knows how much right to

504
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,940
the people that sold it to them yeah

505
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:16,740
yeah exactly totally and and the fact

506
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,019
that you essentially have these people

507
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,519
that that think everything is going to

508
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,679
be uh

509
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,960
I mean you know for example one last

510
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,700
thing and I brought this up uh when Bob

511
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,100
and I were in Davos the one thing that's

512
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,080
been a huge Advantage for my firm is the

513
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:33,240
fact I understood that biological Supply

514
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,619
chains are inherently unstable when I

515
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,359
was doing recombinant protein production

516
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,058
in the early 90s we scaled up from like

517
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,558
300 to 500 liters and all of a sudden

518
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,359
this protein impurity we're making phase

519
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,918
one material this protein impurity came

520
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,359
out of nowhere and we had to figure out

521
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,799
a way to get rid of it and having that

522
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,779
experience and you're watching canopy

523
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,879
growth and Aurora and all these harvests

524
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,798
go from like 40 000 square feet of grow

525
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
to four hundred thousand and about five

526
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,619
ten years ago and guess what we're like

527
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,079
well that's going to effing blow up and

528
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,759
what what happened right so that's a

529
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,720
just a real classic I will kick it over

530
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,099
to my uh

531
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,200
colleagues

532
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:06,839
I would say the problem in the industry

533
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,640
is that the types of consumers that you

534
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,000
want to walk into a store and buy

535
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,400
cannabis don't go to stores because they

536
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,859
grow their own or because the laws are

537
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,019
so flexible that higher quality cannabis

538
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,119
has grown in smaller batches and you can

539
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,519
go access cannabis from people you know

540
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,678
versus walking into a store I hate

541
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,019
alcohol analogies but I would suggest

542
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,179
that the person that goes in and buys a

543
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,460
case of beer or a fourteen dollar six

544
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,259
pack of beer every couple of days that

545
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,240
consumer is not prevalent in the

546
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,640
Cannabis industry that's my perspective

547
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,380
uh I don't know Jamie you you lived and

548
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,900
breathed it I would I would say it's

549
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,539
misinformation and part of that comes

550
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,900
from the lack of testing that we you

551
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:51,179
know University testing lab testing so

552
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,480
we have consumers that are buying Indica

553
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,980
sativa and we know that indica and

554
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,779
sativa is really talking about the shape

555
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,058
of the leaf of the plant and how it

556
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:02,099
grows but it's kind of telling people I

557
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:05,339
might be Indica into couch I might be

558
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:07,199
Teva feeling up but the reality is we

559
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,720
all in the industry know it's terpene

560
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,840
profile but we don't test for terpenes

561
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,700
and oh my gosh we can't even start there

562
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,339
because we don't have banking we don't

563
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,160
have advertising what's gone wrong

564
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:21,959
we're it's we're in our infancy right

565
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,640
all we can do right now we're like

566
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,440
toddlers stumbling around bonking our

567
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,240
head on the table we we're making

568
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,000
mistakes because that's what you do in

569
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,740
your infancy everything's going wrong

570
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,659
I mean every company is going out of

571
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,279
business right like what else can I say

572
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,120
um yeah there's a lot that we could talk

573
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,500
about

574
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,178
um you know from my perspective I think

575
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,220
it's uh people raising a lot of money

576
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,380
and building a lot of shiny things that

577
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,700
underperform uh because they need to

578
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,620
show investors that they did something

579
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,120
worthwhile with that Capital but the

580
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:54,359
reality is is that they're scrambling

581
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,699
now to sell through the product that is

582
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,979
of poor quality in unmanaged

583
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,720
environmental areas that now is causing

584
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,579
deficits and what those deficits come

585
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,779
cutting Corners when it comes to your

586
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:06,058
extracts and when it comes to your

587
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,759
plants as well and I think that you know

588
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:11,339
a lot of ego has been infused into the

589
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,319
sector that is of negative consequences

590
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,699
and I think that you know companies have

591
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,139
not truly looked themselves in the

592
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,640
mirror to understand what their purpose

593
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,500
and their passion is for being in the

594
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,020
space and then what their Niche is what

595
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,759
their competitive differentiator is to

596
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,220
motivate a patient to buy their product

597
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,019
or to be served by their product over

598
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,659
their competitors and it's really

599
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:32,220
business 101. again a lot of folks

600
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:35,039
jumping in really quickly with a lot of

601
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,839
money burning it to shareholders dismay

602
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,460
and then trying to recover which creates

603
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,558
inconsistencies within that business

604
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,079
model and high turnover from your

605
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,399
employees to your actual facilities and

606
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,259
none of that benefits any medical

607
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
program or adult use over-the-counter

608
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:50,220
program

609
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,380
this is not an easy industry there is no

610
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,500
easy way to make money and so a lot of

611
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:58,740
people get in get chewed up get spit out

612
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,179
and leave so I I will say that I you

613
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,759
know want to just raise the people up

614
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,340
like Bob like David

615
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,440
ones that are still here

616
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:11,158
um you know kudos to you

617
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,058
so Rob Kyle I like a question

618
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,740
is there another question

619
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:19,158
oh there you go we'll go here and then

620
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,159
we'll go there

621
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,519
hi thanks very much for a very

622
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,679
informative panel

623
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,298
um I'm kind of curious because I come

624
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,038
from a North American perspective but

625
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,960
I've lived in Portugal for the last year

626
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,579
now so I've really started to integrate

627
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,759
a lot and I've been in the industry in

628
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:37,918
North America since 2009 so uh there's

629
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,379
definitely been a stronger focus on

630
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,360
medical here but we've also seen in

631
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,059
North America that a lot of the quality

632
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,819
and The Innovation comes from the Legacy

633
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:50,700
Market comes from the craft Growers and

634
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:53,158
I I guess there's this underlying fear

635
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,980
that I have that this focus on big

636
00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:00,120
Pharma taking over the industry will

637
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,159
stifle uh the small grower and in turn a

638
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,158
lot of the Innovation that we see from

639
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,020
the plant Germany's model with uh you

640
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,240
know forcing the different Social Clubs

641
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:10,740
to grow their own product could mitigate

642
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,740
that to a large degree but if we're

643
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,319
looking at a a broader European

644
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,359
pharmaceutical model uh do you think

645
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,740
that there are ways to ameliorate this

646
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,899
before we

647
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,359
you know run run headfirst into the

648
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,038
train real quick our perspective on the

649
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:27,359
Pharma is getting into this industry is

650
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:29,759
it's probably not going to happen if you

651
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,918
look at Pharma well it's going to happen

652
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,119
but not today I think people think it is

653
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,919
because if you really look at Farm

654
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,859
what's happened so the sandwich facility

655
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,600
which was responsible for Lipitor for

656
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,939
Pfizer Pfizer sold that off like 20

657
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,859
years ago 15 years ago Pharma companies

658
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,360
have been kicking off Innovation they've

659
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,000
been getting it from biotech companies

660
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,019
right and the problem too with Pharma

661
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
companies they're always looking for

662
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,519
composition matter coverage on molecules

663
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,100
to get that in these natural molecules

664
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,900
pretty hard so essentially the Pharma

665
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,339
companies and we know we've talked to

666
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,780
support you know we've talked to Pfizer

667
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:05,399
Novartis Lily Abby you name it GP has

668
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,500
talked to those groups I know Barbara

669
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,179
Dalton at Pfizer Ventures they still

670
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,159
supposedly say they're not interested I

671
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,500
believe they are but I think the other

672
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,780
thing is frankly the Pharma companies

673
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,919
come from a biotech guy and I'm sure

674
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:18,839
there might be some Pharma company

675
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,460
people in here but you know I think

676
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:25,079
we're going to be seeing more interested

677
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:27,120
in biotech than Pharma in the industry

678
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,699
I would say that they're not the same

679
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,259
industry a pharmaceutical company is

680
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,278
never going to own a dispensary they

681
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,679
don't want anything to do with it it's

682
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:36,298
not the same industry The Innovation

683
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,400
that you talk about from the illicit or

684
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,200
the Legacy Market that's for consumers

685
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,700
that purchase cannabis over the counter

686
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,400
a dispensary is merely an

687
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,159
over-the-counter dispensary access

688
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,919
conduit it has nothing to do with FDA

689
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,559
type approved formulations for specific

690
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,360
conditions so pharmaceutical companies

691
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,399
May own that they will own that

692
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,139
necessarily because it's a it's a

693
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,659
lengthy process that requires approvals

694
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,278
clinical trials IP protection and the

695
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,360
like but a pharmaceutical company is

696
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:05,460
never going to have anything to do with

697
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,918
the dispensary not here not anywhere in

698
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,798
the in the world ultimately those models

699
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,299
have to merge so that's why I say I

700
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,099
don't think pharmaceutical Pharmacy is

701
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:15,960
not going to own this Pharmacy is going

702
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,939
to own what they own but that's very

703
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,100
different than OTC cannabis which is

704
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,298
what a dispensary is that's all it is I

705
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:22,798
think it's it's

706
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:23,879
I don't know that they necessarily have

707
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,339
to merge

708
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,020
but they're they have to coexist because

709
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:29,339
there's two different models one is you

710
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,918
go to the pharmacy because you want the

711
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:34,139
cannabinoid as a an ingredient in

712
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,360
something you're taking for an effect

713
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,278
the person that wants to smoke craft

714
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,740
cannabis that goes as an

715
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:43,440
over-the-counter purchaser they are the

716
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,380
ones like I go into the wine Terror

717
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,179
sorry about another alcohol analogy but

718
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,360
the people that are really enjoying

719
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:53,519
cannabis socially that go and they buy

720
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,479
there are they do they want Merlot do

721
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,879
they want

722
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,220
um sauvignon blanc those are the people

723
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,679
that really want that craft cannabis and

724
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,600
I think both of those models can exist

725
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,278
and will exist because you're going to

726
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,658
have flower smokers and you're going to

727
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,278
have people that want to take a pill and

728
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,380
go to sleep and they're two different

729
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,119
consumers well it could be the same

730
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,340
consumer but they're two different

731
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,319
experiences

732
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:18,319
and God do we have a time for

733
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:25,259
this question that was just asked is is

734
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,200
a nice setup for what I was trying to

735
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,819
understand uh by the way my name is

736
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,519
Bernie sucher and I'm with Essence

737
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:35,220
investment which is a cannabis holding

738
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,579
based in Switzerland

739
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,259
um I liked very much David you're

740
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:43,220
nomenclature for

741
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:46,980
um for cannabis and

742
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,259
it clarifies things very uh you know

743
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,179
very nicely

744
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:52,200
but I was wondering if if the panel

745
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,980
could

746
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,740
using that nomenclature look forward a

747
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,659
little bit at on and kind of map the

748
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,519
supply chain that you and Bob both

749
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,980
referenced

750
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,960
um what are we going to be looking at if

751
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,480
we follow that logic from that

752
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,120
nomenclature and what are the business

753
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,940
models that as an investor and as

754
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,819
advisors you you see developing it it

755
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,919
suggests that at least for my first

756
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:22,139
glance

757
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,059
that most of the capital in North

758
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,038
America certainly has gone into the

759
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:28,918
wrong kind of business model

760
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,379
Rob yeah absolutely so

761
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,299
um I think that going back to my comment

762
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,340
previews for culture versus

763
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:37,400
commercialization you know when I look

764
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:40,500
at a plan I look at an ingredient

765
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,600
delivery system I look at a widget that

766
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,940
can manufacture compounds that I can

767
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,879
then isolate to formulate new

768
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,980
therapeutic kinesuticals where the

769
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,299
illicit culture grower the protector of

770
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,759
the plant sees something that they

771
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:56,278
whisper to and that is sacred and

772
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,319
frankly that's just not the case so what

773
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:00,240
we need to do is look at intentional

774
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,178
cultivation and crop steering strategies

775
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,859
in order to manifest certain compounds

776
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,798
out of these cultivars that are

777
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:09,839
chemotypic as opposed to looking at the

778
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,879
color or the aroma now I'm not saying

779
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,220
terpenes aren't important we all know

780
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,080
the Ensemble effect not necessarily the

781
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,058
Entourage effect of synergistic

782
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,319
compounds we've seen it done in

783
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:20,460
over-the-counter and in prescription

784
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,898
medication

785
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,880
but in going back to the previous

786
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:26,519
question as well I think that you know

787
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,500
Pharma is very successful because they

788
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,599
start with the patient and work their

789
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,000
way back cannabis starts with the plant

790
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,278
and works their way forward and so it's

791
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,740
not really the same process and because

792
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:41,339
of that it's falling short in delivering

793
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,259
True Value in a medicinal aspect so I

794
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,658
think that in terms of the Optics and

795
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,220
how you look at a process to give a

796
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,899
guarantee for the lifetime of the

797
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,120
payback over the patient over the

798
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:53,099
investor over the physician and over

799
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,199
that relationship it needs to start with

800
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,658
the patient first and not necessarily

801
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,519
with the plant going forward

802
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,399
agree more and one of the things I've

803
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:06,740
said repeatedly is we are seeing this

804
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:09,959
explosion of marketing Bliss sleep calm

805
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,140
because the marketing people recognize

806
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,179
when they do their consumer

807
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,340
research the people are buying the

808
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,559
effect that they want but it's a

809
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:22,500
disingenuous if you start with the

810
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,480
patient first you might smoke weed that

811
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,798
makes you horny it might put me to sleep

812
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,778
because we have a different

813
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,679
endocannabinoid system and that is a

814
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:33,359
fact because you're a woman well you

815
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,519
know then there's that on top of it

816
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,678
right

817
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,720
I always use that because I think a lot

818
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,860
of men buy cannabis that says Bliss

819
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,600
because they're hoping they give it to

820
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:43,918
their woman and something will change

821
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:46,019
but

822
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,840
we're buying an effect and we cannot

823
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,879
deliver that effect where every one of

824
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,038
us takes ibuprofen and it gets rid of

825
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,640
our headache that doesn't work like that

826
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:58,740
with just the plant so if we start with

827
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,659
the patient forward what we really need

828
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,778
is individualized medicine because

829
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,580
cannabinoids are individualized or you

830
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,619
have to use the ingredients in a way

831
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:09,720
that you can deliver that consistent

832
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:12,239
effect right now we haven't figured it

833
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,339
out it goes back to the lab testing it

834
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,319
goes back to knowing what we're doing

835
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:19,678
like you say it's biotech we're going to

836
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,558
get that Innovation from biotech but I I

837
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,480
will really maybe I'll you know in the

838
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,099
history animals 100 years from now

839
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,679
they're going to say I'm an idiot but I

840
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,959
really honestly think that that consumer

841
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,259
that loves the experience of smoking

842
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,538
purple flower or the smell of limonene

843
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:39,058
that's not going away either we know

844
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:41,220
that the majority of people who smoke

845
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:44,519
cannabis smoke flour it's still the

846
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:46,200
biggest percentage of the industry but I

847
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,879
think in terms of making money for

848
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,460
investors we've got to be looking more

849
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,220
at the pharmaceutical model so Bernie to

850
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,980
answer your question I I don't know that

851
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,919
there's a right answer for how supply

852
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,558
chain is going to work but I think if

853
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,720
Rob's point is accurate and if in North

854
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,058
America where we got to be shot out of

855
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,399
the cannon had we chosen a

856
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:11,339
pharmaceutical model we would have a

857
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,019
happier investors today two things real

858
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:16,079
quick uh with regards to the supply

859
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:18,538
chain uh is I think anybody would agree

860
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,278
that knows cannabis whether it's a phyto

861
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:22,740
source or a synthetic or chemistry or

862
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:25,259
whatever the the method that produces

863
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,359
the highest quality molecule at the

864
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:29,579
cheapest price is going to win out

865
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,740
whatever that is what and actually if

866
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:33,778
you guys stick around you know we have a

867
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,038
panel this afternoon in science and one

868
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:36,240
on cultivation where it's going to be

869
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,759
cultivated I think we're going to answer

870
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,038
both those one last thing is to Jamie's

871
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,658
Point there's a lot of genetics aspects

872
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,179
to this that we really haven't looked

873
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:47,278
into because everybody metabolizes these

874
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,080
molecules differently and my wife will

875
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,398
be the first one to tell you but I think

876
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,740
we're almost out of time but Bob did you

877
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,439
have any closing comments uh just what

878
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,058
we have time what's the future hold

879
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,679
um as I see it

880
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:01,200
um I mean formulations or formulations

881
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,298
supply chain wise cannabinoids the plant

882
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,038
is a treasure Trove of ingredients if

883
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,440
you think of it that way it's a treasure

884
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,819
Trove of ingredients what you take off

885
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,278
of the plant and you put into a

886
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:13,019
formulation that's the supply chain so

887
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,519
how does that transition into the

888
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,079
pharmaceutical World well that's

889
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,880
formulations based on specific

890
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,740
conditions run through clinical trial

891
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,080
processes which are available in

892
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,640
multiple countries around the world when

893
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,798
you look at over-the-counter cannabis

894
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,899
which again is sort of that current

895
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:29,940
European medical model it's not

896
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:32,099
sustainable because it doesn't jive with

897
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,480
ultimately FDA standards and where the

898
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,939
FDA is going to go with this

899
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,558
unfortunately and I'm not saying the FDA

900
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,240
is a great agency but it's an agency

901
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,339
that unfortunately is lauded around the

902
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,558
world and its standards will have

903
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:46,619
influence on how this shakes out going

904
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,778
forward so from an FDA standpoint it's

905
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,518
going to be isolated compounds created

906
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,898
formulations and those formulations from

907
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,940
a pharmaceutical perspective will treat

908
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:55,979
conditions but over-the-counter cannabis

909
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,919
supply chain that relies on flour and

910
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,319
extracts from that flower and what's the

911
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,480
future hold I mean we saw Germany's sort

912
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:06,119
of reversal of course with the adult use

913
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,338
program focusing more on medical that's

914
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,618
actually an interesting thing because

915
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:13,320
you never really needed adult use you

916
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,838
needed a more liberal medical model that

917
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,659
masqueraded as an adult use program

918
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:21,659
because of over-the-counter flour when

919
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,240
Colorado as an example had 100

920
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:26,639
000 patients registered it became a

921
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,799
commercial adult use system even though

922
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,139
it was called a medical system because

923
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,379
it had a severe pain catch-all Clause

924
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,940
that is a quasi-adult use system that

925
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:37,858
from an investment perspective it's

926
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,599
what's happening in Europe so instead of

927
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:41,579
saying let's go open up adult use

928
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,679
dispensaries and supply chain across

929
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,358
Germany and across Europe they're saying

930
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,760
well no let's invest in the medical

931
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,739
model and create a looser medical model

932
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,359
because it's really not a medical model

933
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,618
it's over-the-counter cannabis model

934
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,079
whereas the medical models of

935
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,700
formulation model that's not the end-all

936
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,098
be-all but that's my perspective on it

937
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:01,739
well the medical model allows them to

938
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:03,838
skirt the EU rules

939
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:06,118
to the world because right you have a

940
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,820
Social Club you have 500 patients you're

941
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,700
growing for them patience and then I go

942
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,440
buy my 25 grams of cannabis and I go

943
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:15,239
sell it to my buddy because that's

944
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,639
what's actually going to happen I mean

945
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,959
we know this from the Colorado model the

946
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:22,078
minute you have all of these social

947
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,880
clubs open up you basically and by the

948
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,839
way they also decriminalize possession

949
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,760
which means now I can sell you or you

950
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,320
know the selling is illegal but we know

951
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,800
it's going to happen right

952
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,720
give I'm going to sell you my lighter

953
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,940
and give you cannabis with it that's

954
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,578
what we also saw going on in Oregon and

955
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,260
everywhere else uh for sure do we have

956
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,240
time or

957
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,380
I have much more one comment regarding

958
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:49,259
we are discussing currently the

959
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,300
recreational medical way but what I'm

960
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,700
missing is that we have a lack of

961
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,980
knowledge about the plant and as long as

962
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:58,078
we are not solving this knowledge and

963
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,659
understanding how do we stabilize the

964
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,400
Genome of the plant how do we stabilize

965
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:05,219
our production that we have batch

966
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,260
consistency how we are defining what are

967
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:09,719
our deed compounds inside of the

968
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,480
Cannabis we will never come to a way

969
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:14,098
that we have really a standardized

970
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,380
reproducible product and as long as we

971
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,240
are not stabilizing this once we are

972
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,039
running in the situation that we have a

973
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,679
product which does not fulfill what the

974
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,139
market wants to see that's that work is

975
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,000
actually being that work is being done

976
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:30,179
um you probably know the most about that

977
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,980
but we absolutely have that now we're

978
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:34,379
definitely starting to see it on a more

979
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,079
macro scale which is very refreshing

980
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,180
because right now businesses need to be

981
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,339
more focused on what their brand benefit

982
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:43,199
ladder is starting with your product

983
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:45,299
attribute from there what the patient

984
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,980
benefit is and then from there what the

985
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,960
product benefit is and then the

986
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,719
emotional benefit and so if we actually

987
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,039
start to look at honing in on those four

988
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,739
different levels of the brand benefit

989
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,179
ladder and then in terms of intentional

990
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:59,279
cultivation and crop steering

991
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:01,500
Environmental Management AG Tech and

992
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,000
data analytics these need to be valued

993
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,338
in business plans and they are starting

994
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,260
to do so because it's no longer

995
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:09,838
acceptable for someone to anecdotally

996
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,060
say how therapeutically effective this

997
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,578
may be patients need medicine that is

998
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:16,500
predictable that is measurable that is

999
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,180
convenient that they want to take

1000
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,159
patient compliance on these products is

1001
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,719
very important too we've seen it in

1002
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,460
pharmaceutical models which is why we

1003
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,559
have flavonoids which is why we have

1004
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,599
different form factors for people to be

1005
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,639
able to achieve the therapeutic results

1006
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,740
that they want cannabis is now starting

1007
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,539
to embrace it because they're realizing

1008
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:35,759
especially in markets like Colorado

1009
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:37,739
that's very very old or Washington and

1010
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,940
California those models are drying up

1011
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:40,439
and they're not as attractive for

1012
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,358
investment they're not as interactive

1013
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,920
for scalability and so they're now

1014
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:45,900
starting to pay a 10 attention to that

1015
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,220
in some of our newer models like in

1016
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,900
Pennsylvania where they had a clinical

1017
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:50,519
registrant license where you partnered

1018
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,099
with the university we're seeing

1019
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,539
Academia start to embrace more in the

1020
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,579
research and the development of these

1021
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:59,579
products as well unafraid of federal

1022
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,780
prosecution or lack of funding which is

1023
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,000
where we're starting to see that

1024
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,220
opportunity Gap filter you're absolutely

1025
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,440
right that this gets back to my original

1026
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:10,559
point about the biological supply chain

1027
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,300
does not get enough respect so for

1028
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,059
example if you really know about

1029
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,740
cannabis it is very dependent on all

1030
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:20,759
kinds of growth conditions CO2

1031
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:22,739
temperature moisture humidity more than

1032
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,960
that right it's a very sensitive plan

1033
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:26,759
which if you vary any of those you can

1034
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,320
have a different terpene and cannabinoid

1035
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,079
profile the other thing that's

1036
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,338
interesting if you know Jeff raber who's

1037
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,960
one of the leading Chemists in the world

1038
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:35,639
out of Southern California he's done

1039
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,019
tests where you take the same Keem of

1040
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,118
our cultivar whatever you want to call

1041
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:41,099
it and concentrate it down in two

1042
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,140
different process same process whether

1043
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,300
it's ethanol butane and you end up

1044
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,039
giving getting different ratios of the

1045
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,740
cannabinoids and terpenes with the same

1046
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,358
team of Art so this gets back to my

1047
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:53,098
original thing that I've been saying for

1048
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,380
years when people are trying to

1049
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,000
establish Brands brands are built on

1050
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,160
consistent quality right that's what

1051
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,619
Coke made their name on and as your

1052
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:04,440
point brings up it's hard to have a very

1053
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,119
good brand when you can't control the

1054
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,559
consistency and the quality of what

1055
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,880
you're doing there's not enough respect

1056
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,380
and you have a good point that's what we

1057
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,480
need to do but

1058
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,680
uh it's interesting we're sorry we're

1059
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,838
talking about pharmaceuticals

1060
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,059
Pharmaceuticals Pharmaceuticals what's

1061
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:22,199
blowing my mind in the U.S right now and

1062
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:23,639
also in Europe is this th legal THC

1063
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,338
coming out of hemp and that goes back to

1064
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:29,400
Bob's point that you can grow hemp for

1065
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:31,019
600 an acre and if you do that and you

1066
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,320
are extracting things from the plant

1067
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:37,380
then you can formulate those molecules

1068
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,859
exactly the same every single time so

1069
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,420
when we start seeing the the legal THC

1070
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:45,059
coming out of hemp I think we're going

1071
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,980
to see an explosion of the University

1072
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:49,380
testing and all the things that we need

1073
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,179
to have that consistency for the Brand's

1074
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,700
sake the only thing I was going to say

1075
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:56,338
is this is not my perspective but this

1076
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:58,980
is a perspective of many of my clients

1077
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:01,500
dare I say the plants don't matter what

1078
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,480
I mean by that I I'm not saying that

1079
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,420
that's what I'm saying what I'm saying

1080
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,300
is the the composition of the plant

1081
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,700
doesn't matter because you're extracting

1082
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,500
a compound you're isolating it and

1083
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:16,500
you're creating formulations based

1084
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,559
thereon it doesn't matter what plant

1085
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,059
those compounds come from this isn't my

1086
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,759
perspective this is something that's

1087
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:26,880
prevalent so so I'm not saying the plant

1088
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,599
doesn't matter but that's the future is

1089
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,740
all I need is an isolated

1090
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,740
kilo or liter of

1091
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:38,819
CBD and then I create a formulation

1092
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,700
based thereon that is is unfortunately I

1093
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,099
think the future uh okay guys do you

1094
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:46,199
have a question yes I do have a question

1095
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:48,300
my question is so you're saying the

1096
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,980
future is just pills and chemicals and

1097
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,960
extractions and the future is not the

1098
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,820
plants on the Pharma side not the

1099
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,300
over-the-counter cannabis side where we

1100
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,760
talked about terroir and yeah I mean and

1101
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,039
that's the thing too and my other thing

1102
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,260
too was like is it possible like you

1103
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,539
said expanding so you're saying uh you

1104
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,099
know a set of colleges uh uh adult use

1105
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:10,139
thing it's a medical cancer dispensary

1106
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:12,059
which I think is a great idea and you

1107
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,739
can use that you can use the analytics

1108
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,599
and the people who buy the things and

1109
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:17,159
you can do surveys because I know a lot

1110
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,720
of people who keep especially in the

1111
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:20,338
early days who kept like a weed Journal

1112
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,259
oh I smoke blue dream and this is how it

1113
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:24,059
made me feel I smoked OG Kush and this

1114
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,760
is how I felt about it and you can use

1115
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:28,980
analytics to really get a feel for it

1116
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,220
and the problem of course we've all

1117
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,240
talked about it is a different uh the

1118
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:35,399
same strain will affect two different

1119
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,659
people too differently and also you give

1120
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,539
two Growers

1121
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:42,179
the same cultivar and you will get two

1122
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:44,759
different results just because of all

1123
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:47,279
the things so I think sometimes we have

1124
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:51,359
to leave space for magic and not always

1125
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:55,339
rely on this is how we got here on

1126
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,338
strictness and this is how we got here

1127
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,180
so anyway if you have a few more closing

1128
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,500
things we'll go to the second I don't

1129
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:02,219
know but thank you that's a good point

1130
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,780
and

1131
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,098
I understand it too uh you know

1132
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,540
especially here in Germany where

1133
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,539
everything must be so

1134
00:42:15,858 --> 00:42:19,380
oh no I guess we're out of time yeah

1135
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,240
we're out of time oh man that was fast

1136
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,940
let's hear it again for our fantastic

1137
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:26,449
