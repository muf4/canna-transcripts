25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,979
development director for Tallman group

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,020
who's running media today yakayej uh

27
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,640
let's give it up for yaka he's making a

28
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,640
lot of things happen here today

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,259
but most of all I want to thank you guys

30
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,478
because you're here and what are we have

31
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,459
a goal and that's to modernize cannabis

32
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,519
policy in Slovenia

33
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,919
and I think we all know in Slovenia what

34
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,560
uh some of the circumstances are or have

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,560
been in the past Slovenia has been maybe

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,978
a little behind on their cannabis policy

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,079
reform but that all changes now and it

38
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:58,799
changes because we are all here together

39
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:01,438
as an industry as a community pushing uh

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,700
this public policy forward so it's very

41
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,919
important that when we push public

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,719
policy forward for Slovenia that we

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,060
understand slovenia's sensitive

44
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,400
ecosystem that's not just ecologically

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,680
that's socially we're a small country

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,480
we're a special country and everything

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,159
we do has to be special so people don't

48
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,780
know that when they come to Slovenia and

49
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,020
everyone seems to be oh my God they

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,759
think it's uh uh some Outback uh Far

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,340
East Outback and here you come to

52
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,318
Slovenia and you get this and

53
