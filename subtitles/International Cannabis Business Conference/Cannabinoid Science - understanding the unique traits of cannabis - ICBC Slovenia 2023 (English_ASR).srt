ready all right we're going to discuss

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,359
canabo science we have a giant panel up

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,638
here and to lead us in that uh we have

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,480
biochemist a researcher from the

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:19,160
National Institute of biology in lublana

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,160
uh let's welcome Professor Dr Tamra

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960

everybody uh ladies and gentlemen so um

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,320
let me start with the words of Rafael

13
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:58,198
mulam who was already mentioned in the

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,439
previous lecture and uh he said that the

15
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,198
plant that had been used us for

16
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:07,478
thousands of years uh all around the

17
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:09,798
world actually uh from this plant we

18
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:14,239
discover a new pharmaceutical

19
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,680
pharmacological system that is um really

20
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,239
of immense

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,960
importance and so uh unfortunately he

22
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:24,199
passed away as we heard but a lot of

23
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,359
scientists research institutes

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,960
universities and Industry is following

25
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:34,319
his research because he is considered as

26
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:37,478
as a Godfather of uh Canabis science and

27
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:41,239
medicine so also this session will be

28
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:44,200
dedicated to uh actually um medical

29
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,118
research actually research science-based

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,600
uh medicine which is and it will not

31
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:53,519
only be on research but also how to

32
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,559
facilitate the research into clinical

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:02:00,718
application and how to actually transfer

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,320
this knowledge to uh people so um um

35
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,078
here in Slovenia we have a lot of good

36
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,919
scientist especially in Natural Sciences

37
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,799
especially in biom medicine and clinical

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,360
medicine but very few unfortunately for

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
several reasons that we are going to

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,959
discuss today as well are following the

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,800
Canabis Research or are focusing on

42
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,080
Canabis Research and that's why it's

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,120
very very slowly Paving the way to the

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,319
medical application so today it's my

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,719
great pleasure to introduce three

46
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:35,359

Israel and we can learn from him what is

56
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,238

usually with a series of seminars

65
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,920
organized by patients and activist

66
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,719
organizations of demystification of

67
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,158
cannabis it was very successful and many

68
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:44,799
people uh in the hall participated in

69
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:48,359

Slovenia to be at this uh convention

74
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,319
this is a great moment where we are now

75
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:09,479
so we should decide if we are going with

76
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:12,438
cannabis as a medicine or we should

77
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,679
continue to consider it to be a drug

78
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,599
maybe narcotic drug maybe dangerous

79
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:22,918
narcotic drug like it was established

80
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,160
for the last 80 years so uh may I have a

81
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,039
next

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,120
slide there is a matter of fact we have

83
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,160
a a lot of people that using can for

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,240
different medical purposes but what kind

85
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,600
of research we had been made uh till to

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,160
to till tonight uh almost zero uh just

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,320
for last 15 years we have some good

88
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,680
clinical research for some

89
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,159
uh illnesses and we do not have any

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,720
conclusive results European mediter

91
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,360
agency declared that they could consider

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,919
cannabis as a medicine probably after

93
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,120
receiving the significant number of

94
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,038
conclusive research but they never

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,600
defined what what they are considered to

96
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:11,199
be a conclusive research so the matter

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,520
of fact that the research in this area

98
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,600
is underfunded but we have some good

99
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,599
clinical trials usually had been founded

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,439
by the companies such as Jazz

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,439
Pharmaceuticals pre previously GW

102
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:29,160
Pharmaceuticals Etc so we are performing

103
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,160
a lot of clinical research for example

104
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,039
in

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,039
like you asked me and uh for different

106
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:40,159
disorder multiple sclerosis Parkinson

107
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:42,000
disease epilepsia H D syndrome

108
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,880
post-trauma post-traumatic stress

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,360
disorder do we have conclusive results

110
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,079
till not till now maybe not but we could

111
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,240
who could decide and who should decide

112
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,719
what is being considered to be a

113
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,280
conclusive results or conclusive

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,919
research another fact is that we we uh

115
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:06,279
now in the in the transition in Israel

116
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:09,680
we in transitional space uh perform

117
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,079
going from the plant to Med to Medicine

118
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,720
our Ministry of Health declared a reform

119
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,758
saying now we will have cannabis as a

120
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,560
medicine is it real is it for real how

121
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,479
we can medic how we can perform

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,199
overwhelming medicalization for cannabis

123
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:29,478
and cannabinoids because this is a plant

124
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,960
and plant does not hear the orders of

125
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:35,159
our Ministry of Health or director

126
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:39,239
General so this is a some facts and may

127
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,240
I have another fact another uh

128
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:46,399
slide so uh pH pharmaceutical industry

129
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,720
providing some good examples how they

130
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,758
taking cannabis to different directions

131
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,199
so they could use or canab drived

132
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,680
components or they can use different

133
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,840
side of components H making some

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:05,519
medicine like saix or epics uh B deriven

135
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,758
uh cannabinoids from the plant so this

136
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:11,639
is one of the answers that we have been

137
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,080
provided by the industry and now next

138
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,199
slide so we know that cannabis and

139
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:20,038
cannaboid compounds could be treat used

140
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,038
for different disorders we just need to

141
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,279
understand the nature of the plant and

142
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:27,519
how to adapt and adjust different

143
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,758
cannabinoids to the different patients

144
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,359
and to his different diseases some

145
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,639
patients has several diseases in

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,879
together could we treat them with the

147
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,319
same plant or with same uh canab based

148
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,319
medicine we do not have clear answer

149
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,800
till now but we are trying to provide it

150
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,280
in the short future next

151
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,879
slide and this is a Israeli system that

152
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:55,279
saying we are going to the overwhelming

153
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,319
medicalization of cannabis based on the

154
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,158
uh two system so they are looking for

155
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,120
only for THC tcbd ratio and also they

156
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:08,079
are looking for H Inda or sativa

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,478
predominance is it enough for to to

158
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,878
decide that now we do not have a plant

159
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,318
we have a medicine I'm not sure and we

160
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,879
suggest that maybe another system like

161
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,840
we called cooptation so putting together

162
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,720
cannabinoids and

163
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,679
plants together we could uh make a

164
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,159
cannabis plant as a medicine as a

165
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,080
medicine but medicine don't without

166
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:38,559
destroying the nature of this plant this

167
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:42,158
is our idea and I hope we have another

168
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:44,439
uh views in the panel and maybe from the

169
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,639
questions from the auditory thank

170
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,399
you thank you very

171
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:54,838
much so I will just uh ask you a short

172
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,240
question um responding to your uh

173
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,720
comment that you were actually financed

174
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,959
by the Pharma industry more than than by

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,278
the uh public health system or public uh

176
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:10,719
research um funds uh what do you think

177
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:14,039
is the future will we need the more

178
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:18,120
public research or the all research and

179
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:21,360
application will be um financed by by

180
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,320
the big farmer or the Canabis farmer as

181
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,759
I aware that uh National Institute of

182
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,278
Health in US funds only studies that's

183
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:34,679
that Target to negative effects of

184
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,838
cannabis only they who could only such

185
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,399
studies could obtain grants from

186
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,120
National Institute of Health

187
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,320
unfortunately this is why I and this is

188
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,078
a example how Public Health System

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,480
relates to Canabis and Cano research so

190
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:53,639
my my hope that private sector and the

191
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,759
companies and uh different consortion

192
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:00,120
could rise a good quality uh studies uh

193
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,278
that may probably will serve as a

194
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,839
conclusive elements to European

195
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,958
medicinal Agency for FDA Etc so you

196
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,040
think the combination or the cooperation

197
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:14,958
between the public and private um sector

198
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:18,480
will be uh public sector I I do not hope

199
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:22,000
for public sector in Israel we have all

200
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,440
studies uh that uh we had been made in

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,639
Israel they mostly of them funded by the

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,640
P private sector thank you very much on

203
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,278
that uh issue

204
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,399
will'll then try to explain how is now

205
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:37,439
how is now in Slovenia maybe you should

206
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,480
start later so Bor is a pharmacist as he

207
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,560
said he's a leader of uh pharmaceutical

208
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,759
biology at faculty of Pharmacy of

209
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:49,399
University of lulana so board please

Slovenia it is the leading one of the

215
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,958
leading uh member states in terms of

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
science and Canabis but unfortunately

217
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:08,599
the regulation is is still behind so

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,278
allow me to introduce myself very

219
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,200
briefly I'm professor at the facult of

220
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,480
Pharmacy University of Liana to link

221
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,639
with pharmaceutical biotechnology and

222
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:22,360
plant science uh beside I am unido

223
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:26,120
Senior um health expert in Vienna

224

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,480
um developing countries and very

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,039
recently I become a consultant for

227
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:40,000
Herbal pharmacopia at the wh uh which is

228
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:43,120
again a part of uh broad uh area of

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,278
research and you know plants and Canabis

230
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,959
and so on so I'm really uh looking

231
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:53,399
forward for these two I mean positions

232
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:56,638
and opportunities okay uh let me go I

233
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,839
will do it by myself so uh yes First

234
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,200
Steps regarding our group at the faculty

235
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:06,240
of Pharmacy dealing with Canabis you

236
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:09,120
know for for my humble uh experience and

237
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,919
opinion is that education is the most

238
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,159
important Point education at the first

239
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,399
not only for the health professionals

240
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:20,120
but uh predominantly for a native uh

241
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:24,320
individuals and patient as well as soon

242
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,159
as we'll be able to convince uh the

243
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,320
whole positive effects of Canabis or

244
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:34,039
compounds from a comination of their I

245
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,360
mean all these compounds uh to the

246
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,799
public this will be the ultimate goal in

247
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,879
order to make the final regulation so

248
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:45,039
okay there are many this kind actually

249
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,439
not only congresses but um I traveled

250
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:51,159
through all Slovenia and Croatia I

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,360
delivered a lot of talks uh among uh um

252
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:57,319
Nave and uh um public uh and some

253
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,360
patient as well and okay this was uh was

254
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,160
because I'm not active anymore in this

255
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,000
field in terms of Education this is a

256
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,799
task of my colleagues The Faculty of

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,679
Pharmacy uh regarding the Canabis

258
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:13,519
Research at the faculty of Pharmacy uh

259
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:16,799
we are Focus that means our group we are

260
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,000
focused on the analytical point of view

261
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,679
why because simply we need to

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
standardize material in this or that

263
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,439
manner or we are talking about the

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,360
flowers or we are talking about um okay

265
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,240
something's wrong I hope not from my

266
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,720
point of view but never mind so I mean

267
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:39,879
analytical point it is the focus of our

268
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:43,240
group beside uh now we would like to um

269
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:46,600
um simply to go further with the

270
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,440
research that I going to talk uh this

271
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,240
will be my my latest slide but now here

272
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,079
I'd like to focus your attention I'm

273
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,360
very proud of this International

274
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,758
dissemination together with Tamara we

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
attended at least two or three

276
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,759
conferences and meetings um around I

277
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,519
mean apart from the Slovenian um

278
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:09,199
territory but this one it was something

279
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:12,519
special why guess where is this country

280
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:15,958
that organized this very important this

281
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,000
Eurasian uh forum and this was in

282
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:22,439
Kazakhstan could you imagine in

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,480
Kazakhstan uh this was in 19 no sorry 20

284
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,320
uh 19 and it was under the patronage of

285
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,159
the thega newa

286
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,959
uh daughter of former uh president of

287
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:39,278
Kazakhstan n Sultan Naro so they were at

288
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:44,399
that time uh I mean they were really uh

289
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:46,600
focus on this point whether to uh make

290
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,919
Marana and

291
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,639
Canabis legal or is still illegal in the

292
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:56,278
country which is not the most developed

293
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,680
country and in the country which from

294
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:02,879
the economically his historically and

295
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,399
even um I don't know uh uh religious

296
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,439
point of view uh is something in between

297
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,320
so this was a very good conference and

298
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,720
here are some statements that I try to

299
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:21,040
uh Focus now I mean okay we are talking

300
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,120
about um recreational use and we're

301
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:28,159
talking about medical Canabis medical

302
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,759
use fine with me both but it should be

303
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:34,919
separated it by two different regulatory

304
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,120
uh uh guidelines or laws or

305
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:40,919
whatever it could goes in parallel this

306
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,480
is important to know it's not necessary

307
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:50,198
to be consecutively developed and this

308
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:53,720
is our ultimate goal to win with both uh

309
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:56,799
lows in Slovenia and uh very last slide

310
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,120
so yes now uh we try to find out

311
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,719
together with the Italian uh

312
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,000
partners and guys from Belgrade as well

313
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,720
what is the impact of CBD THC and the

314
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,198
combination of other cannabinoids on the

315
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:17,199
longevity or anti-aging if you wish

316
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:21,039
anti-aging is something that we would

317
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:24,159
all of us the more old we are the more

318
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:27,519
Focus we on this uh kind of or this area

319
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,519
of research and I was really uh

320
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,600
extremely positively shocked let's say

321
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,959
this was very fascinating keynote uh

322
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,360
presentation hibernation Canabis and

323
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:43,479
anti-aging you know that that uh

324
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,318
heartbeat of turtles there it is perhaps

325
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,159
12 per minutes the less heartbeats per

326
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:53,879
minut is present in the animal the older

327
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:56,159
in in terms of age these animals could

328
00:16:53,879 --> 00:17:00,000
live so I mean this is something that we

329
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,719
would like to to uh to uh re for the

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,119
research not only with the CBD but also

331
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,038
with THC and preliminary findings that

332
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,239
there

333
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,558
are under expressed of pro-inflammatory

00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,160
pro-inflammatory cyes and overexpress

336
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:21,720
genes that are directly or indirectly

337
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,720
related to anti-aging and by this I will

338
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,919
stop and I'm open for any kind of well

339
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:32,720
thank you very much U Bor um

340
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:35,880
here it's also my question because as

341
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,640
you all know or don't know actually the

342
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,919
Canabis treatment is very beneficial for

343
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,480
all uh diseases that are associated with

344
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,120
ages such a neuroen degenerative

345
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,480
diseases Alzheimer Parkinson disease

346
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,119
cardiovascular diseases uh chronic

347
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,640
inflammation also multiple sclerosis and

348
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,479
so on and especially cancer which and

349
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,720
all this increase exponentially during

350
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,319
aging so this is a very good news that

351
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,558
we can also use

352
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:10,639
canab both to prevent or uh to uh

353
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,319
actually slow down aging process at the

354
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,360
same time the associated diseases with

355
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,519
aging will be also could be also treated

356
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:21,240
so it's a big hope for that and I think

357
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,279
this is a very important finding and in

358
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,079
future you know uh we know all know that

359
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,519
longevity is um is a perhaps a problem

360
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,720
for some people but actually it's not

361
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,319
because what we want is to keep older

362
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,640
population active and healthy and

363
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:41,399
thereby contributing to uh economies to

364
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,600
a great extent especially this is called

365
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,919
so silver economy and that's why order

366
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,719
people keeping them in fit it's it's

367
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,240
very important so do you think that we

368
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,519
can perhaps use this then in Elderly

369
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,960
Homes or something just to you know to

370
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,440
treat the patients or diets or something

371
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,519
thank you very complex very complex

372
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,679
question actually yes but you know if

373
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:07,400
you are asking our uh medical insurance

374
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,400
uh companies they are not very happy to

375
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:15,038
pay for pensions uh till uh uh when the

376
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,200
individual is 120 years old so in this

377
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:21,679
case this is very uh an economically but

378
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,558
let let me be very serious yes I I

379
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,080
really believe on this actually uh our

380
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,879
foundings not only our but uh it's look

381
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:33,000
like that inflammation

382
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,120
it is yes inflammation it is one General

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,919
degeneration over the years and by the

384
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:42,239
way you know that obesity the new um

385
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,720
definition of obesity it is mild General

386
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,000
uh inflammation so as soon as we are

387
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,240
able to decrease not all of them but at

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,119
least some more the most important genes

389
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:58,880
coding for interl looking Alpha um then

390
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:04,038
uh 12 23

391
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:07,760
uh um 17 all these proinflammatory cogin

392
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:09,599
are related with um chronically diseases

393
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,240
that are present

394
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:16,519
predominantly in the older generation so

395
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I mean yes I believe but you know we are

396
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:23,639
all the the bottleneck is regulation and

397
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,319
on the other hand um we do not have a

398
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,720
very clear indications are the list of

399
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:33,240
indications that might be treated with

400
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,519
but perhaps this is the topic that will

401
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:41,640
this is the future the future of no B is

402
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:45,038
right person to Professor no b um he was

403
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,120
for 20 years the head of the pediatric

404
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,879
neurology neurology department and uh

405
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,359
now we switch from

406
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,679
older population to children and he is

407
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,719
treating epilepsy uh in very

408
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,000
successfully for 20 years and he will

409
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,640
tell you about that plus he will present

410
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,400
uh himself as

411
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,240
well thank you very much um thank you

412
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,960
very much Tamara for

413
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:18,079
invitation um and um I'm uh actually

414
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,079
professor in Pediatrics but also a

415
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:24,439
senior consultant in child neurology I'm

416
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:27,038
also visiting Professor mainly to the

417
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,720
Middle East countries like Kuwait

418
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,079
Bahrain

419
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,440
Dubai um but also to

420
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:38,558
Kazakhstan and Croatia and Zambia and so

421
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,558
on um I have just three slides three

422
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:47,119
different um um researches we we did it

423
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:52,359
in this um last uh actually nine years

424
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:57,079
that we are um uh using uh different

425
00:21:52,359 --> 00:22:00,879
cannabinoids um for severe um childhood

426
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:04,678
neurological problems the first one and

427
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,520
um the largest study we did is um

428
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:12,000
treating resistant epilepsies um in

429
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:16,079
children um resistant epilepsy that

430
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,839
means that at least two standard

431
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:24,720
anti-epileptic drugs are not um

432
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:29,959
successful and um the group we have um

433
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:32,919
taken are 66 children with severe severe

434
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,278
resistant epilepsies um which we call

435
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:38,159
now developmental epileptic and copes

436
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:40,558
that means that the child is having so

437
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,480
many SE maybe at the beginning the child

438
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:47,158
can be um normal completely normal but

439
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,960
he's having so many epileptic fits

440
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:53,600
epileptic seizures maybe even 100 per

441
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,679
day that his mental uh state is going

442
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,918
down he's more and more mentally

443
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,919
[ __ ] and even his motor abilities

444
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:05,278
even if his structure of the brain is in

445
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,120
the neuroimaging completely normal is

446
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:12,558
less and less and in these children we

447
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,558
used um first um canabidol it is 100

448
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:18,158
well

449
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:22,798
98% natural canabidol um and the success

450
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:26,200
rate was um extremely good it is

451
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:29,639
um this is not working but you can see

452
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:34,200
at the at the um upper part the seizure

453
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,720
free was in um 1/5 of the children which

454
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,640
is um

455
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:43,919
21% and in more than 50% the reduction

456
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,679
was for more than 50 um um amount of the

457
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,400
seizures no and um also in the others

458
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,919
there was some improvement um during the

459
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,080
study two children died because of this

460
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:59,038
severe epileptic and copies and now it

461
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,678
was um we started in 20 2015 and the

462
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:05,558
publication was in

463
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:10,038
2018 um however now we are treating more

464
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:12,558
than 200 patients with CBD um and some

465
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:16,240
of them they were those included at the

466
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:21,200
beginning so um the the the period is

467
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:25,440
now uh nearly 9 years of followup um and

468
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:30,519
um in some of them we um switched from

469
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:33,440
the 100% canab to uh cannabis products

470
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,798
um which usually our parents are getting

471
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,720
from the states this is haly Hope and

472
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:43,480
Charlotte web and um the results are

473
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:48,558
also um very good the second one um is a

474
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,679
recent um trial we did in uh severely

475
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,639
behaviorally changed autistic children

476
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,559
they're not having only the autistic

477
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:01,480
features but um the the main reason that

478
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:04,480
we tried this cannabis product uh was um

479
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,480
their behavioral outbreaks that they had

480
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,079
severe outbreaks of some sometimes they

481
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,839
were um aggressive mostly to themselves

482
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:18,079
so um self aggressive but also to their

483
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:20,798
um family so they were quite and um uh

484
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:25,759
we we were using the Cannabis products

485
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:28,200
which is um CBD THC ratio of 10 to1 and

486
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:32,519
the doses are up there

487
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:37,038
um we never go more than 1 milligram per

488
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:39,918
kg per day um according to the THC um um

489
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,640
do and as you can see the Improvement

490
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,880
was actually perfect in all the 15

491
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:50,240
children and um there was a lot of um

492
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,760
Improvement in their behavior in in

493
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,038
different

494
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:59,079
domains um the product was supplied by

495
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:04,038
pharmahemp um however um when we just uh

496
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:07,759
finished the study um the drug agency of

497
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:13,679
Slovenia um prohibited um um the this

498
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:16,879
company to supply us um and um we did

499
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,399
this way we did a kind of trial of one

500
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,000
study which means that uh each patient

501
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,918
um you asked the parents how it was when

502
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
he was receiving the product and how is

503
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,360
it now when he's not receiving and it

504
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,480
was Terri

505
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:34,398
so the parents were um phoning and

506
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,440
emailing me when the product will be

507
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:40,918
again available and we do hope it will

508
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:44,840
be soon and the last one is um the same

509
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:48,399
product we used um this is cbd2 THC 10

510
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:50,798
to1 um and the the doses are the same as

511
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:54,359
for these autistic children never um

512
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,240
going over um 1 milligram per kg per day

513
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,599
and these are for the cerebral policy

514
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,599
children these are the most sever

515
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,759
um

516
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:06,038
oops something wrong um these are the

517
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:10,319
most severe um cyber poliy children

518
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:13,319
those who are um bound to wheelchair um

519
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,000
and um the results are very very much

520
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:19,439
promising I cannot uh give the final

521
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,599
results because it is part of the PHD

522
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:27,000
study um of one of our younger

523
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:29,199
colleagues but um the the the spasticity

524
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,839
is much much less and some of these

525
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,480
children are even sleeping during the

526
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:38,480
night because they they couldn't sleep

527
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,440
because of this plastic seizures um and

528
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,640
the parents were also um um extremely

529
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,640
satisfied thank

530
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:53,278
you thank you David very much for this

531
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,440
also for marvelous work what you're

532
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,759
doing with children and how to you know

533
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,919
also help them and help the their

534
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,558
families but uh you said that you had

535
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:07,120
problems now with

536
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:08,480
regulatory uh actually with with kind of

537
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,398
nearly

538
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,120
prohibition I may say so in Slovenia the

539
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:16,239
situation and the restrictions in

540
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:20,278
regulations are very very very very bad

541
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,558
in terms of our agency ym which is our

542
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:25,720
public medical agency as well as our

543
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,839
National Institute of Health who all are

544
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,919
which all are um trying to really

545
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,158
restrict even in such a studies that are

546
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,799
so successful and so

547
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,840
effective well yes yes this is true this

548
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:44,679
is the um drug agency you know from

549
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:47,240
Slovenia which prohibited this product

550
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,360
uh to be given um further for the

551
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,319
studies and for the treatment actually

552
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,839
we did um clinical study know of this

553
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,480
treatment because they don't have all

554
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,119
they they had these analytic

555
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,399
certificates and I I don't know what the

556
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,798
good good product of growing the

557
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:07,038
Cannabis and so on but they didn't have

558
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:10,599
the the GMP they didn't have no this is

559
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:12,960
the last one uh yes this is the um good

560
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,959
medical product certificate which is

561
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,200
very difficult to be to get it and they

562
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,880
say at this Pham company which is a

563
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,960
Slovenian company that they will get it

564
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,960
may maybe within 2 years uh so um now

565
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,480
because we were um uh um without the

566
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,558
product for the clinical use because we

567
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,360
we wanted to do a short study or short

568
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,480
trial and thereafter to give this

569
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:42,000
children possibility to be treated

570
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:45,159
further no so we asked um the um company

571
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,720
abroad if they can bring us um and if

572
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,880
they have GMP product and they said yes

573
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,720
yes we do have it but still we had um

574
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,480
for two months or three months

575
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,120
negotiations with the drug agency it

576
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,360
seems that now now um for a short period

577
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:07,518
of time they will they will prove

578
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:10,479
um medical cannabis to be um um imported

579
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,839
to Slovenia so we can go further on we

580
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,519
really have a very difficult situation

581
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:17,398
and this has to change and that's why

582
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,599
also we are having this meeting here to

583
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:25,319
try to find the ways to facilitate the

584
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:28,119
uh the drug use in uh like it is for

585
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,678
example in Israel and how how is then in

586
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,678
Israel with the regulation compared to

587
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:37,559
let's say Western countries or compared

588
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:39,440
to Slovenia I guess we use cannabis for

589
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:42,440
medical purposes in Israel for the last

590
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,000
15 years it is allowed and the

591
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,679
regulation but the regulation is uh

592
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,480
unstable and going to the different

593
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,480
directions I already showed it in my

594
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,038
slides that U uh previously we had a

595
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,798
very good system where each patient uh

596
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,359
will

597
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:04,319
connected with some particular company

598
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:06,839
and uh he he has his cannabis uh

599
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:11,038
prescription each month that uh

600
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:14,199
permitted him to uh to buy cannabis with

601
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:17,440
different strains and how each patient

602
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,240
had a CH a chance and a right to choose

603
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,320
which strain is appropriate to him and

604
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:26,240
to change strains each month it was very

605
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:29,240
good system and uh it was a some

606
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,038
particular uh funding that each patient

607
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,519
paid by himself but the uh but the price

608
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,359
was the fixed for each each amount of

609
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,319
cannabis that was uh very difficult to

610
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:45,000
to companies because companies were

611
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:48,319
forced to subsidize cannabis uh for

612
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,359
patients who had more than 50 gram of

613
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,439
cannabis a month so now they changed the

614
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:57,199
system and regulation in Israel saying

615
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,639
that each patients and we now have 130

616
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,840
thousand active patients Vis A licenses

617
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:03,319
so this is the largest in the world

618
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,240
number of the patients treated with the

619
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,439
Cannabis per capita in the world in

620
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,798
Israel now and we so we are still

621
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,720
leading uh in this uh in this point but

622
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:17,679
uh uh each patient now uh has his

623
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,278
prescription for 6 months or one year

624
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,399
and he is going to the pharmacy and uh

625
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:27,159
paying much more than he paid before uh

626
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:31,479
approximate uh price in Israel is about

627
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:36,320
about 300 Chels so this is about

628
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:40,519
$70 per 10 GS is it much I don't know is

629
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:43,558
it uh expensive yes probably yes uh but

630
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,519
our our pay Patients First to pay it but

631
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:49,440
we have some several groups of patients

632
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,720
uh who subsidized for this uh uh for

633
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,960
this price for example Israeli army

634
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:59,480
veterans police veterans uh terrorist

635
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,000
acts casualties and uh um also gr also P

636
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,319
people who suffer from the work

637
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,638
accidents car collisions so they have a

638
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,319
insurance paying for for the Cannabis

639
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:11,918
and also for Visiting Physicians because

640
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:15,720
now uh cannabis now belongs in Israel to

641
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,960
private sector so um mostly most pres

642
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,159
prescriptions were issued by the private

643
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,360
sector now uh regulation is changing and

644
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,360
it's going slowly from private to Public

645
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,479
Health System and public health system

646
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:32,319
is UN ready to accept cannabis as a as a

647
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,240
treatment and then is not ready to pay

648
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:37,079
for it and is not ready to provide

649
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,480
doctor attention to these patients so we

650
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:43,720
have unstable regulation but the steps

651
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,480
being made by our Parliament and I'm a

652
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,240
senior advisor for our Parliament for

653
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,720
cannabis regulation committee for

654
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,079
cannabis regulation they making good

655
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,639
steps in proper direction so I agree

656
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:57,599
with them but the system the whole

657
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:59,638
system should be prepared to the this

658
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,079
and of course I agree with my colleague

659
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:04,158
that uh doctors should be educated

660
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,158
because majority of Israeli doctors are

661
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,119
standing against any can any kind of use

662
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:12,559
of cannabis they just do not see

663
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,838
cannabis as a medical uh medical use

664
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,559
they consider to be part of the

665
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:20,279
addiction uh program for such patients

666
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:23,239
so so they need to change their mindset

667
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,879
it usually takes more than 10 years uh

668
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,598
me and my friends we try we changed the

669
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:31,878
general attitudes of uh medical

670
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:35,119
community a little bit but we it took us

671
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:38,679
15 years now we when the Cannabis will

672
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:41,599
go to P from private to public sector we

673
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:45,240
will need another 15 years uh this is

674
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,119
what I think and uh but you see a good

675
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,559
head and I am optimistic and I wish that

676
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,919
Slovenia will go to the proper direction

677
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,398
learning from our mistakes and building

678
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,319
their own uh proper system that will be

679
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:59,598
applicable to your to this wonderful

680
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,160
Country and this people thank you well

681
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,800
thank you for this

682
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:08,679
answer and um education was already

683
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,720
mentioned by borut and what do you think

684
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:13,078
how should we promote education also to

685
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,399
the medical doctor here I see most of

686
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,760
the problem because they are not

687
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,639
educated they are not aware and they're

688
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,079
not interested so what do you think well

689
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:25,559
this is a very good point yes well we

690
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:29,480
tried in the past uh several time first

691
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:33,000
to start with the M this with the uh

692
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,880
medical professionals and I believe yes

693
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,599
uh particularly young younger generation

694
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,280
that uh they are quite open to this but

695
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,320
let me uh go back I would like like to

696
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,160
recall what um professor nobar said

697
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,838
about a um medical or drug agency uh I

698
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:53,719
am not player the advocate of these but

699
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:57,159
you know from the very strict

700
00:35:53,719 --> 00:36:01,838
pharmaceutical point of view uh all kind

701
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:05,118
of um um components isolated or

702
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:07,599
synthetic are APS AP means active

703
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,640
pharmaceutical ingredient and they

704
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,720
should fulfill all the criteria in terms

705
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:14,838
of GMP and so on so on so on but what

706
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:18,159
the problem is uh very slow reaction

707
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:21,719
very rigid reaction and our goal here it

708
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:24,679
is to boost to strengthen the system how

709
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:27,838
to regulate how to how to allow

710
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:30,679
regulation but first it is education so

711
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,599
education Hand by hand with the regation

712
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,078
and I believe that this is right time

713
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,119
now otherwise we'll be a member state

714
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,680
with the less regulated system in what I

715
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,200
think we already are we are at the

716
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:46,000
moment so it's it's way so what do you

717
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,759
think uh also about the students program

718
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,960
medical or your pharmaceutical faculty

719
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,800
they do they learn about that in sure

720
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,720
sure me personally I deliver uh two or

721
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:01,280
three lcons topics on the can Beno

722
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:06,719
Andoid system as well as um Professor

723
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:09,640
tamarak establish an um and sub uh not

724
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,598
only on this uh particular manner I mean

725
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:15,199
I'm talking about Canabis but in general

726
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,280
one yes and again uh younger generation

727
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:21,439
it is very open for this and as soon as

728
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,119
we going to have this one or two laws I

729
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,920
am for two laws we have to separate

730
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,720
medical use and recreational use

731
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,960
otherwise they will be a mess so when we

732
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:35,759
will do that uh with all this kind of uh

733
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,760
regulations and guidelines that would be

734
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:43,599
open open space well that sounds good

735
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,280
and hopefully we will um go faster than

736
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,838
uh like 15 years because you know we are

737
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,560
I just I I just wonder how you trying to

738
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,199
do it practically I because I'm a

739
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,880
practical physician I'm working with the

740
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:59,759
patients yeah so my patients coming to

741
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,760
me is asking how how much cannabis I

742
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,880
should use every day and I saying please

743
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,400
try not to exceed than one or two gram a

744
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:12,240
day according to your prescription so

745
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,960
but for some of them one gram a day it's

746
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:19,000
not enough and some of them would like

747
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,800
to have a fun so the first uh the first

748
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,358
uh half gram will be uh for medical use

749
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,318
and another half of gram will be for

750
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:30,920
recreation how you distinguish it please

751
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:33,279
no this is a real problem that is rising

752
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,200
from medical community they arise such

753
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,720
questions because saying we do not want

754
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,679
to play with a recreational why because

755
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,759
uh people could be addicted but we

756
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:46,719
should say them that only five to 7% of

757
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,960
people ever could be addicted and they

758
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:53,598
ever get addicted in each Society about

759
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:57,119
5 to 7% so we we should not encourage

760
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,000
any kind of addiction and I belong to

761
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:04,079
very very you know cautious and

762
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,318
responsible doctors I I'm looking for uh

763
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,240
mode of use of cannabis in my patients

764
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:12,880
because I consider them the safety of my

765
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:15,399
patients is a upst uh the goal and I do

766
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,880
not uh want them to be addicted but we

767
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,200
should be appreciate also they right not

768
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,760
to so the boundaries between

769
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:26,919
recreational use and uh strict medical

770
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:30,599
use are not clear so so yeah if I me IIA

771
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:34,358
is the same situation with um let's say

772
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,359
all painkillers uh there are limits and

773
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:38,598
you could be addicted of this of this

774
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:41,078
some opioids like fentel so who is

775
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:44,400
responsible for this yeah but okay

776
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,880
so good point but uh what we have to

777
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,358
have in our hand it is standardized

778
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,400
material first standardized material

779
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,960
patience are not standard okay a

780
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,559
personalized approach should be but

781
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,240
about abuse yesterday I heard that it

782
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,719
was a very good party uh there there is

783
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,719
a limit with the alcohol it could be use

784
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:08,480
or abuse uh so in this case you know

785
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:10,358
this is again education and tiation of

786
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,358
patient I believe that you tiate your

787
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:15,719
patient before to have to to to get an

788
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:18,039
impression of the optimal dose and so on

789
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:21,838
so on so on there we have devices that

790
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:24,880
could do instead of us but yes it's it's

791
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,400
an issue it's an issue it's a a personal

792
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,838
approach and how we would personalized

793
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,599
the treatment of the patients is that

794
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,599
the most important thing that who are

795
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,318
the patients because yeah of course but

796
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,318
how do you study that in in Israel we we

797
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:43,039
have patients that are very very

798
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:46,519
experienced users and they began that

799
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:51,119
this topic to be said aloud uh patient

800
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:53,199
who used cannabis uh and they uh even uh

801
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,599
provide us some education because nobody

802
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:58,559
educated us from the beginning now I'm

803
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,720
an educator but I educated myself and I

804
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,639
previously was educated by the patients

805
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,000
by the patients who use cannabis for

806
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,358
their medical reasons we so we need to

807
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,639
appreciate this chain who educate the

808
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:14,480
Educators and who provide us knowledge I

809
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:17,000
also was uh educated by master master

810
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,880
cannabis master class in cannabis by the

811
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,159
bedan in in Holland but but first my

812
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,680
patients educated me what is bad and

813
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,799
what is good for them and uh my

814
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:29,199
responsible approach is saying that I

815
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,560
should learn this nature of the each

816
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,960
patients of course possessing the

817
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,519
personalized approach but patients are

818
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,480
so different some of them absolutely

819
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:42,280
cannabis naive and we should very we

820
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,119
should take very care careful and very

821
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,160
cautious approach to them and some

822
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,039
patients are very very experienced with

823
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,879
different strains of cannabis and they

824
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,039
can't tell you whatever happened with

825
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,000
them when they are taking this one or

826
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:56,559
other one which we should different

827
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,679
approach to each patience and appreciate

828
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,719
the right to use medical cannabis for

829
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,639
their illnesses without preventing them

830
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,759
but being making it in the very

831
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:09,239
responsible way this is what I okay

832

839
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,800

yeah can you please talk about that

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,240
because you have a lot of experience in

846
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,279
oncological

847
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,639
patients we have a microphone for for

848
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,440
you right here let's hear it again for

849
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:03,480
the panel right quick while we get it

850
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,539
together very interesting

851
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,539
[Applause]

852
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:16,519
stuff uh hello yeah uh hello I'm at Cher

853
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,119
I have been working with uh with Dr CH

854
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:20,719
which is also my grandmother for 10

855
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,800
years in cannabis

856
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:26,598
research um so I'm not I am also a

857
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,359
doctor but not a practicing clinician

858
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:34,119
and I would have a question for uh Dr

859
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:36,078
Resnik uh in Israel when you have the

860
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,720
treatment of patients here I know

861
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,400
there's probably a lot of need to get

862
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,318
further Evidence about the

863
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,240
effectiveness because I would guess

864
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,358
there's also some push back from some

865
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:51,799
parts of the medical society in regards

866
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:55,000
to the actual effectiveness of cannabis

867
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:59,519
and uh I would like to ask are you are

868
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,119
the questionnaires uh uh uh like The

869
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,239
crucial part of following the

870
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,519
effectiveness or is there how do you

871
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:08,239
monitor the effects and collect the data

872
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,599
of or the effect effectiveness of the

873
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:12,358
Cannabis in

874
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,119
Israel thank you for the question uh in

875
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:17,838
Israel each Doctor Who has his practice

876
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:21,079
uh with the can medical cannabis uh use

877
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:24,880
his own system it is not standardized

878
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:27,400
and it's not randomized so my uh my

879
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,079
Approach is quas scientific approach I

880
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,119
use questions like quality of life

881
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,000
questions anxiety questions

882
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,160
questionaries but you see it is very

883
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
difficult to apply in the private

884
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:43,719
practice uh we do not have a govern

885
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,920
government uh adopted medical cannabis

886
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:48,439
clinics uh this is why in my previous

887
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,599
career I was I was scientific

888
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,920
psychiatrist I was a chief of research

889
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:54,559
in our Mental Health Center so I use a

890
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,079
lot of questionaries because I am very

891
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,559
familiar with them it is is not over it

892
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:02,480
is not a practice at all but I'm also

893
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:05,000
working for some British uh chain of the

894
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,920
medical cannabis clinics and there from

895
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,639
the very beginning we decided we use

896
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,400
questionaries in order to follow up an

897
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:15,318
outcomes and the results intermediate

898
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,480
results uh from Baseline to uh to

899
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:20,880
outcome uh so the the this is a very

900
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,119
good point to assess the quality of

901
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,440
treatment that quality of the

902
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,519
intervention using the Cannabis and uh

903
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:33,480
in late we will could have it as a

904
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:36,480
publication so we need to derived a good

905
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,719
Knowledge from everyday practice thank

906
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:43,240
you thank you if there are no question I

907
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:46,078
would like to actually at last oh you

908
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:49,759
have a question here uh I'm sorry yeah

909
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,760
his hand raise was so small I

910
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:56,079
didn't go forther uh I have a question

911
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,760
for all the speakers um what what is

912
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,920
your advice on how to connect the

913
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:05,440
slovenia's private sector with the

914
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:08,599
public health and um just to open the

915
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,200
topic thank you maybe you can answer

916
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:16,039
that well um I'm working in the public

917
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:19,439
health system so um usually we say that

918
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:22,318
um prescribing cannabis products is in

919
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,800
the hands of the tertiary care um

920
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:27,558
institutes that means university medical

921
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,440
centers in Slovenia have two one in Li

922
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:35,000
public yes one in lublana and one in

923
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:38,800
maribor and um we we do believe that um

924
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,719
it is better to stay within the public

925
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,359
health system and just to answer M um

926
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:48,358
well I'm a pediatrician that's why we uh

927
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:51,000
use questioners for parents now because

928
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:53,960
the children are too much handicapped

929
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,239
that they can fulfill it we use two one

930
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:01,639
is the PA SS which means parental

931
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:04,639
satisfaction score um which is very good

932
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:07,719
scoring system and very simple and the

933
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:13,078
other one is uh CGI which is clinical

934
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:14,519
Global impression CGI e cgii which means

935
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,519
um clinical Global impression

936
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:21,440
Improvement and at the beginning we give

937
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:24,159
cgis s which means uh Global um clinical

938
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,480
Global Improvement severity scale so we

939
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,199
just compare the beginning of the

940
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,719
treatment with this severity scale and

941
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:34,318
um at the end of the treatment let it be

942
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:37,598
six uh weeks or two months or three

943
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,920
months um the Improvement scale and you

944
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,119
will get very very nice scaling and this

945
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,440
is what what I showed uh like

946
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,760
Improvement now this is this is simple

947
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:50,159
of course you have others which are much

948
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:54,440
more complicated but maybe um this is

949
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:57,039
for for this um practical uh guidelines

950
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,039
it it is enough now to to to to give you

951
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,679
the impression whether it is better or

952
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,400
not so thank you very much I would like

953
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,759
to

954
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,200
conclude uh okay yes well um this the

955
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:12,400
last question I would not distinguish

956
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,759
between the private and the uh public

957
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,559
health system in terms of treatment in

958
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,200
terms of production something completely

959
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,839
different but what is important is that

960
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:26,399
individual um MD or the clinic is going

961
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:30,719
to go through a very uh uh strict

962
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,440
training before and to uniform to have a

963
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,759
a so-called National guideline not like

964
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,240
in Israel but National standardized

965
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,160
guideline in this case it really doesn't

966
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,838
matter that if the patient uh um choose

967
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:47,759
this or that clear I'm

968
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:50,159
sorry just one one minute we have a so

969
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,200
we so we have a so-called green book

970
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:57,078
that was written by by Israeli uh uh

971
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:00,118
Ministry of Health that this is a book

972
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:03,680
that uh produced by the clerks for the

973
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,760
clerks it has nothing to learn from them

974
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,239
it is uh speaking about imaginary

975
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,280
patients with about imaginary cannabis

976
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:15,199
uh uh so they uh they put the name of

977
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,400
Professor late late professor mulam as a

978
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,960
as a chief of the staff of this book and

979
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,760
when I asked him did he read the book he

980
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,199
said never never never never this is the

981
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,880
way so I agree with you that each

982
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:31,239
country should has its rights to to uh

983
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,880
to use canvas for the medical issues I'm

984
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,879
very sorry that uh providing it to the

985
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,119
clerks of the Ministry of Health it does

986
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,039
not enough because they are not losing

987
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:42,200
listening to The Experts they are not

988
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,759
listening to the doctors it should be

989
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,439
adopted to be personalized treatment

990
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,880
thank you as you said before so thank

991
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,838
you very much I would like to just

992
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,440
conclude it's not the end because at the

993
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,400
end I would like to present my work

994
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,159
myself and if you can just put

995
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,760
microphone please oh sorry if you can

996
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,519
just uh put this video because what I'm

997
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:06,040
doing is cancer biology and trying

998
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:09,119
different cannaboids in cancer and we

999
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:12,719
are working on two cancers breast cancer

1000
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,160
and the glow blastoma and so you can see

1001
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,879
the in breast cancer we study the effect

1002
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:20,399
of uh cannabinoid on the

1003
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,480
chemotherapeutic effects and there are

1004
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,318
either additive effects or there are no

1005
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,599
effects and this is very important for

1006
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,759
the clinicians to know if they can use

1007
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:31,039
cannabinoids along with the other

1008
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,640
chemotherapeutics the goal is that we

1009
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,759
will reduce the

1010
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:39,159
chemotherapeutic and concentrations and

1011
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,839
instead of that add more cannabinoids or

1012
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:43,519
maybe do not use chemotherapeutics at

1013
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,960
all because you all know that

1014
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:49,119
chemotherapeutics are really very very

1015
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:53,280
have very severe adverse effect and my

1016
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:56,079
work on uh our work on G blastoma we are

1017
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,599
using fresh organs fresh tissue isues

1018
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:02,039
cells and we are using different types

1019
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:04,039
of cells and spe specifically we found

1020
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,798
that the stem cells the origin of the

1021
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:09,000
tumor and the cells cancer stem cells

1022
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:11,559
that are more more resistant to

1023
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,639
chemotherapeutics are less resistant to

1024
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,680
cannabinoids and this will be shown in

1025
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:19,719
the last video that I'm going to present

1026
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,719
and please uh turn on the

1027
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,679
video the work was financed by a private

1028
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,240
company mgc pharmaceutical from has been

1029
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,318
fighting a long battle with one of the

1030
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,919
most challenging and fatal diseases of

1031
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:33,920
modern times cancer is still the second

1032
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,480
Global cause of death due to Modern

1033
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,519
oncology Achievements not all types of

1034
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,920
cancer are deadly but some like brain

1035
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,880
tumors called glioblastoma are highly

1036
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,920
resistant to therapy despite more than

1037
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,880
three decades of intense research and

1038
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,119
treatment approaches there has been no

1039
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,880
improvement in short the survival rate

1040
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,240
is about a year and a half on average

1041
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,760
National Institute of biology is the

1042
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:59,519
leading Slovenian institution in various

1043
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,319
fields of biological sciences including

1044
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:07,159
biomedicine at nib our cancer biology

1045
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:10,599
research team is working hard to break

1046
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:13,318
this grid lock and help finding the new

1047
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:15,960
more efficient way of fighting cancer

1048
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:17,960
our approach is to use combinations

1049
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,838
actually a defined combination of

1050
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:24,639
cannabinoids along with standard of care

1051
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:27,159
therapy protocols to treat most deadly

1052
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,279
brain tumor Alber stoma and to improve

1053
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:31,719
the survival of patients we believe that

1054
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,200
this is possible by our Innovative

1055
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:38,078
experimental approach using fresh

1056
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,279
patient derived tissues and cells to

1057
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:44,599
test this new anti-cancer combinatorial

1058
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,798
drugs in glioblastoma the researchers at

1059
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:48,720
NIV have been trying to answer the still

1060
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:50,920
open question which is the right

1061
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,118
combination of certain cannabinoids and

1062
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,039
in what doses to Target abundantly

1063
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,680
expressed receptors on the malignant

1064
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,960
cell cells this was found to inhibit

1065
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,838
glioblastoma and some other cancer cells

1066
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:05,519
Invasion and forcing glioblastoma cells

1067
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:08,159
to die having expertise in tumor cell

1068
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,280
manipulation and Analysis we are pleased

1069
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,118
to announce new research results from

1070
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,599
the ongoing pre-clinical research

1071
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,160
program that supports and directs novel

1072
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:18,318
cannabinoid formulations in the

1073
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,519
treatment of glioblastoma the most

1074
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:23,639
aggressive and therapeutically resistant

1075
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:26,119
brain tumor the winning combination was

1076
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:30,480
a certain ratio of two cannaboids

1077
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:32,280
canabidol CBD and cannabigerol CBG this

1078
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,798
mixture successfully eliminates

1079
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,599
glioblastoma stem cells most therapy

1080
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:39,719
resistant subpopulation of glioblastoma

1081
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,960
this process is called apoptosis

1082
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:44,078
so-called program cell death this

1083
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,159
progress was possible in close excellent

1084
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,359
collaboration with neurosurgeons and

1085
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:50,358
oncologists on one hand and partners

1086
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,199

development of cancer treatment that has

1105
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,720
been one of the most interesting

1106
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,639
projects mgc has been involved in and

1107
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:39,598
one that we believe in deeply further

1108
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:42,199
efforts we explore therapeutic targets

1109
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,240
within Goma organoids which are the most

1110

mimicking the tumors in patients these

1112
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,880
recent models are commercially

1113
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:53,000
attractive for the Pharma industry for

1114
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,680
drug screening that can lead to more

1115
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,159
efficient patient treatment we can offer

1116
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:01,519
a screening platform of 3D cancer models

1117
