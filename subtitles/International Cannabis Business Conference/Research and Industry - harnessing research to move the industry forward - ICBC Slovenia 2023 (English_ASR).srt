1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
so we're going to move right into the

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,139
next panel also this is our last panel

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,179
before lunch and when you get lunch

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,980
don't forget to get a chance to go check

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,179
out some of our exhibitors and maybe

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,719
donate to the Lions Club uh flood fund

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,118
right the ICBC is going to match up to 1

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,379
000 Euros so if everybody puts in a

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,778
thousand Euros we can drive Alex

10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,118
bankrupt all right

11
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:31,439
um which we shouldn't do because he

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,479
flies me out here okay coming up now

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,159
discuss harnessing research to move the

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,159
industry forward to lead this panel to

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,839
moderate uh he's a researcher at the

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,398
research institute and the faculty of

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,219
Health Sciences at the University of

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,219
Ljubljana let's hear it for Roman

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,189
[Applause]

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,859
so welcome to the panel about research

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,200
and Industry which I'm very excited to

22
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:15,840
moderate especially because if I

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,879
remember correctly from previous ICBC

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,219
meetings which were held in Berlin in

25
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,679
Barcelona there was a conclusion made

26
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,719
that cannabis Industries is one of the

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,659
last emerging and fast-growing

28
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,900
industries of 21st century and if we

29
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,020
just quick look into the numbers in 2021

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,939
the legal Global Economist Market did

31
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,399
more than 13 billion euros in revenue

32
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:42,059
and the legal Global hemp Market did

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,820
almost 4 million euros in European Union

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,960
the legal Market is estimated to be

35
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:51,478
worth up to 130 billion euros by 2028

36
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,059
and it's likely to become the world's

37
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,099
largest market in next five years

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,560
so we see there is a lot of money

39
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,599
involved in the Cannabis industry and we

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,540
who work in the research field we know

41
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,819
that research is all about the money

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,860
um and it's it is it is also known that

43
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,618
there is no growth of any industry

44
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,318
without developed in financial stable

45
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,900
research sector which can produce Next

46
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,759
Generation products

47
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,120
this and this brings me to my dear guest

48
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:24,419
panelists here we have uh four two from

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,340
Slovenian research and academic sphere

50
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,378
um assistant professor Andrea chernak

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,378
from Slovenian Institute of hop research

52
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:33,959
and Brewing Luca bitesnik from

53
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:37,139
biotechnical faculty and then we have

54
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,620
two companies bands are representing

55
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:43,378
Genesis and Clement from planze

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,780
and my name is Roman stukel I'll be a

57
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:48,959
moderator of today's panel and just to

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,759
Quick introduction if we can start with

59
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,979
the slides

60
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,299
so I'm a researcher at Research

61
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,340
Institute in the faculty of Health

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,620
Sciences where our main research

63
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,780
activity is related to analytical

64
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,719
identification and quantification of

65
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,300
secondary metabolites in the cannabis

66
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:09,239
plant and for this purpose we developed

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,340
a methodology and one year later science

68
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,500
still ongoing cooperational agreement

69
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,759
with our industrial partner research

70
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,979
nature Institute we have to say that we

71
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,560
our collaboration was very fruitful from

72
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,598
the start because we have a opportunity

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,658
to work with very International

74
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,818
prominent people from research field of

75
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:32,219
cannabis here on the picture you can see

76
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:36,958
Dr Hornby who sadly passed away last

77
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:40,500
year but you can also see a professor Dr

78
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,158
Ilya Resnick and also professor hanosh

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,180
um

80
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:48,359
our current activities related in in the

81
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,780
faculty are related to education we also

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,060
think that education is very important

83
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,120
uh in the field so together with our

84
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,060
partner we are organizing educational

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,180
seminars in our faculty through the

86
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,780
center of lifelong learning and in

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,459
approximately 30 days we will have

88
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,620
already a third edition and I would like

89
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,500
to invite all of you knowledge seeking

90
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,739
people to come and join us in on the

91
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,160
event we also have a credit points for

92
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:24,120
doctors and nurses

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,040
but our research activity is related to

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,639
a collaboration with biotechnical

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,340
faculty and also with Ben's company

96
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,340
Genesis in both cases we are responsible

97
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:39,060
for analytical support

98
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:41,219
but we also started to doing mapping of

99
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,560
whole Slovenian mapping of products

100
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,919
which were industrial and unindustrial

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,319
and last year we also had a privilege or

102
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:52,319
we were invited to show some preliminary

103
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,199
results in Ghana World Congress in

104
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,319
Medellin Medellin Colombia

105
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,819
okay so that will be from my side but

106
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,579
before I give the word to other

107
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,519
panelists I would like to ask one

108
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,959
question which I guess ask a lot and I

109
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,539
think many of you would like to know the

110
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,519
answer to I know Andrea and Luca that

111
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,979
you are working and your organizations

112
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,279
are the only one in Slovenia in the

113
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:19,319
research field who I mean research in

114
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,198
breeding who also have license to grow

115
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,060
THC strains for research purposes which

116
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,919
you will show in a minute and we know

117
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,259
the gene modification and genome editing

118
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,758
presents fear among many of us due to

119
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,100
the lack of the knowledge on any other

120
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,800
reason but for example breeders around

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,740
the world are already using uh Gene

122
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,560
editing to eliminate or nearly eliminate

123
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,879
production of THC in the plants but I

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,978
would like to know from you if your

125
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,560
research work on breeding also includes

126
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:50,579
any Gene modification technique

127
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,839
uh thank you for question we are in our

128
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,599
breeding program we're using different

129
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,819
biotechnology biotechnological methods

130
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,580
and approaches like different molecular

131
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:03,060
markers genotyping tissue cultures and

132
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:06,300
so on we are using also crispr for in

133
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,100
hop science but not yet in cannabis but

134
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,720
we are looking forward for these now New

135
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,879
York regulation which is focused on new

136
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,979
genomic techniques which will be

137
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,038
approved as I hope as soon as possible

138
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:21,899
great

139
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,360
yes thank you for the answer for the

140
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,698
question so basically the answer is

141
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,038
quite similar to Andreas

142
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,919
we don't

143
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:35,399
use anything for genome editing but we

144
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,500
use some molecular techniques for

145
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,019
support breeding so yes molecular

146
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,259
markers for sex determination or

147
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,599
genotyping but as I know there is a plan

148
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,720
in our research group to use crisprcas

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,780
on cannabis but this would be just for

150
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,080
research purposes nothing for commercial

151
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,599
okay so the moment you there is a gm3

152
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,519
plants growing cool it's always nice to

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,919
know okay so we will start with the

154
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,139
panelists presentations and after we go

155
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,818
to the questions first from me and then

156
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,538
from the public

157
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,539
so please

158
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,899
so hello I'm coming from Slovenian

159
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,300
Institute Institute for Hope research

160
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:23,159
and Brewing

161
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,439
since let's say the first relative cut

162
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,919
to cannabis is hops you can imagine that

163
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,139
we can use our Decades of experience and

164
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,560
methods and labs and all other

165
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:37,680
facilities for very useful breeding in

166
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,139
cannabis industry as well so I'm a

167
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,120
planned breeder I'm always a professor

168
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,660
at the University in Ljubljana for plant

169
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,319
breeding I have a okay I'm the first

170
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,939
author of more than 10 Hub varieties

171
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,460
which are also plant protected and we

172
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,860
have American Paint patent as well so I

173
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,279
think that we can really have successful

174
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,840
breeding program in cannabis as well

175
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,359
my two topics which I would like to

176
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,179
expose are one the first is more linked

177
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,879
to uh to varieties which are growing

178
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,120
outdoor so we just realized years ago

179
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,120
that in our varieties for outdoor

180
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,699
growing are quite different in between

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,399
the population so since there are

182
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,978
population varieties and in three

183
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,120
varieties Carl Manola selected and

184
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,959
Finola selection we found 11 different

185
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,220
phenotypes this is meaning that there

186
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,879
are they can be morphologically

187
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,918
different so our idea was that we can

188
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,799
find let's say a correlation between a

189
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,658
red vine and high CBD perhaps in some

190
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,819
variety and then can just easily we can

191
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,740
phenotype these plants select them and

192
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,339
have a new variety which could be used

193
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,600
for outbreak outdoor growing So based on

194
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,600
then we have done a different

195
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:57,539
analysis we were focused as you can

196
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,959
imagine on the main types components of

197
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:04,079
both groups and out of that base

198
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,338
basically based we then sequenced also

199
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,560
our some spots in the DNA from different

200
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,160
phenotypes and we use different uh so

201
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,599
genome sequences which are now available

202
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:17,819
and we were focused on more than 40

203
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,040
different traits we and we found let's

204
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,740
say correlation with uh High

205
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:25,579
correlations with perhaps THC synthesis

206
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,680
the gene which is mainly included in THC

207
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,440
expression so this is one of the PHD

208
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:34,019
thesis which is growing doing on at our

209
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,600
Institute together with the faculty of

210
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,000
so biotechnical faculty and the faculty

211
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,879
of Pharmacy as professor struckel before

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,539
mentioned and show our first let's say

213
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,519
scientific articles the next one is

214
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,039
we are very proud of that because this

215
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,500
is a completely a combination between

216
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,860
private and public sector so we have

217
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,639
very good cooperation with fitochemp

218
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:02,339
this is Czech company which is focused

219
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,679
on getting different products from a

220
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,140
cannabis plant together with as I

221
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:09,778
mentioned the University of for pharmacy

222
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:13,740
and farfermit the company from Ljubljana

223
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:16,799
so our main goal is to create new

224
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,519
new cannabis varieties indoor we have

225
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,799
allowances Roman already mentioned so

226
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,299
our goals in our breeding program are of

227
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,120
course high yield to centralized

228
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:30,059
compound compounds high THC and high CBD

229
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,179
our first goal is high THC so we are

230
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,799
working indoor as you can see we have

231
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,479
now few Generations we are using

232
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,759
molecular markers you can see for sex

233
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,980
determination that we can be as much as

234
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,659
possible

235
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,300
efficients we are doing our first

236
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:49,559
Crossings we have very promising first

237
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:52,019
results for high THC values and now we

238
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,419
try to also feminization because we are

239
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,959
trying to of course we have the variety

240
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:00,899
which can be sold with by using seeds or

241
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,359
water clones what is really painful for

242
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,000
me as my point of view is that at the

243
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,919
end we need to destroy all these perfect

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,980
material which could be really used for

245
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,799
different kinds of clinical research and

246
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,899
I think it was mentioned also

247
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,419
before from the other panelists that our

248
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:23,059
legislation needs to be let's say move

249
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,059
forward in this kind of work as well

250
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,919
so we are using different feminization

251
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,360
as I mentioned cuttings in Vivo then

252
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,879
also in vitro techniques for different

253
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,039
genotypes which we are using and we are

254
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,139
using our accredited laboratory for

255
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,659
chemistry at our Institute to determine

256
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,939
all these mentioned compounds uh before

257
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:44,399
so thank you very much and if there are

258
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,420
any questions I don't hesitate to ask me

259
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,419
later on thank you

260
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,139
please look at this

261
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,560
hello

262
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:06,778
um yes I'm working on PhD thesis I focus

263
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,259
on cultivation of

264
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:12,899
hemp and medical cannabis and I'll

265
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,519
present you our work in a

266
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,278
few slides

267
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,679
everything is done under supervision of

268
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,139
assistant professor Marco Fleischmann so

269
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,419
our best research revolved around

270
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,899
negative propagation and selection of

271
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:29,939
mother plants of ham varieties for CBD

272
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,919
production

273
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,300
we studied four varieties with 30

274
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,879
genotypes per variety

275
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,578
we evaluate the mother plant branching

276
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,338
using three different pruning techniques

277
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:46,259
over longer period of time we evaluate

278
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:51,120
the rooting ability of the root system

279
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:53,879
so basically how one genotype is used

280
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,578
useful for vacative propagation by steam

281
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,278
cuttings and we did analysis of

282
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:03,120
secondary metabolites based on collected

283
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:05,639
data we select the desire the genotypes

284
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,100
with desired traits and save it for

285
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:11,220
later research

286
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,800
now our attention is round two cannabis

287
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,139
grafting if you don't know what grafting

288
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,958
is this means conjunction of at least

289
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,120
two different plant parts together to

290
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,619
form a grafted plant

291
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,860
and

292
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,139
we are studying how different rootstocks

293
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,240
affects the science so how different

294
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,100
root system affects the upper part of

295
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,899
the plant so each the basically the

296
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,540
whole plant and we are studying the

297
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:40,820
morphology physiological parameters and

298
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,819
biochemical parameters of the plants

299
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,560
and right now we are also working in

300
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,838
breathing or we are breathing new

301
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,199
varieties we are working on CBG genetics

302
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,079
and CBD the ultimate goal is to develop

303
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,959
feminized seeds of industrial hemp so

304
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:00,958
for production in Slovenia we are

305
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:04,078
crossing for CBG the foreign CBG

306
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,059
genetics so they obtain new ones with

307
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,278
CBD we are

308
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,018
preliminary crossing the high CBD

309
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,458
genotypes selected genotypes with

310
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,980
selected

311
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:18,059
Industrial Hemp genotypes and the idea

312
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,039
is again to get a feminized seeds of

313
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,458
industrial hemp

314
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,458
thanks

315
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,139
[Applause]

316
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,200
I think Benson has video too

317
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,200
sure

318
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,139
uh hello hello everyone my name is benza

319
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,440
Matias I'm the CEO and founder of the

320
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:53,278
Genesis sfr uh it's a Hungarian company

321
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
let's say startup so four years old The

322
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,439
Innovation company

323
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,019
um we are involved in both upstream and

324
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,839
the downstream space utilization which

325
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,019
means that our basic research was

326
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,180
related to Mars

327
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:11,039
in in order to we were cooperating with

328
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,659
the jetpapers and laboratory of the NASA

329
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,278
if you know this department they are

330
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,799
responsible for the Mars rovers

331
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,259
development and many other analytical

332
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,778
technique in order to detect Organics on

333
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,360
the on the planet Mars so that was a

334
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:27,600
open call like four years ago and we

335
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:31,079
were at the Latin American station in

336
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,879
the Cotopaxi volcano a suggesting to the

337
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,359
jet prep person laboratory the most

338
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:40,078
viable analytical tool which can be used

339
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,180
for Mars research so we made our own

340
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,458
experiments in this world channels and

341
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,338
also other research groups were involved

342
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:49,319
in this decision but the choice was a

343
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,920
microchip electrophoresis based

344
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,959
instrumentations so when we established

345
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,219
our own first that was a spin-off and

346
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:01,919
after we make another entity in Hungary

347
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,420
we use the same technology this which is

348
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,698
coming from space for this microchip

349
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,639
electrophoresis microchipelectrove is a

350
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:11,879
really big family and basically it

351
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,620
serves nowadays medical purpose in human

352
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,159
medicine they use this for cancer and

353
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,320
diabetes too early detection

354
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:23,939
using mainly glyconic structures they

355
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,278
are free sugars oligos groups and we are

356
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,560
using it to get information of the

357
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,778
protein stress level before the visual

358
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,000
symptoms appear why it's important for

359
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:34,559
us it's important also for the upstream

360
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,559
and also for the downstream utilization

361
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,319
in the US stream because of that we can

362
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,439
provide a proper Health monitoring of

363
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,459
the of the plants and space

364
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,620
basically for the people who are

365
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,659
involved in Pharma business it's not new

366
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,100
that most of the big discoveries

367
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,458
happening in the International Space

368
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,139
Station especially in the Russian cabin

369
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:57,059
because the the big Pharma companies

370
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,459
sometimes rent the place for research

371
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,739
the researching was like one one month

372
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:04,740
basically we also get an opportunity

373
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,779
thanks to the huner Hungarian astronauts

374
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,400
program we will launch our own

375
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,039
equipments to the International Space

376
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,199
Station for two purposes one is for

377
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,740
human medicine and other for plant

378
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,380
utilization so let me talk about a

379
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,759
little bit about the downstream space

380
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,380
technology because that's why we are

381
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,980
here and that's why we receive this kind

382
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,500
invitation and opportunity is that we

383
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,240
are developing different

384
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,640
species-specific modules to detect early

385
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,140
stress in plants and the previous years

386
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
in the previous seven years we were

387
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,400
focusing on tomato

388
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:41,038
indoor application after we went outdoor

389
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,700
and we were measuring mainly Maze and

390
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,079
sunflower in over 600 hectares we

391
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,360
started in Hungary and now we are

392
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,000
expanding our partner programs in

393
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,558
Slovenia as well and since this year we

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
are new in this medical cannabis

395
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,980
business or our current project is make

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,099
a single run separation for 14

397
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,620
cannabioids with a portable device it's

398
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:08,219
a microchip electrophoresis device which

399
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:09,959
I can compare mostly for hplc which you

400
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,600
can use it's a liquid separation based

401
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,779
technology but it we don't use any

402
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,279
moving Parts in the device so that's why

403
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,440
we can bring it outside without

404
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,019
significant effort and calibrational

405
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,660
recalibrations these device must be

406
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:27,298
calibrated after every 5 20 000

407
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,419
measurements and also about the

408
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,859
manufacturers so our main line is a

409
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,538
glycanic research

410
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,599
um it's basically in the molecular

411
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:40,200
analysis and we receive information of

412
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:42,000
the of the proteins protein health so we

413
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,580
already started to build up our database

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,460
for the macro and micro elements uh

415
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:49,259
deficiency so we can compare these

416
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,440
changes in this glyconic structure

417
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:54,319
compared to that so the farmers not or

418
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,660
the grover not only receive information

419
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,399
about what is the element composition

420
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,640
what is the the element which was

421
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,679
uptaken to the plants already but also

422
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,080
they will have some reference database

423
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,900
and it also serves as a decision support

424
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,879
tool in terms of the leaf fertilization

425
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,160
and other terms

426
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,200
can be really useful

427
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,660
um in the indoor applications we are

428
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,279
going back to the lab because now we are

429
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,679
testing thanks to the the nature

430
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,960
research research nature Institute of

431
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,298
Slovenia thanks to bonjour we receive

432
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,880
opportunity to validate our Technologies

433
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:32,579
with also with hpsc methodologies which

434
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,400
is more well known in the analytical uh

435
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:38,399
industry so we are comparing our data

436
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,059
sets with the hplc results and also this

437
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,919
aim or aim for this series also get it

438
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:47,579
to the national standards with this

439
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,280
microchip electrophoresis technology we

440
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:51,960
have a kind of easy way in order to do

441
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,038
validation because this technology is

442
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,259
coming from the capillary

443
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,460
electrophoresis and the capillary has a

444
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:59,038
very well

445
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,720
um Publications I mean in the literature

446
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,579
is very well known and most of the

447
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,058
people

448
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:09,418
aware about this but the hpsc which I I

449
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:11,099
think is is in a wider range of of this

450
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,700
industry so with the microchip

451
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:17,099
electrophoresis uh we're trying to get a

452
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,460
bigger range of individuals who are

453
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:22,500
using it because of its sustainable

454
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,140
features I'm talking about the less

455
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,380
chemical usage we are talking about

456
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,140
micro liters per samples when we are

457
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,880
using also the other relegends which are

458
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,100
involved in the sample preparation in

459
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,559
the measurements are very low and not

460
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:40,079
talking about the energy usage like also

461
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:43,019
if you can compare a big machine like

462
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,899
hpsh on the table and compared to a

463
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:48,480
portable device it can be obvious that

464
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,700
the it has a really minimal energy and

465
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,400
and the chemical demand we came up with

466
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,740
a brand called Geno plant so at the

467
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,660
moment we have four modules on the

468
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,220
market for plantless search and now

469
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,200
thanks to a cooperation We are

470
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,620
continuing for soil measurements for the

471
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,660
same technology so we are very grateful

472
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,538
for the opportunity to test all devices

473
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,320
on this market and we already made a

474
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:15,298
great step already in this year I think

475
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,759
because of we started single around

476
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:19,319
separation of these 14 cannabis also we

477
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,900
are trying to expand our portfolio in

478
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,538
time of methodology and serving real

479
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,519
Market needs thank you so much for for

480
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:28,759
the opportunity thank you it's great

481
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,759
thanks

482
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:34,519
we'll move on with Clement and his

483
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,519
company planze

484
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:47,279
hello my name is Clemen

485
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:49,619
and I would like to present our new

486
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,200
technology that we developed for a

487
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,959
cannabis plant cultivation it's a stem

488
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,600
infusion system

489
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,000
so when my brother and I started a

490
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,879
company we were

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,839
very interested in how to increase yield

492
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,740
in cannabis growth so when we started

493
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:13,558
the the the state of the art we came to

494
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,839
conclusions that they're like so in in

495
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:19,558
the world people can grow cannabis with

496
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:22,619
crazy yields right now and more or less

497
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:25,980
it has plateaued so what we realized was

498
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:29,819
that the reason why cannabis cannot

499
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:33,000
yield more is the two main factors one

500
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:35,720
it can only do as much photosynthesis as

501
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,599
it can no matter how much light you put

502
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,640
that's one limitation and the other

503
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,859
limiting factor is that it can absorb

504
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,480
only so many nutrients through the root

505
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:48,599
system so no matter how much you

506
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,360
fertilize it will only absorb so much so

507
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,980
these are the two main drivers that

508
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,178
drive yield

509
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,279
so

510
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,100
um for this with this we we thought

511
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,960
about what if we were able to deliver

512
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:03,899
energy and nutrients directly into the

513
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,279
plant stem to avoid the leaves to bypass

514
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,559
the root system

515
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,220
so this technology

516
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:10,798
um

517
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,759
was done already on other agricultural

518
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,079
crops but with

519
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,839
reimagined it and developed it

520
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:22,319
specifically for cannabis cultivation so

521
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:25,139
it consists of three components one is

522
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,200
the infusions device itself that

523
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,000
attaches directly to the plant stem then

524
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,460
it's a pressure splitter because you

525
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,619
need to provide these nutrients into the

526
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,798
plant Under Pressure so we have a

527
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:39,538
pleasure pressure splitter so you can

528
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,599
apply this to multiple plants at the

529
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:45,000
same time and then we developed our

530
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:47,579
proprietary medium that contains water

531
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,460
and only compounds that are naturally

532
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:54,359
present in the plant stem so it's we're

533
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:57,298
not adding any chemicals to it so

534
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,839
um how it works basically after the

535
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:03,900
plant has gone through the vegetative

536
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:06,779
stage uh you so after it has been the

537
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:10,860
regime has been switched to flower

538
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:13,500
um you attach the the infusion system to

539
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:15,658
the plant and and you leave it on until

540
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,339
the end of the growth cycle it's in the

541
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,559
heart until the Harvest so there is

542
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:22,379
nothing else you need to do so the

543
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:27,240
device then slowly injects nutrients

544
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,240
over time uh through the uh under under

545
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,740
the pressurized system

546
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,599
everything else stays the same so the

547
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,640
flowering regime stays the same the

548
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,459
fertilization regime stays the same this

549
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,000
is basically an add-on to the operation

550
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,558
and what we found was that we did two

551
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,038
larger studies

552
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:50,158
one was with biotechnical faculty Luca

553
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,379
was actually part of that study we are

554
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,480
publishing a scientific paper towards

555
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,580
the end of the year from the study and

556
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,679
we did another study uh with a

557
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,658
professional grower who is also here

558
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,559
today with us you can talk to to him

559
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:08,100
directly also so where we looked at how

560
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:12,000
this technology impacts their regular

561
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:16,699
growth line so in both cases we were

562
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,759
able to show 25 percent increase in

563
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:24,679
in dry and wet flower biomass and we

564
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:29,640
just last week with analyzed also the uh

565
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:33,179
the cannabinoid content with hplc and we

566
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,100
realized that also the amount of

567
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,960
cannabinoids stays the same

568
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:39,298
proportionally so concentration of

569
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,140
cannabinoids stays the same or is even

570
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:46,980
slightly increased so in this in you get

571
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,900
20 five percent more flour with the same

572
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,778
or slightly higher cannabinoid

573
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,059
concentration so this can significantly

574
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:56,759
boost

575
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:58,700
the profitability and the production of

576
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:02,940
of uh

577
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:06,600
cannabinoids and and cannabis flowers uh

578
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:09,538
additionally we observed no adverse

579
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,939
effects for the plants so uh plants

580
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:14,339
stayed healthy they even looked a little

581
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,919
bit better because they had because

582
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,720
because they receive water as part of

583
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,759
their infusion system so they were less

584
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:27,120
sensitive to uh the watering Cycles so

585
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,740
they they stayed more upright throughout

586
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,058
growth

587
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,240
um

588
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:35,339
okay so what at this stage we are

589
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,859
looking to expand this technology to

590
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:41,158
more professional Growers so if this is

591
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:43,500
an exciting technology for you or you

592
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,080
are looking for ways to increase your

593
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,558
yield uh yeah please come and talk to us

594
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,480
we are both here uh we are doing uh

595
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,359
Pilots now with couple of organizations

596
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,720
so uh yeah happy to to do one with you

597
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,719
as well

598
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:00,480
thank you everybody for these nice

599
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,158
presentations

600
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,620
I think we still have time for some

601
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,600
questions from me which I prepared

602
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:08,699
um we will start

603
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,278
Andrea one of the main goal of your

604
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,840
project I saw is on the presentation is

605
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,819
to increase the yield and also the level

606
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,678
of secondary metabolites in the plant

607
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:18,480
what are the actually the main

608
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,000
challenges you and your team is facing

609
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,038
with your research group regarding CBD

610
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,740
and THC strains

611
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,679
uh thank you yeah the main thing is that

612
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,538
cannabis plant is quite heterogeneous so

613
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,220
whenever you're doing Crossings or

614
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:35,819
feminization you can expect different

615
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,740
kinds of plants but we have experiences

616
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:40,619
from Hop as I mentioned as well it's

617
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,259
comparable in that way all the other

618
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,899
techniques can be used as I mentioned

619
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,778
different markers which are available so

620
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,900
this is main thing which are we're doing

621
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:53,640
what is our let's say more or less thing

622
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,620
which I would like to expose it that

623
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,259
when we will have a let's say new

624
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:00,778
variety it's still not the legislation

625
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:04,038
so far in Slovenia that we could grow

626
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:07,079
that plants in under civilian conditions

627
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:09,179
which is strange in a way because from

628
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,879
the ministry we just get the info let's

629
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:13,559
say some time ago that in Slovenia in

630
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,179
general we could produce just let's say

631
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,418
a few grams which is needed in for

632
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:21,120
Slovenian patients which is a ridiculous

633
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:23,880
ridiculous comparing to that let's say

634
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,038
if we make a comparison we we are the

635
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,480
fifth producer of hops in the world and

636
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:34,259
we are exporting 98 of it so why

637
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,440
shouldn't we we be exporting country for

638
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:39,419
cannabis flowers as well so this is more

639
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,980
or less the thing which I'm thinking as

640
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:44,400
a breeder we will have very good variety

641
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,159
for our for course for our customer but

642
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,440
we could grow now they are preparing the

643
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,020
the places in the countries which are

644
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,179
let's say a few steps forward regarding

645
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:56,220
the legislation like Germany Czech

646
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,019
Republic and I hope that Slovenia will

647
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,600
be there as soon as possible I think we

648
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:04,259
will follow very soon you also mentioned

649
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,959
that you're trying to present I mean to

650
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,538
make a product from the partner in the

651
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,519
industry and I would to launch it

652
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:13,558
commercially so how do you assure the

653
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,298
standards and which cannabis products on

654
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,700
the market requires let's say from the

655
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:19,918
field to to the final product on the

656
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,038
Shelf yeah we have for this outdoor

657
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,278
growing we have jacp already certified

658
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,319
then we have a credit date lab and we

659
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,398
are in the process for getting GMP as

660
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,200
well

661
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,239
so we are looking for a few different

662
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,100
kind of Standards which are needs to be

663
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,278
used to and also we have ecological

664
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:40,379
plans and so on so we we are quite uh

665
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,940
well educated in getting different kinds

666
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,260
of certificates as well I think it's

667
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,058
necessary

668
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,398
um Luca you showed us a little bit

669
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:49,918
different approach that Andrea's team is

670
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:51,778
using uh the grafting of happy is a very

671
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,600
new method I'm not sure if the Growers

672
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:55,919
know it yet or use it frequently so

673
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,959
could you explain us what are the

674
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,480
advantages of grafting in hemp and maybe

675
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,720
what kind of benefits can we expect from

676
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,440
these grafting plants

677
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,480
yeah drafted plants can give us many

678
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,659
advantages over the traditional cloning

679
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,940
core by the steam cuttings

680
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:17,039
I will start with it's normally that we

681
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,278
have a genotype that is really perfect

682
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,079
it can have a not profile and all the

683
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,960
all the singles are metabolized but it's

684
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:28,139
near nearly impossible to regulatively

685
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,940
propagate it so it's a problem to to get

686
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,580
the roots of the cuttings so with

687
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,538
grafting this is really eliminated or we

688
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:39,000
can really increase the propagation

689
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:41,519
of selected genotypes this is like the

690
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,599
first thing I would say but we selected

691
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:49,500
rootstocks so desired root system we can

692
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:51,538
increase the overall yield overall Vigor

693
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,778
of the plant the plants are more

694
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:57,538
healthier the stronger

695
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:59,519
overall like the yield of flowers or in

696
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:04,558
Florida senses of square meter is higher

697
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,599
but with desires or some rootstocks

698
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,359
could influence the activity of

699
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,000
secondary metabolism which means that

700
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:15,798
overall yield of secondary metabolites

701
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,240
would be higher but yeah if the higher

702
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:21,298
secondary metabolism is present in the

703
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,880
plant means that from the start from the

704
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:28,940
start or even late in flower the plant

705
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,940
is more tolerant to pests and diseases

706
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:37,500
we selected root stocks some root stocks

707
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:40,439
are totally resistant to plant to so

708
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,140
important diseases and we can eliminate

709
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,058
the problems with pathogens great great

710
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,159
he also mentioned that you are Crossing

711
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:49,980
High CBD genotypes with different

712
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,659
Industrial Hemp genotype what is the

713
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,058
purpose of this Crossing

714
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,460
so we started from

715
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:59,278
old plants right now are on the field

716
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,140
like the really good genetics of CBD are

717
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,720
hot how to say like

718
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,659
the the federal limit is 0.3 percent of

719
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,298
THC normally on the field it's THC a

720
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:11,880
little bit higher than 0.3 our idea was

721
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:14,579
in the first place to to cross it with

722
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,399
Industrial Hemp to reduce THC levels to

723
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:20,038
0.3 that's a challenge I guess

724
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,500
yeah if you want to to have a high CBD

725
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,599
level it's really really a challenge

726
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,460
what do you say what do you mean when

727
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:30,619
you say hi how much

728
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,620
so above five six percent yeah

729
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:36,719
CBD okay yeah

730
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:40,079
um and the other goal is we saw it from

731
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,538
the field that many farmers cut the the

732
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,278
plants down early in the end of the

733
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:46,398
season because of wet bad weather

734
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,319
conditions because

735
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:52,379
normally really good genotypes of CBD

736
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:55,019
mature late and

737
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,320
okay now our idea is now to

738
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:59,639
produce a faster flowering strain

739
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,339
to

740
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,559
to obtain variety that could be Harvest

741
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:08,579
early in the autumn

742
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:10,500
okay nice uh Ben said

743
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:12,839
we'll move now to you so you're

744
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,519
developing with some microfluidics and

745
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:17,459
you also mentioned that you are

746
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,679
cooperating with European Space Agency

747
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,840
uh but tell us how is your technology

748
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,659
also applicable in the space and since

749
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,538
we have two breeders here on the panel

750
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,640
how can you transfer your methodology to

751
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:33,359
the grower or breeder

752
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:36,059
a question and we highlight in in the

753
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,398
video in this this portable feature with

754
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:39,058
the with the space research because yeah

755
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,518
um

756
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,579
why it can be used in some remote places

757
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,140
and in microgravity uh because of the

758
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:48,058
capillaries so all of the separation

759
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,038
happens in capillaries so we don't have

760
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:53,819
to like generate artificial gravity or

761
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:56,099
or that's why the the selection was you

762
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:57,538
know narrow to the microchip electrical

763
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,558
phrases development so that's why the

764
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:03,058
space research it could be also

765
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,158
passively working with HPS because it's

766
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,980
also you know like liquid separation but

767
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,480
there's much more moving parts and you

768
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,740
know it's much more complicated to to

769
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,838
set it up in the International Space

770
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:17,779
Station so that's why the microchip

771
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,779
collector phrase is so about the black

772
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:56,699
the laboratory or their own Plantation

773
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,460
and they want to have measurements on

774
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:01,500
the field without like hiring some

775
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,320
experts yeah

776
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,059
yeah okay maybe a second question from

777
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,700
the analytical point of view which I'm

778
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:12,719
much closer to so we know that cannabis

779
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:15,059
plant has a long THC CBD and CBG also

780
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,578
present many minor cannabinoids which

781
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,920
occasionally present challenge to detect

782
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:21,539
them or identify them so my question

783
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,539
would be about the sensitivity and

784
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:26,880
accuracy of your device and what are the

785
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:30,119
actual benefits as you already said a

786
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,920
few of them for the user oh yeah uh it's

787
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:34,320
because if it's an analytical technique

788
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,659
like the accuracy can be comparable to

789
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,160
HPS or even a little bit but you know

790
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,719
it's hard to explain because that svr

791
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,940
comparing pixels to theoretical plate

792
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,219
numbers but we are talking about exact

793
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,858
matches on four decimal

794
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:50,338
um let's see in hplc case where and the

795
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:52,858
peak area is also um the the repeated

796
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:55,619
Peak area the differences of derivative

797
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:57,980
Peak area determining the accuracy so we

798
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:02,460
are in the LOD we are talking about

799
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:06,440
vam in the kanabits between 1.1 to 1.7

800
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,720
started with a CBD to the THC

801
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,780
microgram per milliliter so yeah it's

802
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:14,819
like a six decimal uh error margin yeah

803
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,119
and the matches are four decimals okay

804
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,519
okay thank you uh Clemen

805
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,320
um your technology technology which you

806
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,460
are developing is a steam infusion for

807
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,220
the plants which is in a way

808
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,559
biostimulant but as a grower I would be

809
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,779
very interested in the financial scheme

810
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,000
when using your technology

811
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,660
we know that probably industrial Growers

812
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,659
usually have

813
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,899
finances and they have money but what

814
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,159
about home grower can they afford your

815
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,358
technology

816
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:47,879
yeah so uh to calculate the let's say

817
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,819
the return on investment of this

818
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,960
technology we use the two examples like

819
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,760
maybe the first example is uh using an

820
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,199
uh

821
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,540
from the numbers uh larger German

822
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:06,659
grower of medical cannabis that has

823
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:09,599
let's say more than thousand plants uh

824
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:14,519
selling let's say the final product at

825
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:18,720
the German average gross price we showed

826
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:20,400
that the return on investment is uh a

827
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,759
hundred percent so what this means is

828
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,039
that for every uh Euro that they put

829
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,280
into the device and the medium and the

830
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:31,079
technology they get two Euros back in

831
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,619
the first growth cycle

832
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:38,099
so the return on investment is pretty

833
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:41,280
rapid as the 25 percent increase in

834
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:43,619
yield is quite a lot it's different for

835
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,820
CBD there because of the price of the

836
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:48,680
flower

837
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,900
um it's uh the the the return is slower

838
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:54,480
for the home Growers so our device is

839
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,599
completely modular so you can use it

840
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,519
from one day one pla growing one plant

841
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,579
to Growing hundreds of thousands of

842
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:05,039
plants uh the device is stack so

843
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:08,760
basically connect it's the same device

844
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:11,338
it's just connected to to form large

845
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:15,540
chains

846
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:18,440
so for home Growers they are usually

847
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:20,940
um so the the calculation is actually

848
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:25,079
using different numbers in the end is

849
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,700
very similar because they uh um they

850
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,240
typically if they are looking to sell

851
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:33,419
they sell for a larger price than what

852
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,299
the German average gross price for large

853
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,400
manufacturers

854
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:41,039
of course for them just having one

855
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,559
system is the price is also higher but

856
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,779
but we always say when we are developing

857
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,299
this technology is that there should be

858
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,940
one growth cycle that pays off for the

859
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,680
investment and uh yeah so far for

860
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,599
medical we were able to so it's

861
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,279
mentioned for everybody even for the

862
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,099
single but did you mention the price

863
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,160
what's the price of the depending on the

864
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,980
size but typically so for uh the for one

865
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:09,179
cartridge that is used for one plant for

866
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:12,659
one growth cycle is 20 Euro uh that's if

867
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:15,000
you just buy one but then you also need

868
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:17,219
to have the device so the system the

869
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,300
pressurized system this is a one-time

870
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:24,598
investment that then lasts for for yeah

871
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,099
for many growth Cycles okay thank you so

872
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,039
I think we are ready for the questions

873
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:30,420
from the public if there is a time for

874
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,639
maybe one or two questions because

875
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,920
everybody is hungry or do does anyone

876
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,199
have question

877
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,559
hunger is outweighing your need for

878
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,559
knowledge

879
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,960
