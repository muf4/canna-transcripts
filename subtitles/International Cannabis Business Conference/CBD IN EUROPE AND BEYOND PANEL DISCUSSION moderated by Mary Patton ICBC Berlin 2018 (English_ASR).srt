psychoactive cannabinoid in the plant

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,910
it's been the most famous one but CBD is

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,179
really helping lead the way

I call my company in Utopia because like

27
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,259
you I always believe that a legal

28
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:11,289
cannabis marketplace would make the

29
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:14,049
world a better place but today I am

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,420

31
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:19,329

that's an exploding sector you know I

34
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:29,618
was looking at some of the statistics

35
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:32,078
recently and you know back in 2010 Jared

36
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:34,899
do you remember we were trying to get

37
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,758
the CBD industry off to a start and

38
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:40,118
everybody thought we were completely

39
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,519
crazy but now I was looking at

40
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:44,828
statistics and by some industry experts

41
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,349
are anticipating that this is going to

42
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:51,399
be a three billion dollar industry just

43
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:54,269

64
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,729
Bancorporation were one of the the

65
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,550
larger brands in the United States we

66
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:56,409
have a presence in California Washington

67
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,790
New Mexico Illinois Florida Puerto Rico

68
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,669
Uruguay I could go on and on and what I

69
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:04,400
do is I'm in charge of global operations

70
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:07,189
we are here to connect with Europe and

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,050
specifically to bring our finished CBD

72
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:13,099
goods to Europe we have full spectrum

73
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:16,660
CBD and CBD isolate products in the form

74

of gourmet chocolate in vapes in gum

75
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:22,489
mouth sprays a whole array of products

76
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,169
and we sell them to the goals handle so

77
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,719
we're more of a wholesaler rather than a

78
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:28,250
retailer and that's what I'm here for us

79
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,650
to connect with people from the EU who

80
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,620
are looking for finished CBD goods but

81
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,430
we also import bulk CBD so that's what

82
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,469
I'm doing here thank you thank you

83
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,629
excellent my name is Jared berry and

84
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:47,479
actually bang was the first sale we made

85
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,789
of CBD was a million dollar sale in 2011

86
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,768
and this is again when Mary said people

87
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:53,919
thought we were crazy that was a big

88
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:56,390
leap for your the owner of being to take

89
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,849
people thought why would anybody want

90
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,379
CBD it doesn't even get you high and I

91
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,358
remember every investor me went to that

92
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,280
was the first thing they'd say but look

93
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,140
at it now and it really is incredible

94
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,400
not only the industry and how its

95
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,229
booming and the amount of people that

96
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,090
are getting into the industry and able

97
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,199
to make a good living and then do

98
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,430
something that's exciting because it

99
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,349
really does make a difference in

100
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,689
people's lives we see it every day with

101
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,480
testimonials coming in on humans and

102
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:21,019
animals and you know my story starts

103
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,780
back

104
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,819
2009 with a company called canna bank

105
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,799
and we did a reverse merger with Medical

106
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:31,220
Marijuana Inc it was there that I

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,098
discovered that CBD may be an incredible

108
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,330
molecule just through some patents at

109
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:38,659
the United States Health Department had

110
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:40,370
pulled and so I left there and started a

111
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,650
company called bio synthesis a farmer

112
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,389
group ESP G which is actually here in

113
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,329
the UK it's in Europe and we do

114
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:50,780
extraction and we were the first to

115
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:52,788
industrialize the the eye slit in a

116
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,829
purified manner that was pharmaceutical

117
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:55,990
grade and bring it into the marketplace

118
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:59,598
there in the United States and now

119
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,370
globally I started a company from there

120
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,050
where we were taking the eye slit and

121
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:08,090
turned it into n consumer brands called

122
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:09,500
ISO dial and we just went public in 2017

123
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:11,629
it's now a four hundred million dollar

124
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,408
company that focuses solely on CBD and

125
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:17,449
CBD products and then in in in the midst

126
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:21,168
of that we also started a company called

127
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:23,060
CBD naturals and that company takes the

128
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:25,819
the cannabidiol and then uses

129
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,519
technologies like nano emulsification

130
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:31,129
and amplification to be able to put it

131
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:35,629
into water and reduce the amount needed

132
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:38,300
and increase the the effect so now I'm

133
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:39,769
focused 100% on that company in Europe

134
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,870
we're trying to find partners that we

135
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:43,279
can manufacture with here locally so

136
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,620
that our products and our product brands

137
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,819
can be produced here and then

138
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,899
distributed throughout the country yeah

139
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:56,329
hello my name is Emmanuelle Carson I'm

140
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:58,008
in this industry so I know for nearly 20

141
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:00,050
years we began with something total

142
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,509
different with media because nobody was

143
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,550
talking about the benefits of cannabis

144
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:11,750
itself so we founded a newspaper for for

145
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,908
consumers and for non consumers to print

146
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:18,168
out an information about the wonderful

147
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:20,269
benefits of cannabis itself and I'm a

148
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:22,939
happy guy because we did a lot of

149
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:25,009
projects last 20 years

150
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:28,759
and one of the projects we started two

151
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:31,789
years ago was it was not our like

152
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,159
intervention we we have a look on us and

153
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,370
have seen what's going on there and we

154
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,880
discovered this CBD market can be a

155
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:44,870
reality in Europe as well why not and we

156
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:48,129
we started to to figure out could just

157
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,240
be legal in Germany and we found out yes

158
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:54,879
so let's do it

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:58,189
it's it's really a pleasure to to really

160
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:01,250
work with a product we love to work with

161
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:05,750
a product we love organic farming we

162
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:08,449
offer to transfer the the product itself

163
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,250
the more we can of the plant to the

164
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:13,699
people who need it and who want to use

165
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,160
it and we our way of course to a total

166
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,829
legalization in Germany as well but

167
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,310
let's say one of the step stones is

168
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:25,729
definitely the CBD market and so we're

169
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,550
happy we began two years ago and I'm

170
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:33,590
happy also about today for example

171
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:37,340
because the CBD future is happening just

172
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:40,189
now on the ICP see here we meet here the

173
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:42,829
pen company has a new distributor in

174
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:47,110
Germany and I'm very happy about this

175
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:49,699
future to happen no thank you thank you

176
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,750
well well this is really exciting

177
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:55,189
because you know when Jared you started

178
00:07:52,750 --> 00:08:00,199
biosynthesis and did your first sale to

179
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:03,199
bang what was that 2011 so it's 2018 in

180
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,930
seven years of we've just seen a massive

181
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,079
explosion of this industry and it's gone

182
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,240
not just around the US but worldwide so

183
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:15,139
I want to get some of your observations

184
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,750
and find out from you like what's

185
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,129
changed since you started this industry

186
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,199
you know you start it's been seven years

187
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,600
a lot has happened so give me a sense of

188
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,759
how things have changed what are some of

189
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,260
the trends that you've seen and what are

190
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,839
some of the key market drivers that are

191
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,418
really you know influencing this massive

192
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,728
growth anyone want to speak to that you

193
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,250
can

194
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,570
kind of I'll jump in whenever you have

195
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,820
something you want to say one of the

196
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,329
biggest changes is the price per kilo

197
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,940
yeah I think it was like $60,000 u.s.

198
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:47,159
now it's under ten you know in a lot of

199
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,110
places but that's definitely a big

200
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,289
change so it's great too because it's

201
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,120
easy to ex access from you know the

202
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,319
patient side point of view they're you

203
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,379
know they're able to take higher doses

204
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,060
they're able to make it more affordable

205
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:03,419
and I think some of the trends are you

206
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,309
know really we like to look at CBD you

207
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,769
know almost kind of like sugar you know

208
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:09,629
if you look at coca-cola they branded

209
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:11,009
sugar but you can run into any store and

210
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,909
grab a sugar packet and run out you

211
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,539
don't think you're stealing something

212
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:16,679
it's not that exciting but you know it's

213
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:18,539
branded so well and coca-cola and you

214
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,059
look at how big that company is we think

215
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,759
that the real future is going to be in

216
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,159
the end consumer brands and those that

217
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,350
do a good job with their branding and

218
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,509
then they're there their way of taking

219
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,100
the product and making it work even

220
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,649
better than if it was just taken in an

221
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,540
oil format so adding value adds like

222
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:40,649
that in the term of a delivery process I

223
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:43,230
think one of the big observations that

224
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,929
I've made is that the CBD market has

225
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:49,379
been the entree for a lot of people into

226
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:50,818
the THC market so I'll use my own mother

227
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:54,299
is an example she had a hip replacement

228
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:57,299
she what she was clean and sober would

229
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:59,250
not touch marijuana for pain and the

230
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,109
opiates were not helping her and I said

231
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,350
mom just try this it'll help you and it

232
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,169
did anecdotally so I have that story

233
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,759
personally but what I'm saying is

234
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:11,698
there's a lot of fears still around

235
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,769
using cannabis there's a stigma around

236
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:15,509
it and that's the next wave of what's

237
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,919
happening we've reached the tipping

238
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,169
point in the United States absolutely

239
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,259
and it's the tipping points coming

240
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:24,870
around the world but CBD products are a

241
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:28,100
safe way safe from people who are afraid

242
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,448
of getting high it's a gateway into

243
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,699
people having a comfort level with this

244
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:36,269
miracle plant that is really benefiting

245
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:38,250
people from anxiety and depression and

246
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:40,828
pain and epilepsy

247
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,990
it's helps so many things so we're

248
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:44,849
really seeing CBD make a difference in

249
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,680
people's lives but also helping the

250
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,810
cannabis industry

251
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,059
so anyway I'm seeing that trend where

252
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,189
some of the the battling between the

253
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,929
cannabis people and the in the CBD

254
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,400
people is going away because they're

255
00:10:54,929 --> 00:11:01,949
seeing us as being a huge benefit I

256
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,549
really must add exactly at this point

257
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:08,550
the stigmata still it has not changed

258
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:12,599
and I have to add my own mother refused

259
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:16,349
a CBD product some months ago even she's

260
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,070
she's using morphine in the same minute

261
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,259
and even I'm working on this for many

262
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:27,839
many years I could not persuade her

263
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:28,588
that's so how to how to express it's no

264
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,360
success

265
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:36,620
it's it's really like losing something

266
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:39,060
on the other side I see in our CPT shop

267
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,899
where we see their customers we have new

268
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:45,209
customers all the one the females are

269
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:51,720
coming even day buying for for a husband

270
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:54,150
but ladies 7080 CR years old when we go

271
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,550
through for example we have been in

272
00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:00,350
Washoe people with young children in the

273
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:03,629
came by and asked how much CBD I

274
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,839
have to use for these empties disease

275
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:09,960
and the trauma is I cannot tell about it

276
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,230
because in Germany I'm if I'm not I'm a

277
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,100
pharmacologist or doctor I'm not allowed

278
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:20,789
to tell about any consequences of taking

279
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:25,409
a substance better not I think the other

280
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:26,639
trend I'm seeing is banking is changing

281
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:28,980
we talked about this when we were

282
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,970
getting ready for the panel credit card

283
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,350
processing is the biggest issue and

284
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,589
we're starting to see that loosen up

285
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,629
we're banking and credit card companies

286
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,459
are starting to understand that in the

287
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,129
EU for example you have to have less

288
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:46,169
than 2 percent THC for your product to

289
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:49,679
be legal if it's hemp derived in the

290
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:51,329
u.s. it's less than 3 percent THC what

291
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,979
the the banking companies are

292
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,190
understanding is okay this is not

293
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,810
marijuana so this isn't the federally

294
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,670
scheduled drug we might be able to let

295
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,979
these company

296
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:03,049
have credit card processing so I know

297
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,340
you have credit card processing and I'm

298
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,339
in the process of getting it it's more

299
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,870
expensive but it's full disclosure they

300
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,350
were not hiding anything

301
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,450
and that's another entree into the world

302
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,779
so to speak what one of the things that

303
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,360
might help in you know we just executed

304
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,120
an exclusive with a partner now called

305
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,789
immune AG and in India they went in the

306
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,370
jungle and found feral cannabis growing

307
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:31,099
with humulus plants you know hops plants

308
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,810
and I started to do test them on all

309
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,820
these hops plants and found some with

310
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:37,459
THC and then they found some with CBD

311
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,040
only and they then started to grow that

312
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:44,180
in a greenhouse and now years later we

313
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,159
we have pure you know oil form isolate

314
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,649
form when it comes with bata Karratha

315
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,559
lean and humulin and when we go to the

316
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:53,059
bank with the humilis based CBD or like

317
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,609
Facebook for instance who is closed down

318
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,469
any advertising capability for CBD

319
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,149
companies and hemp companies the doors

320
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,779
open back up when it's when it's hops

321
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,579
based so explain a little bit what about

322
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,679
the humilis CBD and what that is for

323
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,470
people who might not be familiar sure so

324
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,959
you know cannabidiol is cannabidiol you

325
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:15,500
know if you've gotten it from marijuana

326
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,389
or hemp and you know in in america

327
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,820
there's been an interesting bit of a war

328
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,799
between the marijuana companies and then

329
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,629
so-called hemp companies and people were

330
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,219
saying marijuana based CBD is better

331
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,519
than hemp base CBD and none of that

332
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,300
makes any sense I mean it's CBD is CBD

333
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,460
so if you can find it in another plant

334
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,379
it's also the same thing and in humilis

335
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,310
which is the I guess a technical name

336
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:41,929
for hops and you know the doctor that we

337
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:43,250
work with hates it when we call it hops

338
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,469
even though it is hops because there's

339
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,809
so many varieties of hops and the stuff

340
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,269
that they use for beer doesn't yield CBD

341
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:52,399
but this is humulus and it's not him and

342
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:54,919
we are able to extract now in a large

343
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,870
massive way the same thing that we've

344
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,979
been talking about you know with

345
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,019
cannabis

346
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,060
you know hemp the CBD that we're

347
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,879
extracting is the same and what we

348
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:06,739
really have found which i think is a new

349
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,120
thing for the future everybody may have

350
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,049
heard of the entourage effect have you

351
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,328
heard of full spectrum entourage effect

352
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,799
you know there's like 500 ingredients in

353
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:17,528
this and so there's so many things that

354
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,689
could be helping you even hurting what

355
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:22,838
we've found is that beta-carotene which

356
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,759
is a terpene it's also now called a

357
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,380
dietary cannabinoid because it's in our

358
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,560
diets I mean it's in black pepper it's

359
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:32,740
and eucalyptus well with the beta

360
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,778
carotene mixed with the CBD the cb2

361
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,720
receptor is able to do its job even

362
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:39,220
better because it's a modulator between

363
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,170
the immune system and the nervous system

364
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,389
and that's why we see it affects so many

365
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:46,240
things so positively itting increases

366
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:49,149
that communication well CBD is actually

367
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,860
a blocker to things that block the CBT

368
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,679
receptor so something that's blocking

369
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,810
its ability that CBD goes and defends

370
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,208
that and stop that blocker but beta

371
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:59,948
karratha lean accentuates it and when

372
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,599
you would combine them and I've been

373
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:03,429
working with CBD so long and I've seen

374
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,290
how how great it works but there's just

375
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,000
been a little bit of like I kind of

376
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:09,338
wished it was going to be a miracle okay

377
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,679
and it is now I mean when you combine it

378
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,420
with beta carotene we've we've seen the

379
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,698
best at if you have a hundred milligrams

380
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,679
of CBD 60 milligrams of beta Crossley

381
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:19,269
and so you know six to ten so to speak

382
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,778
there you know six milligrams at 10

383
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:25,360
milligrams is an incredible combination

384
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:26,948
and the entourage effect is unbelievable

385
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,800
it's something you should definitely try

386
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:31,240
well it's like when I'm listening to him

387
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,039
and I'm learning something new I'm

388
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,959
thinking okay the next sleep then is

389
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,129
educating the customer because you're

390
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,919
going to have to have your population

391
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:40,720
understand what he just said and why

392
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:42,938
they want to buy that particular product

393
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,040
and I think what's happening is there is

394
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:46,929
a lot of people going out now and

395
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,629
seeking that education so there's

396
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:51,729
another opportunity for people you know

397
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:54,519
like Emmie who are providing the

398
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,230
information through their media outlets

399
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,419
and things and that's what I feel like

400
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,879
when I heard her Henry speak on the

401
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:03,278
first day and the panels throughout the

402
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:06,369
day is that what's incumbent upon us in

403
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,869
this room is to start educating because

404
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,369
we have reached the tipping point and

405
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,649
it's time to come out of the closet and

406
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:15,219
say hey I'm a cannabis user I'm a

407
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:17,140
cannabis business person and in the next

408
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,289
tipping point is everybody coming out of

409
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,170
the closet and saying

410
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:22,849
you know this is an industry so I love

411
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,009
hearing I love coming to these things

412
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,109
and learning something new I'm in I'm in

413
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,150
the CBD world and I'm like wow he just

414
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:32,149
blew my mind it's awesome well who blew

415
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,610
my mind was actually Mary Patton in 2010

416
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,630
she says you know in Ireland I don't

417
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:37,909
know if this is actually true I never

418
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,920
looked it up but I'm hoping it is she

419
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,440
said in Ireland there was this outbreak

420
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,460
of something called scurvy and it was

421
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,170
not really a disease it was it was a it

422
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,079
was because of the vitamin C deficiency

423
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,240
and so really the she said you know if

424
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,069
you look at vitamin C it's a nutritional

425
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,529
necessity that we have to have otherwise

426
00:17:55,069 --> 00:18:00,200
bad things happen and she was I believe

427
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,569
that phyto cannabinoids are a

428
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,460
nutritional necessity that we haven't

429
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:06,649
had in our diet for a very long time

430
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,269
because of it being banned whereas when

431
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,040
you look before the 1930s it would grew

432
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:12,559
wild on seven continents you know

433
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,869
animals ate it you know it's just it was

434
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,179
in our bodies through ways of you know

435
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,250
other animals eating it and us eating it

436
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,980
and and now it hasn't been and you can

437
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,970
look at since then look at the neural

438
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,460
neurological diseases and the things

439
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:30,650
that have just I mean increased you know

440
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:32,600
Al's timers ADHD dementia to the point

441
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:36,259
then you know when we're talking about

442
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:39,469
how patients or you know a human if

443
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:41,539
you're not a patient access product you

444
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,579
know CBD is sold sometimes for in

445
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:46,309
pharmaceutical outlets sometimes in

446
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,740
lifestyle outlets where you where are

447
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:51,289
your customers accessing your products

448
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,420
most often and you know are you able to

449
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:56,299
get it into the pharmacies here in

450
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,620
Germany for example right now so I'd

451
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,259
like to hear a little bit more about

452
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,729
your target markets and and how they're

453
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,470
accessing your product I'm very happy

454
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,349
about this question because it's really

455
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,380
connected to what you just told you made

456
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,209
something wonderful for me you made some

457
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,110
recommendation how to use it

458
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:17,900
which I'm not allowed to do because

459
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:19,759
might be it could be against the

460
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,680
competition law it has nothing to do

461
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,019
with CBD but with a pharmaceutical

462
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,620
competition law just

463
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,089
so that's one of our problems even I

464
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:31,129
have some information

465
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:33,319
I cannot forward it really want to one

466
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,560
to my customer this is really a problem

467
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:39,939
and this is this is a goal for everybody

468
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:44,059
who is in this industry and patients

469
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:47,000
doctors dispensaries whoever to multi

470
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:49,929
multiply it in the information in this

471
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,849
moment when I'm on a on an affair and

472
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,740
and the client is asking me really the

473
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:57,500
the the core questions

474
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,109
I cannot tell him tell him honestly more

475
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,990
than have a look on the American pages

476
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:04,459
they can talk about it yeah it's it's a

477
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,700
little bit crazy

478
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,460
but what to say I'm not really allowed

479
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,759
to explain it you slug and she be google

480
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,150
it yes of course yeah but I know exactly

481
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:19,970
because you have now like a very big

482
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,980
market and you doing some research and

483
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,190
there is some evidence and you have some

484
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,470
recommendations and you are yeah this

485
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,960
the information which which we need here

486
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,839
but we are not allowed to talk really

487
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:37,549
open about it or not not when you want

488
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:39,439
to to make really the sales in the legal

489
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:42,200
way you asked me about the distribution

490
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,259
points I'm very very happy because this

491
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,370
changes a lot last year on the ICBC we

492
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:52,309
have been discussing about a c bt lea

493
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:55,549
little globally in germany and we can we

494
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:58,579
sell it or not we answer that question

495
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:01,579
yes yes we we already sold now it's

496
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:04,879
evident but there are many distribution

497
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:07,789
ways so we are mainly selling in this

498
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,630
moment to our core clients which are

499
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:14,180
mostly grow shops had shop smart shops

500
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,830
but that's not our goal our goal is of

501
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,850
course to be in the middle of the

502
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:23,389
society we are attending to to

503
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:25,609
ecological shops to to organ farm in

504
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:29,030
shops and what is of course like the

505
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:30,869
crown of the business in this point are

506
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:34,440
the pharmacies

507
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:38,149
it is not easy but it's it's possible to

508
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,160
to receive like a pharmaceutical number

509
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,559
and I'm also happy to announce today

510
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,040
from the first of May we have a official

511
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:48,869
product in cooperation with with our

512
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,839
partner from Poland which is making

513
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:54,359
really great CBD thank you to a yacht

514
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,939
sig if you are here and thanks to hem

515
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,189
Poland from Poland really good stuff and

516
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,130
we got registered this is for the

517
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:06,299
pharmacies with a real pharmaceutical

518
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:08,190
number and as a food supplement so you

519
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:15,808
can you can buy it without any

520
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:19,019
prescription biggest very similar to

521
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:22,139
what Emmy said we have dispensaries in

522
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,539
the US head shops vape shops see

523
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,880
cigarette shops are big on carrying CBD

524
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:29,879
we have a lot of lifestyle shops so we

525
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,790
have a lot of people from yoga retreats

526
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,470
and places that are wellness oriented

527
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:36,869
contact us and then of course we have

528
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,269
our bulk CBD buyers that I would say

529
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:41,339
make up a good 50% of our business so

530
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:44,009
that's what we're selling we've had a

531
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:47,279
challenge in the US as well for the

532
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:49,710
legal compliancy side of things you know

533
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,319
you have the DEA there which is you know

534
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,240
going to be really enforcing the drug

535
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,879
control and whether or not this is a

536
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,109
scheduled drug and then you have the FDA

537
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,600
which is the Food and Drug

538
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:03,029
Administration who is really governing

539
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,039
more the labeling and the claiming which

540
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:06,539
we could be kind of what you're talking

541
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,099
about in terms of making a claim or

542
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,859
talking about in a way that you can't

543
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,779
and so you know with the attorneys in

544
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:14,819
the the legal expenses and the amount of

545
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,440
money that's been put into that you know

546
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:17,909
there's been some interesting things

547
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,289
have happened along the way I think

548
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,720
maybe it'd be good to share really quick

549
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:24,740
and you know and we've found ways of

550
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,410
labeling instead of putting CBD or

551
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,929
cannabidiol on the label calling it out

552
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:35,429
as an ingredient you know it's it's a

553
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:37,530
chemical name hemp oil is really what it

554
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:39,240
is when you take it from hemp and you

555
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:42,629
haven't you know derived it

556
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,950
synthetically it reminds me of something

557
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,340
and you probably have something similar

558
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,870
here

559
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,879
because most things are always the same

560
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:50,369
just word differently but we have a prop

561
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,170
65 in California it's anything that's

562
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:53,969
known to cause cancer if there is

563
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,670
something added to a product and it is

564
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,370
on the prop 65 list you have to label a

565
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,950
prop 65 warning on the bottle that it's

566
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:03,659
in and an example was mercy because

567
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,220
Mercy ins on that list which is a

568
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,980
terpene it's actually a Terp penis in

569
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,720
cannabis and in humps and in mangoes so

570
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,950
if you put Mercy in a product and you

571
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,079
put myrrh seen in the ingredients list

572
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,630
you'd have to put that warning however

573
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,639
if you're to take mangoes and extract

574
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,620
mercy from it in fact you were to just

575
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,630
keep extracting and throwing away

576
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:24,109
everything except for just that mercy

577
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:27,390
until a point where was 99% mercy and

578
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:29,759
then put on the ingredients list mango

579
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,200
extract because it still is you can do

580
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,079
that and you wouldn't be having to put a

581
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,990
process t5 warning on there so think of

582
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,759
that when you think of hemp oil and

583
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,039
extracting CBD from hemp and then using

584
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,019
hemp oil in the ingredients list and

585
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,670
then find clever ways of putting CBD on

586
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:48,269
in there like you know cash before

587
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:51,360
delivery notice K but uh but CBD you

588
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:55,619
know there's a lot of CB different you

589
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:58,319
know a vitamin C vitamin b12 and d3

590
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:00,000
you know vitamin CBD there's things you

591
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,649
can do when you're talking about a

592
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,890
lifestyle brand because there's going to

593
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:07,320
be the pharmaceutical clinical trial you

594
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,390
know dosage testing route which you'll

595
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,679
have and it's very expensive but it's

596
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,090
worth going into and you can do those

597
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,700
trials you can do that now we can get

598
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:16,889
into an OTC light over-the-counter you

599
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,509
know a situation like you have and then

600
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,370
there's the lifestyle brands but those

601
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:22,799
brands are going to be scrutinized based

602
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:24,689
on these claims and labels I think you

603
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,250
should be smart when you label those

604
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,380
things so you don't take them off the

605
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,750
shelf at some point as a practical point

606
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,960
of what he's talking about we put all of

607
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,839
our products on ebay our hemp derived

608
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,970
CBD products and we did a little

609
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,579
experiment and we had them listed all

610
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,039
with CBD and then we had them all listed

611
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:46,589
with hemp oil all the CBDs got shut down

612
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,930
eBay took them off their site all of our

613
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:50,730
hemp oil products remained so that's an

614
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,820
example of being smart about your

615
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,009
labeling labeling is a big

616
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:58,038
because there's so much that you can't

617
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:59,960
say about your product and and then you

618
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:02,269
know there's obviously restrictions and

619
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,360
rules and it's really confusing for the

620
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:07,159
consumer but you know what you can say

621
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,658
phyto cannabinoids yes there's phyto

622
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:10,580
Kanab lots of things are considered a

623
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:11,840
Fido cannabinoid a lot of the consumers

624
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:14,000
don't know what those are though right

625
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:15,829
so there's this education process that

626
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,589
needs to happen you know especially if

627
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:20,750
you're a brand right so we have a few

628
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:23,209
minutes you know I want to open up to

629
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:31,148
her some questions does anyone have any

630
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:44,210
questions yes all right is there a mic

631
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:45,859
speak louder me check-check give it up

632
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,940
for our CBD panel that was really nice

633
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,939
you guys thanks so much

634
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:55,879
[Applause]

635
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:03,548
hi thanks and so if you looking at the

636
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:06,288
European market from your point of view

637
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:09,349
would you enter the market with all your

638
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:12,788
products are would you go for a certain

639
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:15,259
category first how would you approach it

640
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:18,769
who would you direct your question to

641
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:20,870
really a bang definitely and did you say

642
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:24,500
the UK market specifically no the

643
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:27,229
European and the whole thank you I think

644
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,579
all of our products would be and I'm not

645
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,319
just saying that because I'm I'm

646
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:33,349
representing the brand but I think

647
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,359
because they're hemp derived and we have

648
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:37,418
had success with them in the US because

649
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,219
the delivery methods are discreet

650
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:42,830
meaning that you can put a pack of hemp

651
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,319
gum in your in your purse and you don't

652
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:48,168
have to you know roll a joint you know

653
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:51,048
there's a lot of ways especially to if

654
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:52,730
you're having health issues to be able

655
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:55,429
to eat a chocolate bar if you can't

656
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,048
smoke is is a great way to get some of

657
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,419
your dosing so they all provide a

658
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:02,779
different delivery method and I think

659
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:05,390
they're all relevant in this market

660
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,980
we've had some distributors larger

661
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,770
distributors already there in the

662
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:14,269
marketplace in some in Switzerland here

663
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:16,309
in Germany in UK and they've been really

664
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:18,079
focusing number one not just the

665
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,579
category and I don't know exactly why

666
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,990
but I'm gonna guess because there's

667
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:23,539
already a marketplace for it but that's

668
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:26,349
the whole VAP sector so it seems to be

669
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:29,329
that there's a lot of head shops and in

670
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:31,069
vaping is very popular so having some

671
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:33,589
great delivery systems maybe even some

672
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:35,960
metered dose of aping solutions that you

673
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:38,209
know tell you a dosage amount on a some

674
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,529
app or those type of things where

675
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,690
they're right you know disposable ones

676
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,430
like that and the ones that aren't I

677
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,519
think would be something to have as a

678
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:50,539
low-hanging fruit and then we've gotten

679
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,730
a huge flux of interest in beverages you

680
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,769
know so there's like an emulsification

681
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:57,799
process with other ingredients combined

682
00:28:54,769 --> 00:29:01,009
with it you know it from water to energy

683
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:04,399
drinks to lemonade's and teas and

684
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:07,129
coffees has been a big interest and then

685
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,150
gummies and I would assume for all ages

686
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,420
but there's been a lot of interest in

687
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:13,970
gummies yeah you asked about Europe

688
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,529
that's one of the problems we have 27

689
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:19,309
countries just in the European Union

690
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:21,619
plus Switzerland and plus another lot of

691
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:24,139
markets around which I would also call

692
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:26,449
European and its mission impossible to

693
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,790
tell you the rules in each country just

694
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,309
at a breakfast time I had a discussion

695
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:33,799
with a Swiss guy we have very similar

696
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:38,059
system speaking nearly the same language

697
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:41,869
and still I watch I would ask a lawyer

698
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:45,470
before you know before doing it exactly

699
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:48,589
so I know exactly your question you have

700
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:51,440
really - from my side to focus might be

701
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:54,529
on some products which looking more

702
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,600
serious because one of the there is for

703
00:29:54,529 --> 00:30:01,369
example in Germany not a law forbidding

704
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:04,399
you to to sell isolates but some of the

705
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:06,319
isolates are looking please forgive me

706
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,360
but some of the isolates are looking

707
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:13,138
like like crystal meth

708
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:16,888
and in some some areas of Germany it

709
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:19,199
might cause a wizard of the police I got

710
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:23,038
taken in jail because there's crystal

711
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,230
meth you and I and so better take the

712
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:29,519
products which are looking might be more

713
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:33,149
serious more more the way my grandma

714
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:36,058
also would love it and then make your

715
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:37,888
experience with European bureaucracy

716
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:41,898
because in each country it's different

717
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:44,548
even in Germany we have 16 states so

718
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:48,599
it's it's another game in Berlin it's

719
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:50,069
another game in Bavaria don't don't try

720
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,158
to cover all Europe at once

721
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:55,558
it's it's not possible it's too many

722
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,679
languages too many translations too many

723
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:01,349
labels which which are different

724
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,389
concentrate might might be first on a on

725
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:07,498
the pick market or might be on the

726
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:10,258
logical markets I mean Netherland as a

727
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:13,470
whole Andhra is a wonderful country to

728
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:15,960
come in quite liberal and but also they

729
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,298
have their own laws about many many

730
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,100
things they have regulations and since

731
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:22,769
they begin to open the first coffee shop

732
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:26,788
so you have to take care about many

733
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:29,669
aspects guess a question you might in in

734
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:31,440
the US with the FDA you can make a

735
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,659
product and then you can put on the

736
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,100
shelves and hope that you've done it

737
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,139
right based upon the guidelines that are

738
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,988
presented and you just gotta you know

739
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:41,788
make sure that you've done a good job

740
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:44,340
but you can legally put it out and sell

741
00:31:41,788 --> 00:31:45,569
it and distribute it is it different in

742
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,298
the Europe and Europe do you have to get

743
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:50,759
registration prior to getting products

744
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:54,269
distributed iron shells the risk is on

745
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:57,839
your side and you have to take care

746
00:31:54,269 --> 00:32:00,329
about its the risk is on the side of the

747
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:03,538
person who is the first one to buy from

748
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:05,579
out of European Union this person

749
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:07,888
overtakes like the responsibility this

750
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:10,288
product is good he can put it into his

751
00:32:07,888 --> 00:32:12,028
shelf without registration but overtakes

752
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:14,278
the responsibility if something is wrong

753
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:17,579
so I recommend if you have any

754
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:21,249
possibility to to let like register your

755
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:24,098
product as water supply mint or whatever

756
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:26,108
do it because better you have a

757
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:28,450
classification for it we have a text

758
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:31,808
number you have all the accountancy done

759
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,970
and afterwards you don't have any any

760
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:36,819
unanswered question when when the

761
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:39,909
prosecutor might cross your way it's

762
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:45,158
very simple thank you okay we have time

763
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:48,278
for one more thank you so much for

764
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,629
introducing us into the world of CVD you

765
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:54,638
mentioned the qualities of CVD for the

766
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:56,709
holistic aspect of the plant so I am

767
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:59,258
really interested to get to know how do

768
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,899
you see the potential of the CBD

769
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:05,940
discussion starting maybe from the US on

770
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:09,209
a world level to break the stigmata of

771
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:12,639
marijuana cannabis and what you see

772
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:19,749
disconnect like which responsibility

773
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:22,058
comes within I think first it begs the

774
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:23,528
natural question when you're talking

775
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:25,048
about the difference between hemp

776
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:29,499
derived and cannabis or marijuana

777
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:32,138
derived CBD most people don't even

778
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:35,499
realize it's the same plant but a

779
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:37,508
different plant and it all of a sudden

780
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:40,118
the education process starts and people

781
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:42,548
go oh I buy hemp t-shirts and those are

782
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:46,720
allowed and I buy hemp seeds at Costco

783
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:48,788
or you know Aldi and that's allowed so

784
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,079
this is hemp and then they start making

785
00:33:48,788 --> 00:33:53,440
the connections and I think that's

786
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,239
really what what is happening is at that

787
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,729
basic core level with people who know

788
00:33:55,239 --> 00:34:00,569
nothing it gives them a comfort level to

789
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:04,149
start having a conversation about

790
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:07,118
marijuana so I think that's that's where

791
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:08,710
it starts in my opinion I think - it's

792
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:11,828
gonna start changing even more you know

793
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:14,048
you look at vitamin b12 and right now I

794
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:15,548
from what I'm learning is that you can

795
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:18,579
only really get that from red meat or

796
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:21,579
synthetically made is that right it's

797
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:24,099
very difficult but no even vegans are

798
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:26,889
having a deficiency in vitamin b12 so

799
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:29,230
for a long time I think CBD has been

800
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:33,128
associated with just cannabis and now

801
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,599
we're able to extract it from hops so it

802
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:36,460
shouldn't really be just

803
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,789
Cannabis thing knowing when you when you

804
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,460
consume CBD to say I consume cannabis I

805
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:44,109
guess that's true but it's also you're

806
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,269
consuming a phyto cannabinoid that's

807
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:48,338
available in other species of plants

808
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:50,108
that don't have that stigma so I'm not

809
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,998
sure if CBD should have that stigma when

810
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:53,798
it's non psychoactive there's no way to

811
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:57,009
really overdose on it there's no risk of

812
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:59,679
abuse it shouldn't come with the stigma

813
00:34:57,009 --> 00:35:02,108
that THC has given really I've always

814
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,058
felt that what it's doing is it's

815
00:35:02,108 --> 00:35:05,558
providing an entry point to start

816
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:08,259
educating the consumer on the

817
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:10,450
endocannabinoid system in general it's

818
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:13,559
an easy topic for people to start to

819
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:16,358
learn how the endocannabinoids and

820
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,519
endocannabinoid system works so once

821
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:21,038
they get comfortable with CBD from hemp

822
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:24,189
and and realize that this is helping

823
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,900
them regulate pain or inflammation or

824
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,358
their immune response in some kind of

825
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,900
way then it's a natural progression to

826
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:34,088
be less afraid to try THC for for people

827
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,798
who might have had an issue with it so I

828
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:38,858
think that's one of the ways you can

829
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:41,528
break down the stigma you know we we

830
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:43,150
found out that we have this system that

831
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:45,369
all living creatures have this system

832
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,920
and that these plants also provide

833
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:52,088
something that we need for you know that

834
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,519
system to operate optimally just one

835
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:56,619
last note you know THC a which is how

836
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:59,649
the plant produces it naturally when

837
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:01,778
it's fresh off the bud is non

838
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,489
psychoactive also all right it's not

839
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:06,690
until you heat it or decarboxylate it

840
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:10,630
that the THC a turns into THC and the a

841
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:12,190
leaves and becomes psychoactive so as a

842
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,358
fresh plant the whole thing could be

843
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:18,249
ingest saw reduced and be non

844
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:20,108
psychoactive well thank you all for

845
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:21,368
coming and the brothers thank you all

846
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:26,880
very very much let's hear it again

847
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:29,680
preferences that was a wonderful panel I

848
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,099
can't wait to start mixing CBD in my

849
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,098
beer

850
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:40,969
