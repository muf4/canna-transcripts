for everybody and now entering the legal

41
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,280

we'll see what uh whether I can wake you

47
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,238
up a little with what is going to happen

48
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,479
in Germany as one of those countries in

49
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,640
the European Union which is on the

50
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,799
Forefront of the legalization of

51
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,839
cannabis in general

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,840
and here's what I would like to do with

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,900
you maybe some of you know that joke uh

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,719
what is the difference between a speaker

55
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,019
from the UK and the US and the German

56
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,120
speaker

57
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:53,819
the diff the difference is that the

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,459
speaker from the US and the UK usually

59
00:02:53,818 --> 00:03:00,199
starts with a joke the Germans start

60
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,200
with an agenda and he is mine

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,019
what I would like to do is to give you

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,360
an overview about the legal status of

63
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,000
cannabis in Germany at this point in

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,099
time in particular with respect to where

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,800
do we stand with medical cannabis so we

66
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:22,439
have a six years history of using

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,959
medical cannabis in Germany already and

68
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,878
where do we stand also with respect to

69
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,739
the legalization of cannabis for

70
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,259
recreational purposes which is heavily

71
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,400
discussed right now there are already

72
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,799
the first steps taken for a legalization

73
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,700
and some setbacks which we have actually

74
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,219
experienced in the constructive talks

75
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:47,039
with the European Commission

76
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:51,060
so let's go and start into the overview

77
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,878
here as you can see the current legal

78
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,860
status is that medical cannabis is

79
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,878
actually

80
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:02,580
allowed since March 2017.

81
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:06,179
with the consequence that Physicians can

82
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,099
prescribe cannabis as a narcotic for the

83
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,959
treatment for of certain diseases for

84
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:16,680
patients and we have heard this morning

85
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,079
different indications in Germany it is

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,319
not limited there are no limits with

87
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,780
respect to what does the physician think

88
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,779
about using cannabis for the treatment

89
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,299
of a certain disease so there are no

90
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:34,019
limitations they are of course to a

91
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,120
certain extent recommendations for the

92
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,299
for the Physicians for which indications

93
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,100
they could actually use cannabis of

94
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,800
course and if you look into the

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,740
respective study of the bee form the

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,759
majority of of the prescriptions since

97
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,340
2017 on the field of pain chronic pain

98
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,500
and other pain

99
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:58,739
up to 70 percent of the prescriptions

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,379
and then we have a follow-on a number of

101
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,379
different indications

102
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:06,360
and this is kind of interesting that

103
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,839
there is no limitation to that

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,840
indication list

105
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,339
um what you should also know with regard

106
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,680
to medical cannabis is that we have a

107
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,019
Public Health Care system which is

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,319
compulsory although everybody actually

109
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:24,538
has to have a health insurance scheme

110
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,060
has to be and pay for of course together

111
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:29,879
with his employer to that air scheme

112
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,879
with the consequence that the health

113
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,719
insurance system is going to reimburse

114
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,759
patients and also cannabis patients the

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,120
Cannabis patients in comparison to other

116
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:45,500
patients and that is kind of a a break

117
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,060
in the system have to apply to their

118
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,120
respective health insurance for the

119
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,839
reimbursement of their uh of their

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,639
prescription of cannabis products by and

121
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,339
do that together a physician and if

122
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,740
they're going to be

123
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,659
reimbursed or if they're going to be

124
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,699
confirmed that they are applicable to

125
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,919
the scheme they are going to be

126
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,300
reimbursed for their India for their

127
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:15,000
respective treatment with cannabis

128
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,918
around 60 of all applications are

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,439
approved by the public health insurance

130
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,538
companies 40 are rejected for whatever

131
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,819
reasons but you can refile of course

132
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,759
together with your with your physician

133
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,039
however you should also know that we

134
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,199
have a great number of self-payers

135
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,879
meaning they go to the Physicians the

136
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,340
Physicians prescribing the respective

137
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,579
therapy with cannabis and they go to the

138
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,679
pharmacy and pay by themselves uh this

139
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,839
they do not appear in the reimbursement

140
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,120
system

141
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,399
um the other point is of course where do

142
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,918
we stand with recreational cannabis

143
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,620
currently The Possession the cultivation

144
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,478
sale transfer Etc of cannabis for

145
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,918
recreational purposes is forbidden it's

146
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,478
prohibited

147
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:02,519
uh the violations are very clearly

148
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,038
defined in the respective narcotics act

149
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:08,758
and in other acts with a possible with

150
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:11,579
the consequences that actually there is

151
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,139
no market for recreational Cannabis at

152
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,139
this point in time

153
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:19,199
however do you have any idea how much

154
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:22,759
and how the quantities in the illicit

155
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,759
Market in Germany are currently

156
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,478
sorry okay I'll give you give you a hint

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,240
the medical Market is around 20 to 25

158
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,839
metric transparentum in Germany

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,840
currently

160
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,800
so what is the illicit market for

161
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,059
cannabis for recreational purposes it is

162
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,780
it is around 600 to 700 metric tons a

163
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,759
year so it is it and increasing and that

164
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,758
has actually caused of course the

165
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,939
government to reconsider whether the

166
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,460
prohibition of cannabis uh is actually

167
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,500
the right the right thing to do or

168
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,680
whether they should do it differently

169
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:11,279
and if we look into the timeline here

170
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,139
uh you see that the new government right

171
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,579
if he knew because it was actually

172
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:21,360
elected in in 2021 decided actually that

173
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:24,300
uh in their Coalition agreement to

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,759
legalize the recreational Cannabis two

175
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,840
sentences in the Coalition agreement

176
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,660
great

177
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,778
whatever what happens then actually I

178
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,879
think is this is necessary to say that

179
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:39,179
there was a consultation process with

180
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:42,179
experts so how can we do it and

181
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:45,299
unfortunately they did not invite any

182
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:49,759
kind of legal help there and legal

183
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:52,199
Consultants uh because actually the uh

184
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,778
legal framework

185
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,420
for the

186
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:59,580
legalization of recreational Cannabis is

187
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:03,500
relatively narrow

188
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:09,839
you all know the U.N conventions from

189
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:13,019
1961 from 1971 and from 1988 all these

190
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,420
U.N conventions of which Germany is a

191
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,820
member which they have signed on on the

192
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:21,419
conventions prohibit any kind of

193
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:25,920
transfer any kind of import and any kind

194
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:28,379
of use of drugs in general

195
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:32,519
for recreational purposes including

196
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:36,659
cannabis and THC rated products

197
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,839
so the German government in October 2022

198
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,860
thought about how can we actually manage

199
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,620
this

200
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,379
and they came up with a white paper with

201
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,720
a program in which way they would like

202
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,278
to legalize recreational cannabis in

203
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,980
Germany

204
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:55,559
and it was very very detailed so what

205
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,839
they wanted to do is they wanted to have

206
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,059
the cultivation domestically done in

207
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,920
Germany

208
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:04,879
for the recreational Market

209
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,740
they wanted to establish a

210
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:11,419
government-controlled distribution via

211
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:15,860
licensed shops or pharmacies or whatever

212
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:19,679
in order to fulfill the following

213
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,080
needs number one they wanted to attack

214
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,659
the illicit Market which was and is

215
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,839
still increasing they wanted to protect

216
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:30,240
the youth from misusing cannabis

217
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,940
and of course they wanted to increase

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,560
the quality for the consumer because

219
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,580
what you can buy on the listed market

220
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:41,219
and we all know that is probably not a

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,560
quality standard which you really would

222
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,100
like to have as a consumer I have seen a

223
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,619
list of what has been actually inserted

224
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,899
as well into cannabis sold on the lizard

225
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,560
Market you don't want to know what all

226
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:58,980
is in there and frankly speaking these

227
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:01,259
arguments are valid arguments from my

228
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,920
point of view and have been used in

229
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:07,919
order to create these new legalization

230
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:11,219
of calabis in Germany

231
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,979
besides other effects

232
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,139
with regard to the enforcement and

233
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,079
enforcement costs Etc

234
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:21,720
however this wonderful white paper and

235
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,359
the arguments of the government were

236
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,000
presented to the European Commission

237
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,000
why

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,820
Germany wanted to go actually in

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,578
contrast to the U.N conventions and in

240
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,560
contrast to the Schengen agreement and

241
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,120
the respective protocols because the

242
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,939
Schengen agreement which is the basis

243
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,278
for the European Union and their

244
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,680
protocols

245
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,559
also include a hundred percent

246
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,759
prohibition of recreational use of of

247
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,679
cannabis

248
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,860
of course of the Rocks but also of

249
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,799
cannabis and the European commission is

250
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,600
also a member or a party to the U.N

251
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,179
conventions themselves

252
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,820
so what the German government actually

253
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:09,479
wanted to do back in October November

254
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:12,240
2022 is to get at least kind of a

255
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,019
confirmation and nodding that Germany

256
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,320
can go actually this route by a

257
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,659
government-controlled cultivation

258
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,920
distribution and of course consumption

259
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:29,219
as far as possible undug in Germany

260
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:32,819
so the constructive talks with the

261
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,639
European commission led to a clear

262
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:39,060
no you can't do that

263
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,799
why is that so well the the European

264
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,138
commission very clearly followed the

265
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,539
Schengen agreement and what has been

266
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:49,019
agreed uh in the respective protocols

267
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:50,879
and said Germany if you go this route uh

268
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,120
and that's of course also an indication

269
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,458
for other EU member states uh we will

270
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,679
definitely initiate a respective

271
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,179
proceedings before the European court of

272
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,439
justice for breach of the Schengen

273
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,319
agreement

274
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,500
and in Germany had some bad experience

275
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,040
in the past with the European court of

276
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,899
justice first of all you may recall this

277
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,078
decision against Germany for

278
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:19,139
implementing a toll for private cars on

279
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,879
their highways which was clearly whoops

280
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,799
rejected by the European court of

281
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,919
justice despite the fact that we had

282
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,019
invested Millions already in that system

283
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:32,159
and the other one was for the collection

284
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:34,200
of data and storing data personal data

285
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,958
over a longer period of time that was

286
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,700
just recently and the German government

287
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,379
didn't want to have another proceeding

288
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,360
before the European court of justice so

289
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,360
I thought about Plan B

290
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:53,039
Plan B came out in 20 in April this year

291
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:55,680
and everybody was surprised

292
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,980
because if you look into the industry

293
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:02,099
and what we expected all was a kind of a

294
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,740
plan B which was following more or less

295
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,778
or is it in the borders with of the

296
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,539
Europe of the UN conventions and be

297
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:11,639
respective Schengen agreement and but

298
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,860
now the German government came up with

299
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:18,240
this wonderful idea we will elaborate in

300
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:21,600
a minute that we have a two pillar a two

301
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,120
pillar program for the legalization of

302
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,459
Columbus for recreational purposes

303
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:31,799
and in April 2023 Carlota

304
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:36,059
bachimir the two ministers presented

305
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:39,479
this second key Point paper with this

306
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:42,299
new plan and I will Enlighten you on

307
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,379
that in a minute how are we going to

308
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:49,139
legalize cannabis in Germany in July so

309
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,958
not too far back actually the German

310
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:56,159
government then presented for the first

311
00:14:51,958 --> 00:15:00,899
time a draft law on that so how does

312
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:04,078
this two pillar Pro program look like

313
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,059
the first pillar is the legalization of

314
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,359
the individual cultivation

315
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,399
so every adult in every household can

316
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,800
actually

317
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,220
cultivate three female plants at home

318
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:19,740
and can you use the flowers for their

319
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,579
own consumption

320
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,659
um

321
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:26,159
secondly there is this concept of

322
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:28,799
of joint I would say joint

323
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,578
self-cultivation with I would call it

324
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,838
cannabis clubs it's better to say

325
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:36,559
cannabis cultivation associations

326
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,079
because that is what it is

327
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:43,879
and I come back in more detail in what

328
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:46,799
these cannabis clubs were for these

329
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:49,139
different definition today what can

330
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,240
these cannabis clubs do how are they

331
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,379
created uh how many members can they

332
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,019
have how can they actually cultivate

333
00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:00,179
and I will Enlighten you on that in a

334
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,578
minute the second pillar which was

335
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,859
actually not only my favorite solution

336
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:09,179
but the solution which the industry

337
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,459
would have preferred uh is a regionally

338
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,019
limited scientifically monitored model

339
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,539
project

340
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,519
well that is within the boundaries of

341
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:20,939
the UN convention because if you look

342
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,679
into the U.N convention uh cannabis can

343
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,199
be used of course under government

344
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,458
control for medical and scientific

345
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,500
purposes

346
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,659
so that is exactly what Switzerland is

347
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,000
doing right now they have respective

348
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:37,039
projects already established in two

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,320
major cities where a registered

350
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,299
consumers can use and can get cannabis

351
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,879
for recreational purposes this is under

352
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,838
scientific control in order to collect

353
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,360
data

354
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,940
because that is necessary in order to

355
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,778
convince even in the long run let's say

356
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,399
in four years from now even the U.N the

357
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,899
U.N Convent sorry the European

358
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,940
commission and the European member

359
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,600
states that the respective legalization

360
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,220
may have a not negative but maybe even a

361
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,000
positive impact for example by

362
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,058
decreasing the illicit Market

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,919
the duration for that is five years

364
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:19,740
so the first pillar is now already

365
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,079
drafted the respective law is drafted

366
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:28,078
and actually was published not too long

367
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,078
ago on October on August 16.

368
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,100
um this law actually and I don't want to

369
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,918
bother you with too many of these

370
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,918
articles here but this law actually uh

371
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,919
stipulates in which way cannabis can be

372
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,740
consumed

373
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,840
and there are some details in that law

374
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,599
which I will show you in a minute

375
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,779
which are to a certain extent at least

376
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,038
questionable

377
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:58,200
in order to go through that a little bit

378
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,819
more in detail let me just jump to the

379
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,000
next slide

380
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:06,418
so here we are again with the three

381
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,339
plants and of course the obligation to

382
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,160
prevent access

383
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:14,579
uh by miners well that is I think

384
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,679
self-understood how you do that and how

385
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,019
you control that is of course not laid

386
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,900
out in this wonderful draft law

387
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:25,679
um because you know if we have let's say

388
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,960
uh 80 million people uh and we have

389
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
consumers I would say around well I

390
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,960
would at least say form four to four to

391
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,839
six million uh for for cannabis if they

392
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,819
start growing at home do you sense

393
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,220
police to their home and ask how many

394
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,678
plants they have there and how many

395
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,120
people are living in the household I

396
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,059
don't know whether this is workable or

397
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,178
not I have my doubts on that I believe

398
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:53,639
it's not really controllable however if

399
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,380
you look into the cannabis clubs in

400
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,460
digital here on the on the right side

401
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:03,600
they can have up to 500 members

402
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,940
it's an non-profit organization it's

403
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,298
very clearly stated in the law this is

404
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,940
for non-profit which means that each

405
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:14,879
member has to pay a natural three

406
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,279
probably and a membership fee and it's

407
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,440
going to finance actually then the

408
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,440
cultivation of the Cannabis by that

409
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,019
cannabis club because this cannabis

410
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,558
cultivation Association is allowed to

411
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:32,400
cultivate cannabis for its members

412
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:35,700
up to 500 per Club one person can only

413
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,700
be a member of One Club not of two clubs

414
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,860
so now you start looking into where can

415
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,880
we position those clubs for example in

416
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:47,099
in Berlin the capital city so they are a

417
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,140
very clear measurements that you have to

418
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,558
stay away from schools you have to stay

419
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:55,080
away from sport Arenas and so on

420
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:58,200
and old age homes which is

421
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:00,899
understandable let's but there is not

422
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,640
much space left in Berlin to find a

423
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,820
cultivation despite the fact that it's

424
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,559
really expensive to find a lot in in the

425
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,558
city itself in order to do the

426
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,418
cultivation

427
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:15,899
furthermore the the quality standards

428
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:17,759
are not yet defined is it gacp or even

429
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,120
GMP which I don't believe will be the

430
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:24,900
case but the quality standards are are

431
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,119
not yet defined for the cultivation and

432
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,240
this is also left open for the time

433
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,159
being and is left to the states to

434
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,579
really do the respective qualification

435
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,880
and of course granting the respective

436
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:40,319
licenses for that for these clubs

437
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,440
um

438
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,939
can you imagine the first members

439
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,798
assembly of let's say 500 members

440
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,298
discussing what kind of cultivars they

441
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,639
Club should

442
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:55,679
cultivate

443
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,700
it can be a very interesting discussion

444
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,580
to be very Frank so and here comes here

445
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,640
comes the next thing the consumers the

446
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:08,819
the who are allowed to actually grow

447
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,660
three plants at Home have to get their

448
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:14,700
seeds from those cannabis associations

449
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,980
even if they are not a member they

450
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,860
should find a member and ask for a

451
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:23,220
limited number of seeds to be used for

452
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:25,979
their at-home cultivation

453
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,740
and another interesting point is that

454
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:33,079
those P those members of a cannabis club

455
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:36,000
who are in the age of 18 to 21 can get

456
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:39,178
30 grams per month

457
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,659
but only with the THC content of up to

458
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,659
10 percent

459
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:47,820
uh how do you control that

460
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:50,099
well it can be controlled of course by

461
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:53,220
self-control you know the cannabis clubs

462
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:55,079
is actually having a register where the

463
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,519
members are coming in the date of birth

464
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:03,599
and then they're going to register and

465
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:08,058
really look who has received which

466
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:11,219
cannabis flour with Rich content

467
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:13,798
Frankly Speaking again here control is

468
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,259
an issue do we have a new then

469
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:18,058
Administration looking into not only

470
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:21,839
granting the licenses to the respective

471
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:23,460
cannabis clubs plus looking into whether

472
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,459
they are cultivating under the

473
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,140
respective quality

474
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,319
measurements and then of course only

475
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,500
handing over these cannabis to their

476
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:37,259
members in a limited quantity it's 50

477
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:41,819
gram for the other adults per month

478
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:45,440
25 grams per visit now Frankly Speaking

479
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,439
this is difficult to control

480
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,120
these are the I would say

481
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:54,959
parts of that law which are I would say

482
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,239
discussable at least what is I think a

483
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,298
good step forward is which you can see

484
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,179
here in the lower part is a

485
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:05,220
decriminalization

486
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:07,080
cannabis and THC will be taken out of

487
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,360
the German narcotics Act

488
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,519
it will actually be implemented in the

489
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:15,979
new cannabis act with the consequence

490
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:19,859
that the punishments for respective

491
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:22,380
offenses are first ever used because

492
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:26,699
everybody can now carry 25 grams of

493
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:29,520
cannabis without being punished but also

494
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,200
the respective trade which is forbidden

495
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,500
of course will be implemented in this

496
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,279
new cannabis Act

497
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:42,058
um and if you look into the draft law in

498
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:44,339
Article 2 to 7 actually the removal of

499
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:46,918
cannabis uh

500
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,480
is actually from my point of view and we

501
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,980
see as although in the medical Mark now

502
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,740
we look into the impact right now in a

503
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,659
minute uh positively and I think it's a

504
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,019
good step forward

505
00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:01,860
so if we go into uh the impact of this

506
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:04,619
cannabis act on the medical industry

507
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:06,538
I think it has its positive effects for

508
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:10,500
the medicinal cannabis industry you may

509
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:14,940
say well all those patients May then go

510
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,440
rather to uh the cannabis club or start

511
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,538
home growing

512
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,100
well the point is you know if you're

513
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:22,440
going to be reimbursed anyway as a

514
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,899
patient why should you do that that's

515
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,019
number one number two you know exactly

516
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,538
what you get if you go to the medical

517
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,058
Market you know exactly what is the

518
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:35,759
content what is the product who has

519
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:38,759
produced it and you have a much better

520
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,579
quality control and the whether the

521
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,879
self-payers even today would go to the

522
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:47,519
respective uh

523
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,740
cannabis clubs or to start home growing

524
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,200
I would say is questionable the

525
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,940
prescription would be valid for a longer

526
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,120
period of time because it's not any more

527
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,038
narcotic the psychological barrier of

528
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,678
Physicians prescribing a narcotic is

529
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,679
going to be removed it is now an RX

530
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,340
product which has also the positive

531
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,440
effect that it is can be probably used

532
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:13,639
as an e-prescription which is important

533
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:18,179
for the uh for the respective it market

534
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,880
and these respective uh prescriptions

535
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:24,000
can be

536
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:28,820
issued by other EU member states and are

537
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,819
and and aea can countries in Switzerland

538
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,940
evaluation of the of the law here

539
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,839
actually

540
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:42,179
as I said it is to a certain extent

541
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:44,879
difficult to control this first part and

542
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:48,059
everybody expected that the second part

543
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,460
would be implemented uh which is the

544
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:52,019
scientific control pilot project which

545
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,298
the German government decides

546
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:56,099
differently it is a draft law it has

547
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:58,079
been gunned through the cabinet which

548
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:01,619
means Chancellor and the ministers

549
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:04,819
approved it it goes no to the parliament

550
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:08,219
and if we look into the respective

551
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:10,139
Provisions which are important and I

552
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,778
mentioned that before these are the U.N

553
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,880
conventions and whether we will get a

554
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,200
visit from the incb which is the

555
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,900
international narcotic control board

556
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,538
which is the police of the UN

557
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,559
conventions uh is questionable because

558
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:28,319
you know home grow and cannabis clubs

559
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:31,500
may not really be actually in line with

560
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,720
the UN conventions but what is going to

561
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,339
happen Canada after the legalization of

562
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,058
cannabis has received some warning

563
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:43,740
letters from the incb so far

564
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:45,839
the EU law may also be at least a little

565
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:49,019
hurdle here well they have talked to the

566
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,359
EU European commission and they have to

567
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:54,658
a certain extent that you can't do that

568
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:57,000
maybe they nodded and say let's do this

569
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:58,919
but we don't know that and we'll see how

570
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,960
this will work out

571
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,140
so what is going to happen here is the

572
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,900
implementation the Cannabis gazettes as

573
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:10,740
we call it has already been approved by

574
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,179
the federal cabinet as I said uh it is

575
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,460
now going to the parliament there's a

576
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:17,100
question whether this law has to be

577
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,500
approved by the second chamber which is

578
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:21,178
the bundusrat in Germany the government

579
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,058
is not of the opinion they think think

580
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,038
that with the respective majority of the

581
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:28,440
parliament of the green party the

582
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:31,859
Liberals and the social Democrats they

583
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,259
can actually put that new law which the

584
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:36,178
first is the first pillar in place the

585
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,278
second pillar and the respective draft

586
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,159
law will probably come out in October

587
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:43,200
and we'll see whether the discussion how

588
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,140
the discussion will go on here this

589
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,120
first law the first pillar has received

590
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,360
significant criticism and you have heard

591
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:54,058
already for me that there are arguments

592
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,178
which you can actually use against that

593
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:59,700
so if you look into that time frame uh I

594
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:02,038
do not expect implementation of that

595
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,759
legalization of cannabis in the first

596
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:08,400
pillar before I would say mid-2024 if we

597
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,038
are lucky from my point of view

598
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,778
all right so I hope I haven't brought

599
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,599
you to death with that wonderful

600
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:18,240
development here uh but it's a I think

601
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,278
important to see because we are uh the

602
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,839
country in in Europe who has actually

603
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,480
made some significant efforts in order

604
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,099
to legalize it uh which is good there's

605
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,058
no doubt about that whether the

606
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,599
measurements which they have they're

607
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:32,339
taken right now is I would say uh the

608
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,278
best way to do it and the blueprint I

609
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:37,038
have my doubts thank you very much

610
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,440
Peter Holmberg

611
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,000
thank you I think we are out of time for

612
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,159
Q a

613
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,720
but uh we have to get on to the next

614
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,159
panel but thank you so much and I'm sure

615
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,480
you can talk to them in the hallway or

616
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,640
at the party tonight you'll be at the

617
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,259
parking right Peter one of the best

618
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,600
known part of yours in all of Germany

619
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:56,599
you can't tell to look at him
