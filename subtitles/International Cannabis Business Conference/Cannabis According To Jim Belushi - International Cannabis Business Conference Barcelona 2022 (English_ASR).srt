25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,040
part in

26
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,039
yeah but i liked the dog it was

27
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,280
exactly um

28
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,239
but uh you also so easy to make fun of

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,118
i'm so sorry please forgive me

30
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,438
but actually i first knew as a member of

31
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,239
the blues weather band

32
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,239
yes

33
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,439
i'm a member of the blues brothers

34
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,759
and which is uh from your brother it's

35
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,598
kind of your brother was a was a kind of

36
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,959
my brother was the original blues

37
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,878
brother with dan aykroyd they did in

38
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,159
1979 1980.

39
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,598
they started on saturday night live

40
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,280
and

41
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,399
it's just one of the most beautiful

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
movies it was actually

43
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,238
probably the first

44
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,400
music videos

45
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,640
because all those little

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,039
vignettes in the movie where they were

47
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,958
doing songs were essentially music

48
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,719
videos

49
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
and uh also it was probably one of the

50
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,120
most diverse films

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
uh made at that time

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,640
so yes the blues brothers it's a great

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
film

54
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,759
but at that time as you told me before

55
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,318
you were not involved in the in the

56
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,479
show business at all and that started no

57
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,238
i was i was involved in show business

58
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,560
yes absolutely

59
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,878
in 1976 i was at the theater

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,319
called the second city in chicago and

61
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,318
before that i was in college

62
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,958
and is there another interview going on

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,959
over here

64
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,680
oh i just heard somebody talking i just

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
want to make sure i heard their answer

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,480
[Music]

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,439
it must have been interesting

68
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,000
anyway

69
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,400
so in 1976 i was in the second city

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,959
improvisational theater

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,959
and then

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,239
see 1980 i did a movie

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,239
called thief with james kahn

74
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,598
michael mann directed was his first film

75
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,919
and at the same time i think john and

76
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,919
danny were doing the blues brothers

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
and

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
how come that you are a member of the

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
blues brothers band then is that any

80
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
anything to do with danny did he involve

81
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,759
you later on well yeah you know it's

82
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,799
funny because i i you know i had kind of

83
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,878
a separate career from john

84
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,799
you know uh separate but together

85
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,199
because john was originally in second

86
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,239
city and i went there when i was 16 and

87
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,519
i saw john and i thought

88
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,078
wow

89
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,160
this place is magic

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,400
and so

91
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
the next four years

92
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,399
i was like

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,439
i've got to be in second city so i went

94
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,758
to second city and learned to improvise

95
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,519
and john was doing saturday night live

96
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,879
and he was

97
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,198
famous for

98
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,279
you know cheeseburger cheeseburger the

99
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,759
samurai

100
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,478
the blues brothers

101
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,479
and so i was a fan you know like you

102
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,159
were you know i mean they were so great

103
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,439
on saturday night live and the blues

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,800
brothers was such an amazing film

105
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:00,360
and then john passed

106
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,360
and then in 1992

107
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,280
maybe three

108
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,439
dan aykroyd wanted me to join the blues

109
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,879
brothers with him

110
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,120
and i said danny i can't i can't do that

111
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,399
you know that was you and john i i got a

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
separate

113
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,038
kind of thing going on

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,000
and he said oh absolutely not jimmy it's

115
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:25,360
like a law firm you know when uh when

and i went no danny danny no that was

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560

honestly the blues brothers is one of

208
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,040
the great great

209
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,040
uh well you know what it's uh

210
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,399
it was magic

211
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,000
what john and danny did

212
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,839
and the mission is so great because it's

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
it's

214
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,680
music

215
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,278
and you know

216
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,639
music

217
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,200
is

218
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,799
spiritual it's the closest to god that

219
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399
you can get

220
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:33,919
is music

221
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
the sound of means whether it's

222
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,759
beethoven

223
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,080
or a baptist revival in georgia

224
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,080
the singing that brings you closer to a

225
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,839
spirituality

226
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,560
and that's what's so great about

227
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,800
watching that movies you can feel

228
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,039
you can feel it and the movie also

229
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,439
you know it had fun

230
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,480
it was fun it was funny

231
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,760
and the most important part to me

232
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,759
was

233
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,720
that little phrase that danny came up

234
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,559
with

235
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,040
and that is a mission from god

236
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,359
so those three elements to me

237
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:14,879
i thought made a

238
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,680
is what cannabis is about

239
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,679
there's there's a spirituality to it

240
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,799
there is fun to it

241
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,120
and

242
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,919
deeply for me is a mission from god and

243
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,560
the medicine involved with cannabis

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,838
the healing the pathway to healing and

245
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,119
cannabis

246
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,480
so as a brand i thought you know what

247
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,320
blues brothers is a brand

248
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,399
it's not just a name

249
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,160
it's a brand it has meaning to people

250
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,879
people connect

251
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,480
to

252
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,639
some kind of personal connection with

253
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,759
the blues brothers

254
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,399
and i think

255
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,240
cannabis is on a mission from god also

256
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,639
in the pathway to healing so i thought

257
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,680
it was a perfect blend

258
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,879
to bring cannabis and the blues brothers

259
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,919
together

260
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,078
so you are very very passionate about uh

261
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,278
music you're also very passionate about

262
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,719
your uh

263
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,480
job as an or your profession as an actor

264
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,519
and um

265
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,519
when it comes to cannabis uh what

266
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,000
you're born as a musician

267
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,879
and as an actor but cannabis did it it

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,639
came later what did uh what did make you

269
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,879
become a cannabis entrepreneur well you

270
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,639
gotta understand something that that as

271
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,120
a

272
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,879
i gotta stand up these chairs are really

273
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,759
confining

274
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,000
uh you gotta understand something with

275
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,559
with acting

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,839
the purpose

277
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,159
my purpose has always been

278
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,560
to entertain

279
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,360
and when you entertain

280
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,958
you are when you make people laugh

281
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,839
they re release endorphins

282
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,439
which makes them feel

283
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,959
good when you come to a concert with

284
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,320
your partner or your girl or your wife

285
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,078
you know you might have had a little

286
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,639
fight in the car

287
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,958
but after you experience

288
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,879
a performance you might be laughing and

289
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,119
feel good and you go home together with

290
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,720
your head up

291
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,320
and so the mission is what

292
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,079
to make people feel good

293
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,560
cannabis

294
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,799
is the same

295
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,039
cannabis

296
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,679
the wellness encampment cannabis

297
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,679
includes

298
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,719
helps with alzheimer's headaches

299
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,399
ptsd

300
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,480
back aches pain but it also enhances

301
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,559
the taste of food

302
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,159
it enhances the touch of your lover's

303
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,399
skin

304
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,719
it also

305
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,399
makes you feel good

306
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,440
and you should never feel bad about

307
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,799
feeling good it makes you light

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,680
brings you closer to the light

309
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,519
which is enlightenment

310
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,559
so

311
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,159
i think i'm right on purpose

312
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,479
as an actor

313
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,360
performer to try to make people feel

314
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,879
good

315
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,639
i've naturally moved into cannabis

316
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,639
which is another

317
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,519
type of vehicle to make people feel good

318
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,799
so

319
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,440
it's a natural extension for me

320
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,120
so when it comes to belushi's farm which

321
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,639
is your

322
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,759
place where you grow your cannabis

323
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,079
how can we imagine that place

324
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,078
is it

325
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,839
you make me nervous

326
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,838
am i making you nervous

327
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,788
[Music]

328
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,240
wow

329
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,838
they're different than the united states

330
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,838
mine are flat

331
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,278
yeah yeah you're the flatman yeah mine

332
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,360
are yours are kind of like four-sided

333
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,958
how much for your shoelaces

334
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
how much

335
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,078
how much how much

336
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,680
you can have them i can have them

337
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,399
immediately yeah i think it would look

338
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,679
good one brown or one gray i think we'd

339
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,320
look cool together walking down the

340
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,519
street with different shoelaces

341
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,760
so anyway

342
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,839
belushi's farm

343
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,838
is a farm in southern oregon

344
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,919
about a mile i mean about an hour from

345
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
the california border

346
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,120
and

347
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,958
it is the most beautiful spot to grow

348
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,440
cannabis

349
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,439
because

350
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
i live right next to a river and i pull

351
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,240
the water from that river and it's

352
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,078
almost a perfect ph like between a six

353
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
two and a six seven

354
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,919
it's like feeding fiji water to the

355
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,759
plants

356
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,439
it's loma soil we have about 292 days of

357
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,360
sunshine

358
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
which is perfect

359
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,919
now i'm in what they call the banana

360
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,639
belt that's shaped like a banana leaf of

361
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,399
a perfect growing situation

362
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,639
for grapes

363
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,919
peaches

364
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,519
pears

365
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,039
and cannabis

366
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,639
yeah yeah so the the

367
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,958
latitude longitude

368
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,639
i mean i think god's

369
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,239
when god was done creating the earth

370
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,399
and on the seventh day when he was

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,959
walking home

372
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,958
he dragged his hand as he was walking

373
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,518
because he was so tired

374
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,919
and his fingers just kind of crossed the

375
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,120
soil across the globe

376
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,599
in this beautiful growing area

377
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,679
across the world we are in the same

378
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,639
parallel

379
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,958
as bordeaux and burgundy

380
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,159
and across the united states the corn

381
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,359
belt

382
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:08,159
so that from napa valley up to about 20

383
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,399
miles past my farm

384
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,159
is just

385
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,120
it's like

386
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:19,439
havana is for tobacco

387
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,759
so the cannabis that we grow in oregon

388
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,920
and northern california

389
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,720
and i'm going to say it

390
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,360
it's the best cannabis in the world

391
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,399
it is rich with terpenes

392
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,000
rich with terpene values

393
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,679
thc values can get very high which i'm

394
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,600
not really

395
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,719
big on

396
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,600
high thc values

397
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,759
i really believe that the combination of

398
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,000
maybe a 19

399
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,360
thc and a 3

400
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
to 5

401
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,399
value in terpenes

402
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,600
creates an entourage effect

403
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,399
that

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,240
doesn't leave you with the back end of

405
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,798
feeling a little anxious

406
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
or paranoid it's just

407
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,038
perfect

408
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,319
there's a stream that i have

409
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,318
it's called cherry pie

410
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,838
that's a 19

411
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,439
thc

412
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:24,240
and the last test was like 275

413
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,360
of terpene values

414
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,359
that combination

415
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,798
you know i'll tell you a story

416
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,279

417
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,558

423
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,679

oh jim

428
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:02,319
i hit some sushi with my mom last night

429
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,960
anything else

430
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,720
and he said why are you wasting my time

431
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,079
asking me what i want to eat when you

432
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,079
know we're going to go where you want to

433
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,480
go and we're going to eat what you want

434
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,480
to eat

435
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,919
and boy she gave me a look like ah

436
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,918
maybe you're hungry right

437
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,440
the next night i came i took a hit of

438
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,559
this cherry pie

439
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,320
and i came down the stairs

440
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,879
and she said

441
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:35,599
are you hungry i went yeah

442
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,200
do you want to go to eat sure

443
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,439
where do you want to go

444
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,519
i said baby we can go to taco bell as

445
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,919
long as you're sitting across from me

446
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,160
and she looked at me like

447
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,919
aren't you being charming

448
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,720
and i'm thinking am i but i'm really

449
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:57,120
thinking cherry pie

450
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,679
the cherry pie is the marriage counselor

451
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,918
so this cherry pie i have an organ just

452
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,759
sold out in like two months

453
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,000
and i can't keep it stocked because

454
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,400
people come into the stores going

455
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,880
where's that marriage counselor he needs

456
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,919
it

457
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,240
so

458
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,640
the combination of the thc in the

459
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,000
terpenes is really

460
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,759
i don't even know if they test for

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,759
terpene values here

462
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,839
not yet yeah

463
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:27,200
that's really one of the things to look

464
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:29,678
for opposed to the high thc levels

465
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,400
so anyway police chief's farm yeah so

466
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,280
it's 93 acres is on the river i have

467
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,080
four greenhouses now

468
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,759
and i documented it in a uh

469
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,079
a

470
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,400
reality show called

471
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,319
growing belushi

472
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,280
is that broadcast that you ask quite

473
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,200
that

474
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:56,160
well it's on discovery plus

475
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,038
and i believe discovery plus is

476
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,000
an international platform

477
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,839
so but you have to buy discovery

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,839
plus whatever that is

479
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,839
but we also are releasing it the

480
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,839
different distributor

481
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,319
i think ant

482
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,759
is disturbing in different countries

483
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,519
but it really documents

484
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,279
the farm

485
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,079
uh i think i really believe it's the

486
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,960
first cannabis show that

487
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,359
shows us for who we are

488
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,519
it's not like a stoner show nobody's

489
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,000
getting stoned on this show

490
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,839
nobody's getting too you know high and

491
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,759
goofy and stupid

492
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,558
it's really about cultivating cannabis

493
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,480
but

494
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,839
my mission

495
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,360
on the show is creating

496
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,359
confidence in cannabis

497
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,559
so in order to create confidence in

498
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,759
cannabis

499
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,558
for the new consumer or

500
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,798
they need to know

501
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,279
how it's done

502
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,519
we show them that how cleanly the

503
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,558
cleanliness in which we grow

504
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:10,960
the water which we use the testing which

505
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:12,879
we do the cleanliness of how we grow

506
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,440
the nutrients that we use that are

507
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
natural

508
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,918
and they and then i literally show them

509
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,319
how to buy in a store

510
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,320
uh how to use a vape pen

511
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,359
i talk about cbd thc and terpenes so you

512
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,798
don't know

513
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,279
you're not only a performer and a

514
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,400

from colombia that were 14 weeks

536
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,279

it went into november and we had three

538

i mean this far i know why

541
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,079

542
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,959
farmers and helps farmers

543
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,279
because it's a [ __ ]

544
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,679
farming is not easy

545
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,079
and when you get

546
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,320
a pre-roll

547
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,399
of a cannabis joint

548
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,200
from my farm

549
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,720
it's been touched

550
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,679
25 times by human hands

551
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,679
from the planting to the pruning to the

552
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,200
harvesting to the curing to the bucking

553
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,320
to the trimming

554
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,880
to the grinding to the and putting it

555
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,279
into the raw wrapper

556
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,799
to the rolling to the packaging to the

557
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,639
ceiling

558
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,440

care

564
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,639
cleanliness because everybody on my farm

566
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,679

588
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,240
the cannabis industry

589
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,038
from medicine to the science of this

590

591
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,679

her heart and my heart aren't the same

593
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,080
mission from god

594
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,720
and

595
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,439
this is great chocolate so anyway

596
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,919
did you have any um

597
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,440
was there a day or

598
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,919
something that happened that made you

599
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,080
be so convinced of cannabis i mean you

600
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,000
were not always into cannabis

601
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,480
so in california where you live it's

602
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,679
legal since six years and medical

603
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,278
medical since i think 10 years about or

604
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,440
even longer

605
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,319
i think yeah sorry i'm sorry

606
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,320
in california yeah um so

607
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,399
well i think everybody starts in this

608
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,839
cannabis business because it's a gold

609
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
rush and you think there's a lot of

610
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,759
money in it

611
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,720
i personally did very well last year

612
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,720
i broke even

613
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,278
home run people are jealous okay i broke

614
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,278
even

615
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,480
and that's with five years of losing so

616
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,400
i know i borrowed you with

617
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,640
everybody on my farm

618
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,798
got paid they made their mortgage

619
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,000

620
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,679
made their car payments they're happy

621
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,159
and that makes me happy because it's a

622
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,600
real family experience on

623
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,200
the

624
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,278
farm

625
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,720
but

626
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,720
there was one moment

627
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,038
when i was in oregon and we did our

628
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,440
first

629
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:08,319
grow our first crop

630
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,480
i literally i still do it i go to

631
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,000
dispensaries myself

632
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
in oregon

633
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,960
and deliver the cannabis

634
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,639
and i do a personal appearance

635
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,400
and there was there was a

636
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,200
parking lot that was filled with people

637
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,440
waiting to meet me

638
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,600
and as i go through the parking lot i

639
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,278
try to say hi to everybody and i can see

640
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,038
inside and

641
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,960
show them the cannabis take photographs

642
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,158
with them you know

643
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,759
by the way that's why i learned

644
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,320
everything about cannabis is from the

645
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,319
consumer

646
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,880
i ran into a gentleman who had long hair

647
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,359
blue blue eyes

648
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,240
skinny and he had a little look on his

649
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,879
face and i just stopped

650
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,880
and i said

651
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:01,359
you are right

652
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,360
and he looked at me and he said you know

653
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,319
i was a medic in iraq

654
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,119
and i saw things that happened to the

655
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,399
human body that nobody

656
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:17,119
should ever witness in their life

657
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,559
i have what the veteran administration

658
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:22,079
said i had triple ptsd

659
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,119
he said i don't know what they mean by

660
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,000
that

661
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:29,678
but they gave me a bottle this big of

662
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,679
600 oxycontin

663
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,720
and i have a wife and kids

664
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,120
and

665
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,919
i can't sleep i can't talk to them

666
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,319
and i was scared of the oxycontin and i

667
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,960
came to cannabis

668
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,960
and he said your strength

669
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,360
black dog

670
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,480
black diamond og

671
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,798
is the only strain i can use

672
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,399
where i can talk to my wife

673
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,720
talk to my children

674
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,719
and sleep

675
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,080
and then he kind of teared up and he

676
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,960
hugged me

677
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:12,798
and i said hey man i didn't make this

678
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,798
and he said no but you're a steward

679
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,919
and that day when i wrote my cousin

680
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,079
chris to our next delivery

681
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,120
i i just was so moved by this man that

682
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,759
was the paradigm shift of why i'm in

683
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,759
this industry

684
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,640
the number one fear in life is death the

685
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,038
number two fear in life is the collapse

686
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,080
of family

687
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:41,759
and families collapse because of

688
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:44,480
a death in a family like mine

689
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:48,158
severe illness someone in the family

690
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,679
divorce a loss of a job

691
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,000
a loss of a home because of that

692
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,759
families collapse

693
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,119
people fight to keep their families

694
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,319
together when they collapse it's

695
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,879
traumatic and i believe that everybody

696
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,480
is suffering from some kind of trauma in

697
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,320
their life that's been guiding their

698
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,640
decisions

699
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,879
and there's if you trace it it's about

700
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,720
some collapse

701
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,559
and when this gentleman was telling me

702
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,960
he was

703
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,440
with that black diamond

704
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,840
and when he consumed it

705
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,840
he was able to participate in his family

706
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,720
again and the fear of the collapse

707
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,720
subsided

708
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,839
but i believe that we all suffer from

709
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
collapse

710
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:36,319
of a family somewhere along the line

711
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,480
and everybody reaches for medicine

712
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,119
everybody is struggling you know people

713
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,558
who are struggling whether it's your

714
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,319
father with dementia or your aunt who

715
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,079
who's suffering

716
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,000
from

717
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,759
arthritis or

718
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,240
a veteran ptsd or divorce or people

719
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,158
suffering laws everybody is struggling

720
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,839
somewhere along the line everybody is

721
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,480
screaming

722
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,278
inside

723
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,519
so they reach for medicine

724
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,000
and what is the medicine

725
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,158
what are our choices

726
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,398
alcohol

727
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,200
number one choice

728
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,199
prescription drugs

729
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,319
going to a doctor

730
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,558
their job is to soothe the symptoms they

731
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,278
just give it to you

732
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,759
all i'm seeing is that the medicine

733
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,798
in cannabis

734
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,398
is a better choice for our bodies

735
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,240
and our spirit

736
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,398
and like i said the medicine is so good

737
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,558
people take it from the side effect

738
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,558
jim what would you say a

739
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,480
european doctor we thought we are not as

740
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,158
far advanced with medical cannabis as

741
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,038
you are in california because we're not

742
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,360
so experienced here

743
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,200
the european doctor would say okay

744
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,519
cannabis has this positive physical

745
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,640
effect and this positive physical effect

746
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,558
uh but the wood enhancing effect is not

747
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,200
therapy what do you agree

748
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,119
well it's not a particle it's not

749
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,440
it's not medical the mood enhancement

750
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,119
what do you mean that's why

751
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,798
what are you talking about yeah what

752
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,959

[ __ ]

00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,619
[Applause]

768
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,000
so mood enhancing

769
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,000
of course it's mood enhancing

770
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,278
that's the point the point of living

771
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,200
through trauma

772
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,960
ptsd or

773
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,360
illness that makes you

774
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,798
feel bad or like even with my wife it

775
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,839
was like

776
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:46,079
it enhanced my mood and

777
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,079
the communication and the relationship

778
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,480
there's nothing wrong with feeling

779
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,759
good

780
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,159
we don't have to feel bad all the time

781
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,119
i mean yes we should be introspective

782
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,799
and

783
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:05,119
we should use those times of

784
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,519
feeling bad to

785
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,199
process the growth

786
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,960
but

787
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
you know

788
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,679
i say [ __ ] you should feel

789
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,679
it's nice to feel good

790
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,640
but again i'm a micro you know i'm i'm

791
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,080
not a

792
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,440
pothead

793
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:26,079
i'm not smoking all day you know

794
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,759
i'm like i take a little bang chocolate

795
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,599
at night

796
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,519
to help me sleep or a little bit of

797
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,199
chocolate or a little cherry pie in the

798
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,278
evening so i don't get in a fight with

799
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,798
my spouse

800
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:40,960
because the day builds anxiety you know

801
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,200
men and women who are responsible for

802
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,759
family

803
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,159
you know trying to raise a family trying

804
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,720
to provide for them you know there's

805
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,880
anxiety with responsibility

806
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,120
and instead of

807
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,799
drinking whiskey

808
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,639
yeah you know take a little bang

809
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,398
chocolate or a little

810
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,399
hit off a joint and

811
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,000
it's peaceful

812
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,959
you know i always said you know i was a

813
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,320
bouncer in chicago you're a bouncer

814
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,800
yes i do

815
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,359
and i never broke up a fight between two

816
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,359
potheads

817
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,398
just drunks

818
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:22,799
so it's a non-violent generous kind

819
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,838
spiritual

820
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,839
mission from god

821
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,559
so what i experienced from the u.s what

822
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:35,838
i do not experience in europe yet there

823
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:38,320
is not such a strict distinction between

824
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,639
medical and recreational it's more like

825
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,240
a yeah

826
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,559
the difference between medical and

827
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,559
recreational united states is taxation

828
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,399
i mean it's all medicine i think

829
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,000
i i i just think it's all medicine so

830
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,159
recreational

831
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,480
you know they tax the hell out of it

832
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,358
and medical the people who really need

833
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,639
it

834
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,719
who take

835
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,960
will take a pound of cannabis and make

836
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,639
their oil out of it in order to help

837
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,000
them with

838
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,879
you know 106 bones that were broken from

839
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,949
a car accident the pain they suffer or

840
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,240
cancer

841
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:21,279
[Music]

842
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,679
you know they give breaks to in taxes

843
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,880
so what our that at least our european

844
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,440
audience might not know in oregon

845
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,519
cannabis for medical use is taxed

846
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,920
differently from recreational cannabis

847
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,159
uh yes

848
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,320
yes absolutely

849
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,159
they're giving they're giving

850
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,559
these medical patients

851
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:47,199
a break on the cost

852
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,199
and also

853
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,800
it's tested

854
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:58,719
and testing is very very it's the

855
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,599
bottom line for cannabis for me uh you

856
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,679
know illegal grows people are making

857
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,200
not all legal growths

858
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,559
some of them are beautiful farmers that

859
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,239
are trying to make a living for their

860
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,039
family

861
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,358
but

862
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,599
you know there's a lot of cartel

863
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,719
or mafia that are involved and they're

864
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,640
growing

865
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,639
auto flower and you know you don't know

866
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,519
what pesticides are using you don't know

867
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,838
the

868
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,079
terpene values the thc valleys you don't

869
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,039
know what it is

870
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,720
so

871
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,559
the the medical cannabis and

872
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:33,039
recreational cannabis is very well

873
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,039
tested so you know what you're consuming

874
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,560
and let's go to

875
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,519
let's go back to south oregon um this is

876
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:45,119
where your farm is and i don't know if

877
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:48,079
the audience knows that icbc is also

878
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,519
coming from south oregon original

879
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,680
from ashland

880
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,519
and yeah actually yeah it's about that's

881
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,399
about 30 minutes from my farm yeah the

882
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:59,039
icbc is born in ashland so to speak alex

883
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,599
rogers who is the ceo of icbc the

884

founder of icbc he lives in he lives in

885
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,838
ashland he comes from ashland that's why

886
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,159
i wanted to say i tried wheat from

887
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,719
southern california and i have to admit

888
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,559
it was it was ground outer it had very

889
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,598
very high thc

890
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,838
levels

891
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,039
and

892
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,838
and it was

893
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:22,880
high on terpenes and it was all bio

894
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:25,199
also there was no no pesticides in and

895
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,000
it was the let me say the best tweet i

896
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,519
had on my trip it is i mean it's it's

897
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,519
going to be and

898
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,759
you know

899
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:37,039
the legalization of the united states

900
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,400
federal legalization is

901
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,440
is a tough

902
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,880
it's a tough road because now

903
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,880
not only have people who don't

904
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,760
understand cannabis and why it should be

905
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,160
legal

906
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,599
fighting it you have states that are

907
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,559
legal

908
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,800
that

909
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,719
are loving the taxation

910
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,560
they taxed the farmer they taxed the

911
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,879
distributor they taxed the dispensary

912
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,838
they taxed the consumer

913
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,640
there's permits licensing

914
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:08,078
you know there's about eight different

915
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,799
revenue streams for the state

916
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,760
so once they legalize it and the state

917
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,760
borders come down

918
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,800
they all know that oregon and northern

919
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,078
california grows the best weed in the

920
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,200
world

921
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,720
and they're

922
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,960
we're going to be shipping it to

923
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:28,319
everybody and they're going no no no no

924
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,838
we don't want to give up all that money

925
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,760
you have to promise to ship some to

926
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,639
germany as well please because oh my god

927
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,040
i can't even see that please i cannot

928
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,358
send anything to germany across state

929
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:43,679
lines that is completely illegal

930
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:46,639
and i am a licensed holder of

931
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:50,319
cannabis wholesale and cultivation

932
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,598
and i am the poster child for compliance

933
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,599
in oregon

934
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,720
i believe that when they give you the

935
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,960
legalization they give you the license

936
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,679
that they are making you their partner

937
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,358
and you have to be an honorable partner

938
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,239
and stay as

939
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,920
legal and compliant as possible and this

940
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,319
partnership will grow

941
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,280
i have no complaints about

942
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,599
the regulations of cannabis

943
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,200
so what do you think is my last question

944
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,480
about uh

945
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,480
cannabis uh

946
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,639
administration things uh what do you

947
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,679
think about federal legalization which

948
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,440
means that you may ship your uh

949
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,199
wheat from hurricane to california one

950
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,200
day is that coming or in that coming

951
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,320
i i feel like it's really close

952
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,720
until

953
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,838
you follow the money

954
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,679
and when you follow the money the states

955
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,440
that are legal i just said this the

956
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,078
states that are legal

957
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,000
want to keep their tax dollars i think i

958
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,240
don't know if they're gonna

959
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,599
i think it's farther down the road than

960
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,199
we'd like but i do think there's a

961
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,920
possibility of them

962
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,239
changing some banking regulations

963
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,200
so they can help the

964
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,879
the dispensaries and the farmers not

965
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,439
deal with so much cash because when

966
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,200
there's a lot of cash around

967
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,760
so welcoming

968
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,759
to cry

969
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,159
and

970
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,760
we talked a lot about oregon about

971
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,838
california but

972
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,800
we are sitting here in spain right now

973
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,719
and spain also has kind of a nice

974
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,200
system for cannabis

975
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,199
because it's decriminalized here and

976
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,280
did you try any spanish i know you're

977
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,599
not a stoner but did you see did you try

978
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,960
to choke

979
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,960
did you see or try i mean

980
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,639

981
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,160
the club yeah and did you enjoy it how

982
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,639

983
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,118
i i enjoyed it the people were very nice

984
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:56,318
reza was very nice vincent the manager

985
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,318
was nice janet

986
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,559
you know in the united states they have

987
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,519
pre-rolls so we've gotten very lazy

988
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,759
and here you have to roll your own

989
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,280
yes

990
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,240
[Laughter]

991
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,920
so janet was very nice to roll the joint

992
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,199
for me

993
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,200
but i didn't partake

994
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,160
my friends did i was surprised of all

995
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,639
the europeans mixing tobacco with the

996
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,838

had that from american surprisingly well

999
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,039
you know when i was 16 we used to take a

1000
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,119
little weed

1001
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,679
we'd take a cigarette and we'd kind of

1002
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,640
roll out the tobacco and

1003
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,639
put the weed into the cigarette to smoke

1004
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,440
it so i don't know

1005
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,440
well i i started smoking in the u.s

1006
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,440
when i was 16.

1007
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,480
our first cannabis experience

1008
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,000
in the us

1009
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,079
and uh

1010
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,159

00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,000
cannabis it's a it's a that deadly sin

1017
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,000
considered as a deadly sin i thought

1018
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,159
really yeah i thought well that's pretty

1019
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,280
self-righteous of them you know what i

1020
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,759
say

1021
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,280

1024
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:25,358
want to that's [ __ ] okay finally did

1025
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,799
i lose anybody

1026
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,519
jamie you're still here you're not being

1027
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,160
offended by that okay

1028
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:34,318
sure man i hate offending people

1029
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,920
bullshit's a big big word

1030
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,719
you know i mean i think consume it the

1031
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,838
way you'd like i mean uh everybody has

1032
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,759
their

1033
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,838
preference just like

1034
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,520
so don't worry i don't really like

1035
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:49,039
watching somebody put

1036
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,960
ketchup on their scrambled eggs

1037
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,440
and i do the same thing how can you put

1038
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,039
ketchup on your scrambled eggs

1039
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,599
and they're like

1040
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,039
shut the [ __ ] up belushi

1041
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,599
you eat your eggs the way you want to

1042
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,480
eat them all right all right all right

1043
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,800
so you don't think there's a necessity

1044
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,920
to over regulate anything on cannabis or

1045
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,359
to uh regulate it too

1046
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,880
too detailed

1047
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,000
but i didn't quite understand what you

1048
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,838
asked

1049
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
what did you say

1050
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,400
i asked you if you think there's if

1051
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,318
there's a tendency to over regulate

1052
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,200
cannabis

1053
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,679
and recreational medical cannabis to do

1054
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,000
to have two strong rules i don't know i

1055
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,919
you know i i do believe states like

1056
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,800
colorado

1057
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
and oregon

1058
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,440
even washington

1059
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:44,159
they've been in the game for a long time

1060
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,079
and especially oregon they're very

1061
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:50,639
amenable to understanding cannabis

1062
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,760
and they change their regulations as

1063
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:52,879
they

1064
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,400
grow

1065
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,920
with the understanding

1066
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,920
of the cannabis recreational market

1067
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,119
i think states like california

1068
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,440
should have

1069
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,440
talked to oregon

1070
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,760
and colorado i think they did talk to

1071
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,760
him but said yeah we're california we're

1072
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,160
going to do the way we want to do and

1073
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,599
their regulations are very conflicting

1074
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,598
and

1075
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,079
and the taxation and some of the

1076
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,039
regulation is

1077
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,519
it's just anti-productive at times and

1078
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,119
there's a movement

1079
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,318
to try to get them to straighten it out

1080
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,920
but they're a little stubborn

1081
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,920
california's

1082
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,720
i'm not even in the california market

1083
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,559
because it's just

1084
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,480
it's a little screwy right now but

1085
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,199
hopefully they'll get it

1086
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,079
so

1087
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,078
anyway europe should look at oregon and

1088
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,839
colorado and

1089
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,318
see how they do it

1090
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:50,880
because the testing and the safety and

1091
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:53,279
the protocols and the metric

1092
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,960
the tracking is

1093
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,599
sensible

1094
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,440
and responsible and protects the

1095
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,800
consumer

1096
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,159
okay i think that was a very good final

1097
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,318
word and yeah we are close to finish we

1098
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,199
are close to yeah it's we're nearly

1099
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:10,159
finished

1100
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,078
um

1101
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,679
is there anything you want to tell the

1102
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,760
audience before i think i've been

1103
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,440
telling you

1104
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,119
anything else anything special anything

1105
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,440
special what's your best train for

1106
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,440
example well i would like you to see

1107
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,200
growing belushi

1108
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,480
uh is it's a wonderful show and

1109
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:32,399
simpatico to our cause

1110
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,280
and purpose

1111
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,160
um

1112
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,760
on discovery plus and

1113
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,559
i'm looking forward to walking through

1114
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,000
the convention tomorrow

1115
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,000
bain chocolate will be there

1116
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:51,759
uh lighting which is an led

1117
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:54,879
uh lighting system that we just put into

1118
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,440
our grow that increased our growth

1119
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,240
the yield by 30 percent and the terpene

1120
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,280
values so you do a hybrid growth lights

1121
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:07,039
and soil we're in the soil

1122
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,440
uh beds we're in beds in a greenhouse

1123
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:11,358
i couldn't take the aphids

1124
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,559
and the rustic mites anymore and the

1125
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,119
gophers

1126
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,960
so i went into greenhouse because

1127
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,440
greenhouse still has

1128
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,440
the spirituality and the power of the

1129
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,838
father's son

1130
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,079
uh but it's also a nice protected

1131
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,239
environment from the elements

1132
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,960
and we're having great success in this

1133
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:33,519
this lighting system

1134
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,559
and we switched to advanced nutrients

1135
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,759
which

1136
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,599
really

1137
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,640
really

1138
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,519
i'm very pleased at

1139
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,480
the results because

1140
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:49,519
the results aren't subtle

1141
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,719
it's like this last greenhouse we grew

1142
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,880
with

1143
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,159
advanced nutrients next to our other

1144
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,440
greenhouse

1145
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:59,838
was like i'm on two different farms

1146
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,559
so this this this nutrient advanced

1147
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:02,559
nutrients is

1148
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,039
spectacular

1149
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,239
so you know between the light

1150
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:10,480
the sun

1151
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,719
and the nutrients and of course the

1152
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,679
water we use from our river

1153
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:18,879
we believe we're growing the

1154
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:21,199
some of the finest cannabis

1155
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,039
uh in oregon

1156
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,399
i believe that uh

1157
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,239
but you know what

1158
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,440
every grower says that so don't listen

1159
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,439
to me

1160
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,720
i'm i'm i'm i'm full of [ __ ] i'm

1161
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,400

yes

1168
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,719
hello

1169
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,799
i have a question i've written it down

1170
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,799
so i don't forget it so as a

1171
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,880
high-profile cannabis farmer to what

1172
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,880
extent do you feel a responsibility i

1173
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,358
guess for one of a better term to kind

1174
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,960
of push the legalization agenda sort of

1175
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:10,078
in the u.s and internationally

1176
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,000
i'd leave that to steve de angelo

1177
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,760
steve d'angelo is the godfather of

1178
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,760
cannabis united states and he is really

1179
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,079
the most articulate and active guy

1180
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,559
i'm still chasing gophers

1181
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:27,039
but i do believe in the last prisoners

1182
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,160
project when steve started

1183
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:32,960
the united states which is

1184
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,358
a program where we are working

1185
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,079
diligently with lawyers

1186
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:40,880
states attorneys to release

1187
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,480
some of the 40 000

1188
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,400
non-violent

1189
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,960
cannabis

1190
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,440
people that are incarcerated and we've

1191
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,800
been having some great success

1192
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,240
but these men and women that are

1193
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,119
incarcerated

1194
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,279
we're the pioneers in our business

1195
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,720
and they are in jail with collapsed

1196
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,559
families

1197
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,879
because when someone is incarcerated it

1198
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,319
collapses their family

1199
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,119
and we are

1200
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,880
making money on that you know

1201
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,400
somebody's telling a better joke than me

1202
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,400
out there i don't know

1203
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,318
who that might be but they're having a

1204
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,838
good time

1205
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:19,759
they must be dabbing

1206
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:23,440
did that help

1207
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,200
any other questions right here yeah

1208
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,480
thank you jim for this

1209
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,558
passionate

1210
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,838
statement on cannabis

1211
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,240
you you say mood and enhancing i really

1212
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,440
like it i really love it

1213
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:40,399
but my question is will you be ready

1214
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,599
to support maybe a trial a clinical

1215
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,200
trial

1216
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,640
to prove it

1217
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,679
according to the principle of

1218
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:50,000
evidence-based medicine as known in the

1219
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,039
scientific world for a while

1220
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,719
i mean

1221
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:55,599
we know that i i want to take the

1222
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,838
example of aspirin

1223
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,079
120

1224
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:03,440
years and for the last decades

1225
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,839
around about one billion dollars sales

1226
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,240
average sales per year

1227
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:11,519
so making something like that

1228
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:14,959
could give the pot the possibility

1229
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,480
to make sales worldwide and support

1230
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,599
lots of people

1231
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,559
who need who need that we know that okay

1232
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,160
and we

1233
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:28,559
all of us are convinced that cannabis

1234
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:30,639
really have lots of of of potential

1235
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,040
so if you could be

1236
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,358
the one supporting some something like

1237
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,480
that and and you know and make this

1238
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,480
revolution happen

1239
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,519
i don't quite understand that long

1240
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,399
question

1241
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:46,800
um

1242
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,920
would i support the legalization of

1243
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,920
medical cannabis

1244
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,920
expanded testing what is it expanded

1245
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,599
testing for cannabis to put it on equal

1246
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,960
footing would say

1247
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,240
that would be great i don't know what

1248
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,400
the laws are

1249
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:07,318
here in europe but you know the united

1250
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,318
states because it's federally illegal

1251
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,679
uh

1252
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,279
people that receive their licenses from

1253
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,440
the federal government

1254
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,599
doctors

1255
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,838
if they dabble in cannabis

1256
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,800
they can lose their license

1257
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:22,799
so

1258
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,240
most doctors don't even know the medical

1259
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,160
benefits

1260
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:27,519
you know they have

1261
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:29,920
12

1262
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,679
informative seminars a year on all

1263
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,358
different kinds of drugs but there's not

1264
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,719
one for cannabis

1265
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,199
they don't even know what to recommend

1266
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,799
to their patient with brightest

1267
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,078
cannabis they wouldn't do it because

1268
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,519
they'd be frightened to lose their

1269
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,160
license

1270
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,358
so the testing is really

1271
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,759
behind

1272
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:50,000
but there is some headway

1273
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,119
what i can say for europe in europe we

1274
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,440
have

1275
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,960
we have testing is regulated by

1276
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,960
by

1277
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,760
the federal government

1278
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,838
mostly it's the same in

1279
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,000
in countries as a medical color with the

1280
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,719
legal medical cannabis they test it for

1281
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,960
thc in germany and in other countries

1282
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,480
for cbd

1283
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,880
for mold

1284
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,280
and that's about it

1285
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,358
you can as a company you can test it for

1286
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,519
two of turpins and you also can test it

1287
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:24,318
as a company for other

1288
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:27,280
cannabinoids but you are not allowed to

1289
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:30,159
publish those results because it's a

1290
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,000
medicine and you're not allowed to

1291
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,000
make advertisement for a medicine in

1292
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,679
germany and due to that you're not

1293
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,400
allowed you lost them

1294
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:37,838
too

1295
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,039
we lost them

1296
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,039
but i didn't say [ __ ]

1297
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:47,279

1298
