kind of put them on the spot and find

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,890
out some of what I know is burning in

15

people's minds first I'll just give you

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,399
a little background if I see a lot of

17
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:55,280
familiar faces people that have been in

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,310
the industry for a long time over 25

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,140
years ago when I was discovering

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,450
cannabis getting out of high school and

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,569
learning what I liked about it for

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,430
recreational purposes then my mother

23
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:09,319
came down with cancer and my best

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,950
friend's mother got HIV from a blood

25
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,209
transfusion and in the 90s HIV was still

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,649
very mysterious and we weren't

27
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:18,919
understanding what was up and people

28
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:20,510
were afraid to hug or kiss her or and I

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,909
I knew a little more about it and and

30
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,350
was very involved with trying to help

31
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,120
her feel better he was a very good

32
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,408
friend of mine and and then both of our

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,100
moms were going through this traumatic

34
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:33,950
period we lost his mom and my mom

35
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,379
survived twice breast cancer and as a

36
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,400
been around a long time still trucking

37
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:42,949
along and we're both one was pro

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,540
cannabis and one wasn't and my mom had

39
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,909
never smoked cannabis and ever been

40
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,500
around cannabis and did not want me to

41
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,850
be around cannabis so it was hard for me

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,799
to come at her and explain how

43
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:54,349
beneficial this could be mom I see this

44
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,640
as helping people I have some good

45
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,129
friends that took me down to San

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,680
Francisco on a trip and introduced me to

47
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:03,798
some crazy wild guys that were talking

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,350
about hemp and and cannabis and some of

49
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,469
you might know jack herer is heard of

50
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:11,430
Jack God rest his soul give Jack a round

51
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,590
of applause we miss jack

52
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,319
[Music]

53
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,750
and crazy ed Rosenthal who taught me how

54
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,549
to grow cannabis when I did know how so

55
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,620
I could try and provide my mother with a

56
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,630
product that was gonna help her get

57
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,969
through her problems for the last 25

58
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,219
years or so I worked with voter power

59
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:33,409
the organization and Anthony Johnson was

60
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:35,750
there with me in the streets with

61
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:38,840
clipboards getting signatures to put a

62
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,729
medical ballot on the Oregon initiative

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,209
system and and we did that and

64
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:47,719
eventually got the original OMA past and

65
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:49,459
through voter power I learned about what

66
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,889
medical clinics meant and what outreach

67
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,269
meant to patients and what we had to do

68
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:55,009
to help these people and it wasn't just

69
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,590
my mom it was everybody's mom and

70
00:02:55,009 --> 00:03:00,919
grandma and uncles and and brothers and

71
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,150
so we worked hard to try and get focused

72
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,159
on that they really taught me how to

73
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,989
organize and rally around these people

74
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,759
to get them what they needed on the

75
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,409
product line and to teach growers how to

76
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,049
provide for patients and provide for

77
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:16,250
their family members which is the key to

78
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,140
this whole system working so we started

79
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,280
doing clinics I eventually left voter

80
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:22,009
power started Southern Oregon

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,289
alternative medicine were in about 16

82
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,000
cities in Oregon I started Arizona

83
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:27,229
alternative health I had an uncle down

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,239
there I went down and wanted to do the

85
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:31,988
same thing for people they're very tough

86
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,280
state in the beginning let me tell you

87
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,890
but it was it was tough I mean I

88
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,150
remember getting spat on and and people

89
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,979
wanted a fist fight because we were

90
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,930
getting signatures to put cannabis on

91
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:44,030
the ballot and and Southern Oregon was

92
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,530
not you know the most friendly area even

93
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,030
though that's where some of the best

94
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,009
cannabis in the world was grown in the

95
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,930
woods we'd often wait for hours to go up

96
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:52,699
and have to by the time I'd go get an

97
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,170
ounce in the woods by the time I got

98
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,548
home it would take a whole day and the

99
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,619
two people that would introduce me to

100
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,569
the next people to get it and never met

101
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,359
the guy and I mean all of you remember

102
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,250
these these early stories of how we got

103
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,590
our cannabis and fell in love with it

104
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,090
and and I fell in love with it and I

105
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,879
blew blast for a long time

106
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,310
and was just wanted to do anything close

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,038
to the industry but helping people and

108
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,389
seeing the satisfaction and watching

109
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,978
people's lives be better that are

110
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,500
suffering through traumatic illnesses

111
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:23,478
and traumatic times in their lives

112
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,620
losing family members and getting

113
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,089
through that was the biggest part of

114
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,329
my life and been the joy of my life to

115
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,769
work with patients a few years ago a

116
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:34,259
friend of mine in Southern Oregon I have

117
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:36,389
a restaurant down there a friend of mine

118
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:41,219
came in that had just been appointed to

119
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,990
the olcc as chairman Rob Patridge who's

120
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,370
not with the agency anymore but was

121
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,629
elected by former governor Kitzhaber to

122
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,090
handle that stuff and he came to me and

123
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:53,610
said hey he was a former prosecutor so

124
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,409
he was a Klamath DA and all he knew

125
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,300
about cannabis was going into a farm

126
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,520
cutting the plants down and arresting

127
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,139
everybody on site so there was a little

128
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,939
bit different angle for him to come and

129
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,009
and told me hey I don't know anything

130
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,410
about this we got to do this we helped

131
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,300
me do this and so that's when we started

132
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,760
forming the rules advisory committee and

133
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,900
getting a lot of great people in the

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,240
industry that have been around a long

135
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,219
time that understand how it goes and one

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,970
thing I can say about the agency is

137
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,490
they've done

138
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,490
absolutely their best and with limited

139
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,410
resources and limited funding to not

140
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,050
only pay attention to this massive

141
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,240
undertaking of creating a regulated

142
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,770
market around cannabis which is you know

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,740
what a long strange trip it's been I

144
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:36,478
often repeat to myself it's just a trip

145
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,699
to see where we're at to see an

146
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,409
organized convention like this organized

147
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,209
business people getting involved and

148
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,060
taking it to the next level is super

149
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,799
exciting there's a lot of challenges I

150
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,228
think the agency is doing a good job of

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,478
with what they have to hear us and they

152
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:52,649
did a statewide listening tour in the

153
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,359
beginning and went around and really

154
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:57,269
wanted to hear what we thought it should

155
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,590
look like and some things turned out the

156
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,000
way we thought they should be some

157
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,728
things didn't and I think we're learning

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,589
as industry people some of these things

159
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:06,750
are for the best the tracking system

160
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,549
sayings that we never did when we were

161
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,829
growing for years keeping track of what

162
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,569
nutrients we were using or what what was

163
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,759
potentially a better strain than another

164
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,379
you know it was all just not organized

165
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,469
now we're organizing these things where

166
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,149
were able to operate in the open which

167
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,729
is great I think you know the black

168
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,769
market was the way it was the black

169
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:28,110
market was how people made money that's

170
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:31,228
how we had to make money to be able to

171
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,598
make medicine for people the day Pfizer

172
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:35,279
starts making pills for free then then I

173
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:38,189
would say growers should be able to grow

174
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,888
for free so this new introduction into

175
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,529
where

176
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,060
medical patients and medical growers are

177
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,679
gonna be able to participate in the

178
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,999
recreational system and we're going to

179
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,180
talk about that a little bit Steve

180
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:50,889
talked about it a bit it's a complicated

181
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,028
thing to make people understand

182
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,620
something we've been doing in the

183
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:55,870
program for over you know around 20

184
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,999
years now all of a sudden now it's a big

185
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,158
shift and patients and growers that are

186
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,289
in that realm don't deal with the

187
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:04,870
changes as easy as others so we're

188
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:08,019
trying to find some balance in between

189
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,399
and I think Oregon by far and people

190
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,468
have heard me say this before but I

191
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,508
think we are the number one state in the

192
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:15,098
country that has legalized cannabis and

193
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,710
protected our medical patients and

194
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:19,839
growers far beyond anyone elses programs

195
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:22,299
and you know I mean that's a big deal

196
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,000
it's a big deal to know that these

197
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,819
people sitting here even they don't have

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,449
to they're not dictated necessarily to

199
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,129
care

200
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,740
they're dictated to do something about

201
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:34,120
what the legislature says to do but I

202
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,158
know these people I know them personally

203
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,990
I know they care I know they do want to

204
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:39,490
find a way for us to be able to take

205
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,889
care of our patients and keep them in

206
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,360
the mix Rob Patridge understood that how

207
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:45,400
important it was to take care of the

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,069
people who this industry was built on

209
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,989
this industry was built around sick and

210
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,098
disabled people and the growers and

211
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,810
caregivers that were compassionate

212
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:58,060
enough to take it on and risk

213
00:07:52,810 --> 00:08:00,129
imprisonment a lot of times so I think

214
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,199
where we're at now from where we've been

215
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:04,360
is light-years I think we have a long

216
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,218
way to go with great legislators we have

217
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,379
some of them here I'm sitting with us

218
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:10,389
that are keeping our voices heard at the

219
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,129
legislative level which gives them the

220
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:15,579
tools they need at the administrative

221
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,259
level to make these things happen some

222
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,060
of the frustrating things we've seen as

223
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,889
a multiple license holder I've got

224
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,870
stores I understand the challenges of

225
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,399
stores I understand where farmers are

226
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,319
and we got to pay our crew at the end of

227
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,968
the harvest season we know the

228
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,560
challenges around stores being too many

229
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:31,658
stores a lot of us feel like there's too

230
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,979
many and so those sort of the kind of

231
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:34,838
things that we have to be vocal about

232
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,849
and I encourage you to be vocal with

233
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,190
your legislators and the legislators you

234
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,750
know that are in the realm of this stuff

235
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,640
senator Pierzynski is sitting with us

236
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,658
today been one of our great champions

237
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,439
let's give him a round of applause

238
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:46,439
really quick I just

239
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:53,320
Floyd has been awesome and really

240
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,120
hearing what the challenges are and

241
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,620
staying with it a lot of letters leaders

242
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,090
have kind of come and gone we've lost

243
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,310
our committee that was a group of

244
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,629
legislators deemed to kind of handle

245
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,579
this stuff and now we're back in the

246
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,049
open waters again and it has to be

247
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,790
included in something that they want to

248
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:09,129
do and they have obviously constituents

249
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:11,439
that want many things handled you know

250
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,659
land usage things cannabis is not the

251
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,030
top thing for every legislator so the

252
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:18,309
fact that people like senator Pierzynski

253
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,569
still find time and and realize how

254
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:21,219
important it is that we shape this

255
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,920
industry the right way and that happens

256
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,620
through what he does at his job and it

257
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,360
lets them do their job and you know we

258
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,470
can get that middle ground and I think

259
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,720
we're getting there I see I know

260
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,350
businesses are struggling it's a really

261
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,570
challenging time we're held to one state

262
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,570
I mean you have an open market concept

263
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,420
in a single state for sales I mean once

264
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,830
federal change happens is really what

265
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,199
we're all kind of hovering and waiting

266
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,180
for and unfortunately a lot of the

267
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,950
smaller outfits which is who we want to

268
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,959
support we want those small family farms

269
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,730
and I do think there's a future people

270
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,379
ask me all the time I'm a small business

271
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,509
how am I going to compete with those big

272
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,820
dollars coming in from Canada you know I

273
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,039
think we're in a microbrew industry you

274
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,860
know we really are it's a it's the new

275
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,139
era of where that mom-and-pop product

276
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,970
that organic farm those things are

277
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,460
important and those are what consumers

278
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,860
are looking for so if you have a small

279
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,230
business you have a small farm brand

280
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,330
yourself well I always say it's really

281
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,620
important you to stand out on the store

282
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,540
shelves that's how you're gonna get your

283
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,070
product out there there is a lot of

284
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,559
people growing flower but flower is

285
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,210
selling it is selling and once we get

286
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,449
more licenses on and they're working

287
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,190
vigilantly to get that done the new

288
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,780
processors that come online the new

289
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,790
product lines that come out you see how

290
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,409
many products are in the store now would

291
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:40,000
go into a 7-eleven or go into a liquor

292
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,829
store or whatever reference you want to

293
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,779
use there's a lot of room for product

294
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,030
development and that's really where that

295
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:48,009
cannabis is gonna be eaten up so as we

296
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,419
create new oil lines and new product

297
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,830
lines and all these great ideas that

298
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:53,169
people are coming up with we're gonna

299
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,400
see that reduction happen even in Oregon

300
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:56,319
I think we're gonna see cannabis

301
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,909
starting to be eaten up more and it'll

302
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,379
drive the prices back up a little bit

303
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,909
once we go

304
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,829
federal legal obviously that's the

305
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:04,328
launch point so right now you're

306
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,798
preparing yourself for what's gonna

307
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:08,258
happen you're preparing yourself to be

308
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:10,358
relevant on a national marketplace and

309
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,308
that should really be your focus right

310
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:13,899
now is doing your product doing it well

311
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:16,568
and knowing how to scale when the time

312
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,519
comes I assume when the time comes and

313
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,978
we can't ship out of state we'll look

314
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,479
back at the rules and regs around how

315
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:24,849
big a farm can be and we'll go from an

316
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:27,158
acre to potentially 20 acres or whatever

317
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:29,259
it takes as we see that product able to

318
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:30,249
move right now we keep that acre that's

319
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:32,499
not gonna be like that forever

320
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:34,239
eventually you will be able to grow you

321
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:36,729
know massive fields of cannabis as the

322
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,559
demand will be there where right now

323
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,989
we're just kind of held to this state

324
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:42,308
and it's a like a hovering game so we

325
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:44,229
just need to hang out I don't want to

326
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:46,478
see I've really it discourages me to see

327
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:48,970
people giving up I know it's financially

328
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:51,879
difficult not to in some instances I've

329
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,379
dealt with all that myself but we got to

330
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,819
hang in there because those ideas that

331
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,019
you have and those products are the

332
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:57,248
future this is the end of prohibition

333
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,019
all over again

334
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,149
if you look at those signs and what's

335
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,918
happening you'll see this is how it went

336
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:04,989
not everybody made it but a lot of

337
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:06,519
people did make it and it's not the same

338
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:08,769
it's not gonna be a big corporate shift

339
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,479
I think the small family farm and the

340
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,970
small product manufacturer definitely

341
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:15,069
has a place so I'm looking forward to

342
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,928
see how that kind of turns out so stay

343
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,908
in there hang in there and then let's

344
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:22,778
give these guys a little bit of heat

345
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:24,568
here so a couple questions that I got so

346
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:26,619
Danica I'm going to put this one to you

347
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:28,208
from what I've been hearing quite a few

348
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:30,249
like the violations could have been

349
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:33,428
avoided by licensees reporting changes

350
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,769
to olcc can you let us know what the

351
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:39,028
common violations are and what licenses

352
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,028
need to let olcc know

353
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,120
is that on

354
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,980
tryam andis

355
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,420
it's not better that's better there you

356
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:15,360
go okay there's no secret that this

357
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,099
market is an incredibly dynamic but

358
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,440
difficult phase right now we took a very

359
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,000
free-market approach in Oregon here so

360
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,850
over the last couple of years a lot of

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,710
licensees coming on board and I think it

362
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,060
was not unexpected that at some point

363
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,340
there would be somewhat of a glut in the

364
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:32,219
market too many licensees too much

365
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,290
product prices go down and businesses

366
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,310
are struggling there's a lot of people

367
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:38,039
that are trying to bring on new

368
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:40,829
investors selling out their businesses a

369
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,000
lot of consolidation going on or trying

370
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,950
to scale up or scale down their

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,440
operations within the premises that

372
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:49,259
they've licensed all of that are things

373
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,820
that require licensing attention it's

374
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,009
one of the reasons why we shifted a lot

375
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,080
of our focus from new applications to be

376
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,879
able to serve those existing licensees

377
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,370
and help them get through this this

378
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,620
phase of the industry but that is where

379
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,750
we're seeing a lot of businesses that

380
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,639
are not following the regulations and it

381
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,990
is it is concerning because in order to

382
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:12,179
keep this market dynamic continue to let

383
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,769
it evolve and grow we need to be able to

384
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,389
make sure that we are vetting the people

385
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,370
that are coming into it that we know

386
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:19,500
that premises that are being licensed

387
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,049
and we know what's happening on those

388
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,389
licensed premises so all of those things

389
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:25,679
making changes to a premises making

390
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,269
changes to your business structure

391
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,519
selling your business all of that

392
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,809
requires olcc pre-approval and that's

393
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,100
what we're really not seeing a lot of

394
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,979
right now we're seeing a lot of people

395
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,000
come in after the fact and frankly a lot

396
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,430
of those things can actually be

397
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,889
cancelable offenses so if you are a

398
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:42,479
licensee or you know a licensee please

399
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,980
help us get the word out that you know

400
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,480
we're there to help you we have a

401
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,490
process under which you can let us know

402
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,840
that you're making those changes and we

403
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,700
want to get them done for you as quickly

404
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,370
as possible but it does it is something

405
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,900
that you need to contact us first work

406
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,120
through that process and do it the right

407
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,829
way

408
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,990
okay great one thing I think you know

409
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:04,080
and I talked about a little bit about

410
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,669
licensees or I think it is important to

411
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,710
let the agency know when these changes

412
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:09,000
happen it's super important to let them

413
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,150
know ahead of time I think there's still

414
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,299
some fear of people maybe making changes

415
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,769
that they're not ready for and I want to

416
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,029
get the message out that people need to

417
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,289
call the agency and let them know if

418
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:19,860
you're having a problem you need to let

419
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,929
them know they

420
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,919
know about it if you're having one topic

421
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,778
I've been talking to them about his

422
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,399
camera issues we've had a lot of canna

423
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:27,838
Guard and a lot of the companies kind of

424
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,289
disappeared and left a lot of growers

425
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,390
and and other licenses in the lurch what

426
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:34,769
do you think you know is the best method

427
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,208
for people to communicate with the

428
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,070
agency because ultimately that's what we

429
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,149
want we want people to call talk to you

430
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,560
guys about the problems they're having

431
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:42,360
and know that they're not going to be

432
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:51,119
put on the chopping block

433
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:53,579
when it comes to that right email that

434
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,528
you can send any question to it will get

435
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,328
to the right person we have staff that

436
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:58,649
read every single one of those emails we

437
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:00,000
have a call-in line that I don't

438
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:02,370
remember the number right now but we can

439
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,750
get it if you we have a booth here so

440
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,919
please stop by and get any information

441
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,879
that you need it's we really want people

442
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,429
to call and ask

443
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,740
there is no too small of a question out

444
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,419
there we can usually help you work

445
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,940
through whatever process whatever issue

446
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,860
you've got if you just contact us I

447
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,399
think that's important for people to

448
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,470
know

449
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,000
thank you Danica I think it's important

450
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,528
that people know that the agency is

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,659
ready to work with you they want us to

452
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:29,399
be successful they are not here to

453
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,819
prevent us from being you know

454
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,409
successful and I see a lot of fear with

455
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,839
clients I work with and people in the

456
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:39,719
industry that you cannot at this point

457
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,459
see the agency as the enemy in your

458
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,290
process and they understand that there's

459
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,909
fears around that so I encourage people

460
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:46,500
to reach out to the agency when you have

461
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:48,028
in problems let them know what you're

462
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,559
having make sure that you're keeping

463
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:51,480
good records of everything that's going

464
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,649
on and you'll find a way around that and

465
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,850
they'll help you find a way around that

466
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:56,750
it's gonna make your life easier and

467
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,750
you're gonna sleep better I promise

468
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:03,060
Jesse I got one for you buddy has almost

469
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:05,279
Susy been able to make it to most of the

470
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:09,928
outdoor producers who are harvesting in

471
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,609
this new operation good harvest and are

472
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,230
you finding common violations when those

473
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:16,289
people are going out to those type of

474
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,568
sites and does olcc plan to do similar

475
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,889
good harvest stuff with the indoor

476
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:22,369
growers and not just the outdoor

477
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,370
producers

478
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:29,569
as Steve touched on we're out there

479
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,880
doing harvest notice inspections we have

480
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:33,619
done approximately 60 of these

481
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,000
inspections so far and I think we're

482
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:40,009
looking at about a 70% successful

483
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,900
compliance rate and what we're seeing

484
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:44,930
when we're out there is not necessarily

485
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,290
problems with the harvest or the harvest

486
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:52,100
notification process itself what's more

487
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:55,009
common is we're seeing operational

488
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:59,990
problems things like the fencing isn't

489
00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:01,789
in place or you know growers are drying

490
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,799
in a facility that's not approved and

491
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,829
doesn't have cameras things that we

492
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:10,700
would have caught in any kind of routine

493
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:13,429
inspection and the the harvest

494
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,940
notification process has I think been a

495
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:19,039
really good tool for our staff to to get

496
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,980
organized and get mobilized out to those

497
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:25,369
growers who they in many cases haven't

498
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,710
visited for quite some time and what

499
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:30,619
we're seeing mostly falls along the

500
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,220
lines of people who just aren't paying

501
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:36,169
enough attention to compliance and the

502
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,529
operational standards that we have in

503
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:42,050
our rules this is a really really tough

504
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:44,680
industry you know it's tough for a lot

505
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:50,569
of reasons that that you all know

506
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:52,820
banking taxes competition it's also

507
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:54,980
tough because we have put forth a lot of

508
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,369
regulations and and we know that and

509
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,410
we're working with the industry to to

510
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,959
get people compliant to get them to

511
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,610
where they need to be and in some cases

512
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,710
when we can't get people there we have

513
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:09,439
to pursue license cancellation I'll

514
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,720
reiterate what Brent said you know

515
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,930
there's the saying ask for forgiveness

516
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,559
not permission that does not work in

517
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,670
this industry it simply doesn't you need

518
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,490
to ask for permission

519
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:27,110
as far as indoor growers you know we're

520
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,140
focusing on the outdoor growers right

521
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:31,809
now because we are in harvest

522
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,360
we've got a large amount of product

523
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:35,649
coming down in a very short window I'm

524
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,990
going to use the rest of the year

525
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,000
following this harvest season to start

526
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,190
getting out and making more contact with

527
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,130
the indoor growers so that we can do the

528
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,420
same types of premises inspections to

529
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,230
ensure that they're operating in

530
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,640
compliance great yeah that's a lot of

531
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,589
work it's a lot of work with a limited

532
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,360
staff I've seen them do some pretty

533
00:19:53,589 --> 00:20:00,039
amazing things with not very many people

534
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,809
okay Jesse Jesse we were talking a

535
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,970
little bit ago and kind of describes

536
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,769
himself as the designated driver at the

537
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,009
end of the night that's the only silver

538
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:10,539
one in the vehicle he's got a really

539
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,339
hard task there's a lot of these things

540
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:13,809
I throw at him constantly we're trying

541
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:17,139
to figure out how to make what we've

542
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:19,299
done forever work with what they

543
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,890
understand they need to do it doesn't

544
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,399
always make sense we don't always

545
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,750
understand how that looks but they're

546
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,370
trying to understand and they're trying

547
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,309
to find a way in the regulatory process

548
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:33,099
to allow us to do our job when we looked

549
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,929
at some of you may have saw the big pile

550
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,480
of burning marijuana that I had a couple

551
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,980
years ago kind of went national Bob and

552
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,220
Tom called me about it but it was all

553
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,630
about moldy cannabis and what that

554
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,610
looked like and in the beginning a lot

555
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,060
of these rules and regulations came from

556
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:50,859
what they knew metric came from Colorado

557
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,599
they only understood indoor grows they

558
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:55,029
wanted us to cut a whole plant and hang

559
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,889
it upside down when we harvest once I

560
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:58,029
showed them what plants look like they

561
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,910
understood why that probably wasn't

562
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:03,129
going to work you know out ten pound

563
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,190
outdoor plants don't do that not without

564
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,140
a smoke crane so but they came down they

565
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,299
came to the farms we did tours of many

566
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,250
farms and saw what that looks like and

567
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:13,869
why there is moldy material and why we

568
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,029
do have waste on a farm and this is a

569
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:18,069
farm this is a farm like any other farm

570
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:19,539
we have lots of biomass that we end up

571
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,339
burning getting rid of that goes on the

572
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,899
ground and it's not a valuable product

573
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:24,909
that we're trying to send out to the

574
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,280
masses through the black market it's

575
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,230
it's waste and they understood that and

576
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,809
the rules now reflect that and that's

577
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,400
how the whole process has been going

578
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:34,359
through showing them what's happening

579
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,160
they want to see what we're talking

580
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,619
about and that's why this communication

581
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,259
is so important giving them ideas of

582
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:42,129
what your challenges are helps them find

583
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,990
a way around

584
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,030
and that's why I try and stay so active

585
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,558
and letting them know any information I

586
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:48,940
can that's gonna help them do their job

587
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:52,928
better which makes our lives much easier

588
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,850
when things are running smooth so Jessie

589
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm gonna throw one more at you buddy it

590
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,609
seems like the OCC has been holding

591
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,830
quite a few rules advisory committee

592
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:01,750
meetings as we did on the sales limits

593
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:04,029
recently what are the main topics you're

594
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,069
focused on and when should we expect

595
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:09,910
some kind of finalization in the rule

596
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:13,058
process so to answer this I'll start at

597
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,700
the beginning in late 2015 the agency

598
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:17,950
adopted close to a hundred pages of

599
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,960
administrative rules before we issued a

600
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,990
single license

601
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:28,840
so obviously that first rule package was

602
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:31,450
not perfect we have undergone since that

603
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:34,480
time major revisions in the legislature

604
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,880
and the agency and its rulemaking has

605
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,470
devoted most of its resources to keeping

606
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,900
up with the legislative changes rather

607
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,350
than going back and fine-tuning that

608
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,570
base package based on what we have

609
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:49,359
learned from both our staff working in

610
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:53,079
the field and from input people in the

611
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:55,959
industry so we're going to have a very

612
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:59,619
broad package of rules coming through

613
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,679
this fall it will likely be adopted by

614
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:05,979
our Commission in December we have a lay

615
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:09,100
Commission and they are the final policy

616
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,750
makers staff like me draft things and

617
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:15,519
suggest things to them but they

618
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:18,190
ultimately guide the policy so the those

619
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,558
rules will focus as I said on a number

620
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:26,169
of refinements some of the major subject

621
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:28,899
matter areas are volatile processing we

622
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:31,750
need to make some refinements to our

623
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,580
approval process to make sure that those

624
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,470
processors that are using volatile

625
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:39,178
solvents are doing so in the safest

626
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:43,750
manner possible we're looking at

627
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:46,298
reforming our waste rules there's I

628
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,519
think a good bit that we can do there to

629
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:49,879
make sure not only that the waste rules

630
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:52,730
really make sense

631
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,090
for for growers and processors but also

632
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,390
that they make sense in terms of

633
00:23:55,089 --> 00:24:00,980
mitigating opportunities for diversion

634
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,250
we have identified waste as one of the

635
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,349
the key areas where items can be

636
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:10,960
misrepresented in metric and diversion

637
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:13,219
can occur we'll also be looking at

638
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,779
refining a number of things around our

639
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:19,640
compliance areas you know what what

640
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:23,269
licensees can and can't do when they're

641
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,190
under suspension for example under what

642
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:28,069
conditions would we restrict a license

643
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:32,240
rather than cancel it it's a fairly long

644
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:34,099
list and as far as the calendar goes we

645
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,859
will be putting out a public notice

646
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:39,349
which will say in much more detail what

647
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:43,549
we're considering and that public notice

648
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:46,250
will go out in November I believe which

649
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:49,909
begins a two-week public comment period

650
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,799
and it's really important that people

651
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,600
who have an interest in these rules pay

652
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,619
attention to that public comment period

653
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:59,389
you can sign up for automatic email

654
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:00,769
updates on our website and they will

655
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,130
tell you exactly when that public

656
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:06,200
comment period is but too often we go

657
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,570
through this rulemaking process that's

658
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,569
required by the law to be an inclusive

659
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:14,599
public process we finish our rules we

660
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:16,879
adopt them and then three or four weeks

661
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,889
later I hear from somebody in the

662
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,850
industry that says this rule that you

663
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:24,650
just did is nonsense it doesn't work and

664
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:26,719
it's really difficult for the agency

665
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,630
there's to receive the input and make a

666
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,860
meaningful change at that point the time

667
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:33,470
for meaningful input is in the public

668
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:35,649
comment period that's when it's going to

669
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,759
be very useful for us to hear from you

670
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,140
so I would encourage everyone who's not

671
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,319
signed up for those updates

672
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:46,130
sign up for the updates read the rules

673
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:48,470
carefully when we put out our notice to

674
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,860
devote the time you know if you have an

675
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,920
interest devote the time before the

676
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:56,269
rules are final and that's the way that

677
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,680
you'll be the most effective advocate

678
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:02,660
for your interest the old if you don't

679
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,630
vote you don't get the it's the

680
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,340
same thing

681
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,510
we got to get our voices out there

682
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:08,609
you've got to let them know what's going

683
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:11,369
on these these public comment periods

684
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,719
are so important to show up to and make

685
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,089
your voice be heard because there's

686
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,710
things that not everybody thinks of I

687
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:18,179
don't think of everything there I know

688
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,130
there's so many challenges that we're

689
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,420
facing in the industry it's really

690
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,490
important that we communicate that to

691
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,560
the agencies so they can try and fix it

692
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,029
and make it work better so please be

693
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:31,589
active please be involved in that

694
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:34,259
process so important so Amanda I'm going

695
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:36,209
to shoot one back at you on medical

696
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,440
stuff you know there's a lot of question

697
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,509
around Medical there's a lot of fear

698
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,420
about transitioning in getting people

699
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:44,190
tracked getting people in the system I

700
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,230
think there's still a lot of questions

701
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:49,080
about how a card holder can access

702
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,519
medicine in the new system and what that

703
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,230
looks like and give us a quick rundown

704
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:55,849
on kind of options that people have

705
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:58,019
coming into that space okay definitely

706
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:00,779
so I think I want to start at the retail

707
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:03,619
level at the retail level a card holder

708
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:06,990
can receive product free of charge

709
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:08,069
they're also not taxed on the product

710
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,380
that they purchased at the retail level

711
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:12,599
and then they can buy a what are called

712
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,980
medical grade products and so those are

713
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,469
products made at a higher concentration

714
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:20,309
limit or a higher potency limit than

715
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,990
recreational users so I think what we

716
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:25,049
hear a lot is you know people who used

717
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,519
to be growers who now are recreational

718
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,529
producers and they want to be able to

719
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,750
give their patients medicine are people

720
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:32,339
who used to be their patients I think a

721
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,049
really simple way for people to do that

722
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,869
would be able to work with a retailer in

723
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:38,879
their community transfer the product to

724
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:41,369
the retailer and then the retailer would

725
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,680
give the the card holders that product

726
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:46,469
for free or at a very low cost if that's

727
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,789
what they decided to do so I think it's

728
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,279
really important to highlight that that

729
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:52,460
connection can still happen without the

730
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,319
typical grower patient and relationship

731
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,110
and then also or did you want to put in

732
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,000
well I just want to interject I I know

733
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,859
and this involves retailer we talked

734
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,170
about retailers retailers we have a lot

735
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:06,779
on us this is one of the things that

736
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:09,150
that we need to decide to participate in

737
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,950
if you're a retailer and there's people

738
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,600
going around there's several groups

739
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,460
trying to get some good programs started

740
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,649
for patient access some free patient

741
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,029
medicine we've

742
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,700
we've talked to farmers that are willing

743
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,558
to donate we need retailers involved in

744
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,090
that that's where the point of access is

745
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,009
for those patients so if you're a

746
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:26,449
retailer you need to make it available

747
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:28,099
and when someone comes to you and says

748
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,680
hey we're working on a patient access

749
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:32,119
program we'd like to list your store as

750
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,640
one of the stores patients can come to

751
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,839
to get free meds we have a lot of people

752
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,880
in this state that can't afford to buy

753
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,319
meds they're living on us on a monthly

754
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,030
check they don't have the money to buy

755
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:42,889
meds I don't care how cheap it gets in

756
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,690
the store it's not in your budget when

757
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,840
you when your top priorities are food

758
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,299
and medicine and you know and keeping

759
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,889
your heat on so we need to get active we

760
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,690
need to be involved and you need to stop

761
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,759
shy here all I hear from the people that

762
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,830
are starting these programs steve marks

763
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,319
been adamantly working on trying to find

764
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:02,839
a way to to find that compassionate

765
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,849
venue and it's got to happen at the

766
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,399
retail level it's where it has to happen

767
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:09,529
so retailers if you're here we need to

768
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,179
we need to be involved I need to be

769
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:13,279
involved we need to make sure that we're

770
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,080
giving that vessel for these people to

771
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,970
be able to get their medicine it doesn't

772
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:19,369
take a little bit more storage space to

773
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,259
have just a basic product that is your

774
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:23,449
giveaway for that month or something

775
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,519
that you can donate to a cardholder we

776
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,170
have to take care of these people we

777
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,150
have our own struggles but we can't

778
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,830
forget who these people are and why

779
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,780
we've been doing this for so long and

780
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:34,009
how important that is and that's where

781
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:35,420
it's got to happen that's where they

782
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:37,400
have to be able to keep track of what's

783
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,200
happening so we can give away free

784
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,330
medicine at the stores we don't have to

785
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,650
be taxed for that we need to take

786
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:45,289
advantage of that that's a great

787
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:48,019
loophole I call it a loophole but it's a

788
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:50,089
great venue and a way to get medicine

789
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,440
out to people you know I mean that's

790
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,209
where it's at we need to get it out

791
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,650
there and they're finding a way to do it

792
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,630
but we need to step up as industry

793
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,130
people and donate those products from

794
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,080
your farms donate those products from

795
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,790
your cookie companies whatever you're

796
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,349
making you can be involved this is

797
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:05,389
something that we need to continue

798
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:07,609
throughout this process is taking care

799
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:12,280
of our sickest and most needy folks in

800
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:15,619
this state so keep it up and so

801
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:19,819
legislation passed recently allows for a

802
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:21,469
Noel CC licensed processor to apply for

803
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,639
an endorsement with olcc so it's

804
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,509
something that you would need to fill

805
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,700
out a form to

806
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:27,710
endorsement for and be approved before

807
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,930
you were to able to do it but it would

808
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,970
allow a processor to take in Flour

809
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,100
material from a patient directly and

810
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:37,400
process that and then give it back to

811
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:39,740
the patient there are limits to that but

812
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,220
that is an option you know what we don't

813
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,750
want people to be doing is you know

814
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,700
processing in their garages or doing

815
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,670
things in unsafe ways and so what this

816
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,799
does is it allows a licensed processor

817
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,660
to be able to run that material and turn

818
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:58,069
it into a product directly for a patient

819
00:30:53,660 --> 00:31:00,650
and then also producers olcc licensed

820
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:02,059
producers can apply for an endorsement

821
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,310
so it'd be the same thing filling out a

822
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:07,309
form and getting approval and they can

823
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:09,649
grow from an additional area of plants

824
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:12,799
for patients only so it's called a

825
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:15,470
medically designated canopy so really on

826
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,299
all levels of the license system there

827
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,150
is a way for patients to be able to

828
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:23,659
receive product and be able to have an

829
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:26,210
affordable medicine great thank you

830
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,680
you know I think that says it all we

831
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,240
need to start getting a little more

832
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,039
involved on that and remember these

833
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,559
people I know we're busy but we need to

834
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,230
remember them so what I want to do now

835
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,659
is give an opportunity for you to ask

836
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,279
some questions of the folks we have up

837
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,040
here there will be some time after two

838
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:44,299
one-on-one things but if we have some

839
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,399
questions in the crowd I think we're

840
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:54,680
certainly right let's hear it for the

841
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:57,259
panel one more time here we go oh by the

842
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,440
way all the questions please be brief

843
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:11,329
and no rambling that's always okay thank

844
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:14,539
you my question is for Jesse sweet and I

845
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:18,099
would just like to know well this is a

846
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:20,450
two-part question one how many

847
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:24,649
registrations you have received for the

848
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:28,819
20 pound transfer and number two when

849
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:30,830
that's going to go into effect so I'm

850
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:34,629
getting hand signals from the audience

851
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:34,629
and I believe the answer is 14

852
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,820
and I'll finish it off just because we

853
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,200
recently had a meeting on it and Jesse

854
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:44,769
wasn't able to join us because he had

855
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,528
another meeting but we will with about

856
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:49,210
between 10 and 15 applications and and

857
00:32:47,528 --> 00:32:50,679
what we're doing right now is we're

858
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,990
working with the cannabis tracking

859
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:55,000
system with metric to be able to make it

860
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,370
so that transfer will be allowable in

861
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,490
the system one of the reasons is taking

862
00:32:57,369 --> 00:33:03,099
a little bit of time is it due to grower

863
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:07,079
confidentiality we have to make sure

864
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:09,428
that we don't loosen the blocks between

865
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,648
recreational and medical too much we

866
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,899
really want to keep that on in the

867
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:14,859
forefront and so we're working on

868
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:17,619
getting that done as soon as possible

869
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:25,509
but what's your your guys's safety in

870
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:27,729
mind as well I have a question I I have

871
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:29,349
a company a seed to sale company and we

872
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,028
have four different licenses and we've

873
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:32,888
been doing this for a few years and I

874
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:34,750
find the renewal process to be really

875
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:36,548
bureaucratic and I'm wondering if you

876
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,079
guys are working on streamlining part of

877
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,879
the renewal process if you haven't had

878
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,028
any changes you know one of the

879
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,010
questions about have you ever had an

880
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:47,230
exception it's like yes three years ago

881
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:48,788
we had one so just you know if you

882
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,159
haven't had any changes are we working

883
00:33:48,788 --> 00:33:52,960
on streamlining that not only to limit

884
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,419
your bureaucracy but ours as well

885
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,610
because it's a lot of work for us so the

886
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:59,110
short answer is yes absolutely I mean

887
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:01,479
it's definitely been difficult on our

888
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:03,638
end as well one of the biggest reasons

889
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,409
why it has been a member some process

890
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:06,908
for licensees is because of the volume

891
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:08,769
of changes that have happened both

892
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:10,269
legislatively and with our rules over

893
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:12,579
the last couple of years so somebody

894
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:14,139
license really early on by the time they

895
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:16,299
get to their renewal there's been a

896
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,250
number of changes in the requirements

897
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,960
that we just need to verify that they

898
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,690
meet those those current standards

899
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,190
there's also a lot of change going on in

900
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,750
the industry and we're seeing that at

901
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,429
the renewal time that's the time that

902
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,139
people are changing their tiers or

903
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,418
adding business partners or looking to

904
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:34,210
sell their business so it has been

905
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:36,250
cumbersome both for licensees and on our

906
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,990
end as well I think we finally have

907
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,460
gotten to a space though where we have a

908
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:42,529
pretty streamlined pack

909
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,119
pretty stripped down requirements just

910
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,010
making sure that there are no changes

911
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,719
and we're looking to get to a place

912
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,550
where we could almost have an automatic

913
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,139
type of renewal so that if there isn't

914
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,990
been no changes it can be just

915
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,940
instantaneous it is yet another area

916
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:57,799
that one of the reasons why we have

917
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,869
shifted our licensing staff over to

918
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,580
focusing more on those renewals we know

919
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:02,989
a lot of businesses want to make those

920
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,630
changes and so we need to get them

921
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:07,579
processed so that was the longer version

922
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,840
of a but yes we are working on it I

923
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:10,880
think we're actually getting into a good

924
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,990
space so that hopefully people that have

925
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,090
gone through that very cumbersome

926
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:15,529
process in the last year the next time

927
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,190
they renew it's gonna be much much

928
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,600
faster and easier yes I first of all I

929
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,510
thank all of you for your hard work and

930
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,360
dedication my question is along the same

931
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,580
lines as the previous question

932
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,800
referencing director marks August 30th

933
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:33,619
the memo that stated that there are two

934
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,750
investigators assigned to work on new

935
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,659
applications my question is are there

936
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:42,079
any additional personnel or resources

937
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:45,440
being applied or hopefully in your

938
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,710
future to be applied to processing new

939
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,650
applications to reduce the now 12 to 14

940
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,500
or longer month waiting period for a new

941
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:57,200
application processing appreciate that

942
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,230
question you know we asked for as extra

943
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:02,179
resources to help out Danica's licensing

944
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,820
team during this session we got some

945
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:07,250
during the emergency board time to help

946
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,550
move forward with the applications we

947
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,139
are not going to get any more relief

948
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:15,170
from staffing in the near term our

949
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:18,619
budget is set we only have a finite

950
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,940
number of folks so and as Danica

951
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:23,089
explained we're really looking at

952
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:25,400
getting those renewals moving forward so

953
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,380
it's gonna continue to be slow for

954
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,960
licensees it's one of the reasons that

955
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,910
we communicated out there because you

956
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,860
know we know people have a ton of

957
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:36,529
investment move in Florida I want you to

958
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,690
have realistic expectations about what

959
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,300
we can do I don't know what's going to

960
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,820
happen in the legislative session next

961
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,920
year when they look at us for our next

962
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,360
two-year budget

963
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,760
what we're gonna need and how they see

964
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,090
our system as you know we've got a lot

965
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,640
of supply in the hydro reports been out

966
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:56,140
there's discussions about ways to

967
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:58,539
moderate the overall system

968
00:36:56,139 --> 00:37:00,699
we'll probably we're gonna be doing a

969
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:03,429
supply study on that and looking at that

970
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:06,189
as well we're not gonna make direct

971
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:09,989
recommendations legislature we may

972
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:13,000
provide them with ideas about how to

973
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:15,399
manage a large supply and the license

974
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,050
issue so I don't know what resources are

975
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,980
really gonna look like in the future

976
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:23,560
either so I think it's just we got to be

977
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,639
real with people about where we sit and

978
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:26,199
I don't think he can have the

979
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,359
expectation that suddenly we're gonna

980
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:33,159
bust loose and have a lot more folks to

981
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:35,769
then Licensing in the near term Mike but

982
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:37,690
relight growth systems federal

983
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:41,500
government has a long history of farm

984
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:43,869
subsidies after last season's incredible

985
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,409
market correction a lot of very

986
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:49,119
knowledgeable talent grower families

987
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:51,849
suffered all kinds of losses is there

988
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,980
any opportunity on a state level LLC sea

989
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:56,500
level that's really experienced you

990
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:59,079
several years of incredible tax revenues

991
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,940
of diverting some of that back to

992
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,480
farmers or back to people in the

993
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:06,030
industry

994
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:09,969
to support this nascent Oregon industry

995
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:12,070
so I'll take that one I think there is I

996
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:14,139
don't know where they want to apply it

997
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,910
but we've already seen you know who

998
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:18,219
legislature put some of those dollars to

999
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:20,469
work in an enforcement side right they

1000
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:22,449
provided enforcement dollars criminal

1001
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:24,549
justice Commission I think there's

1002
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:27,129
discussion about how do you maybe

1003
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,720
subsidize some number of patients and

1004
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,950
the medical system that are indigent

1005
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,599
with some of those dollars there is

1006
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:37,629
requests I hear about having like a farm

1007
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:40,210
subsidy program I don't know that that's

1008
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:43,510
going to fly but I do know it's an

1009
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:46,090
active conversation you know you are

1010
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:49,000
generating a lot of dollars sales in the

1011
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:51,730
last couple months have been continuing

1012
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,710
to go up in terms of tax receipts so I

1013
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,298
don't know how much of a and give I

1014
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,278
certainly do think that

1015
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:59,949
there's a strong interest in general

1016
00:38:57,278 --> 00:39:02,349
research medical research in general

1017
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:04,929
research around the cannabis side

1018
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:10,630
there's also this interest and how do we

1019
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:11,889
support a broader nursery system and

1020
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,599
we're going to need that I think

1021
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:15,639
eventually maybe it's happening out

1022
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,439
there but we haven't seen that nursery

1023
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:19,688
endorsement really taking place where

1024
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:22,748
you could have maybe more strains and

1025
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:25,478
because now you have to realize your new

1026
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:27,218
production inside the system we really

1027
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:28,898
do need to make sure that those plants

1028
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:31,208
are available and grown so people can

1029
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:34,179
plant their crops in the future Adam so

1030
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:35,889
the answer is there's some money there I

1031
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:37,389
think some of it will be directed

1032
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:41,379
towards the cannabis industry but I

1033
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:44,108
can't tell you where it's all about the

1034
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:46,659
dollars I can say we've watched a lot of

1035
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:48,759
them having to use liquor staff on the

1036
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:50,619
cannabis side and we really need to push

1037
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:52,539
and talk to your legislators about

1038
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:55,509
making sure that the allotment goes they

1039
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:57,609
need more money they don't always say it

1040
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:59,019
but I see it they need more money to

1041
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:00,548
make this happen we want faster

1042
00:39:59,018 --> 00:40:02,528
turnaround times we want that it takes

1043
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:04,199
staff there are limited people we've got

1044
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:06,068
a limited you know this this guy's

1045
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:07,358
deemed with taking care of all the

1046
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:09,099
packaging and labeling that's a big

1047
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,048
undertaking when you got so many product

1048
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:12,130
lines coming in so they need more money

1049
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:14,108
but they're held to what they have

1050
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,648
budget wise so they've done an amazing

1051
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:19,509
job with what I've seen them do just to

1052
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:21,219
be able in size jump right back in here

1053
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:23,380
because I do want to talk about one of

1054
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,759
our main priorities one of our

1055
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,130
efficiency points

1056
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:28,599
you know our licensing system worked

1057
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,880
well for us to get you up and running

1058
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,519
we've produced over 200 million dollars

1059
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,199
of tax revenue with that initial system

1060
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:37,238
we put in well that hasn't worked well

1061
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,838
for us for doing these renewals it's

1062
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:42,999
failing us as failing Danica's team you

1063
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:45,608
don't see that but this has really put a

1064
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:47,668
lot of pressure on licensing because we

1065
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:50,380
don't have that automation employees

1066
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:52,239
we're looking we're gonna migrate out of

1067
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,699
the system we are and they didn't do

1068
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,139
anything you're wrong they helped us get

1069
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:58,700
to where we are we're just in a new

1070
00:40:56,139 --> 00:41:00,920
product a new provider and when

1071
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:03,588
you work on the policies that help that

1072
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,480
move quicker so that you know we'll have

1073
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:08,179
some efficiencies there so on behalf of

1074
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,608
the agency we need some help with

1075
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:14,929
getting our IT requests in place and

1076
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:16,608
building that up that'll help you I have

1077
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:18,529
a quick question I'm a little different

1078
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:21,049
side than product it's more on the

1079
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,940
service side are there any plans to

1080
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,359
create a certification program similar

1081
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,710
to Washington as the medical

1082
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,719
certification program to recognize

1083
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:37,070
consultants knowledge beyond that

1084
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:38,509
tenders that kind of thing so what I

1085
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,609
think the question refers to is a

1086
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,440
program in Washington where they have

1087
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:47,049
certified consultants who are actually

1088
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:50,300
present in the retail as far as I know

1089
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:53,930
there's nobody considering this type of

1090
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,760
thing in Oregon I serve on the Oregon

1091
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:57,889
cannabis commission and there are a

1092
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,950
couple other members of that commission

1093
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:04,190
present in the audience today that

1094
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:07,068
Commission has been considering ideas

1095
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:10,550
around provider training around employee

1096
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:13,489
training which I think would be designed

1097
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:15,318
to achieve the same type of goal that

1098
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:18,368
the Washington program is shooting for

1099
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:21,980
but doing it in a slightly different way

1100
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:25,150
those are just proposals right now the

1101
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,559
the cannabis Commission needs to

1102
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:31,430
finalize its recommendations and those

1103
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,568
will be coming out later in the year all

1104
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:33,618
right thank you thank you very much

1105
00:42:32,568 --> 00:42:34,759
let's hear it again for the panel's

1106
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,530
unfortunately that's all the time we

1107
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,809
have for questions

1108
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,809
[Applause]
