1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,189
good afternoon we had planned to be on

2
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:11,199
for an hour but we have half an hour so

3
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:15,339
I would encourage all of you to read our

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,660
speakers BIOS on the app because the

5
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:18,820
wealth of knowledge and the years of

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,640
experience we have both from the crafts

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,039
perspective the regulatory perspective

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,280
but helping build industry in this new

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,230
legalized regime we are very blessed to

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,900
have these three people with us

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,200
I have beside me here Joel Podolski

12
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:37,420
Travis Lane and David Hereford all three

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,940
of them we have relied on at both grow

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,769
tech labs and at niche Canada the

15
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,988
National Institute for cannabis health

16
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:46,420
and education because one of the things

17
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:49,709
that I'm a very strong advocate for is

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,948
not only education but communications

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,088
that provides an opportunity to tie

20
00:00:52,948 --> 00:01:00,039
government industry health professional

21
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,649
associations all into the mix so people

22
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,228
actually understand how we can get to a

23
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:07,840
place in Canada we were were fully

24
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:10,569
utilizing and realizing the benefits of

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,180
legalizing cannabis what we have now

26
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:15,819
with the craft industry I think from

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,830
somebody who is an outsider and has not

28
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:19,869
only been educated by these three and

29
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:23,200
other people in industry is the

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:25,930
realization that our present government

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,629
at all three levels is viewing the craft

32
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,410
industry a with a bit of hesitation but

33
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:33,759
also in some cases as a bit of a problem

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,509
versus what they should be viewing the

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,740
craft industry as is a solution a

36
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,010
solution to the issues that we see

37
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:44,589
around quality the issues around supply

38
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,750
and the issues around economic

39
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,480
development and job creation for our

40
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,189
province and for our country I don't

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,020
want to take up too much of your time

42
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,179
I'm first going to ask each one of the

43
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:57,159
panels to take a brief 1 minute

44
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,810
introduction to talk about some of the

45
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,269
things that they see happening with the

46
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:05,650
craft industry here in BC and Canada

47
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:06,908
Joel hi i'm joel porter ski co-founder

48
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,170
the craft can of association british

49
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,539
columbia a co-founder of cascading

50
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,068
agricultural cooperative association a

51
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,989
lot of the dynamics that i see going on

52
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:15,818
in the craft industry is a regulatory

53
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,969
environment that is very stifling to the

54
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:18,619
industry a lot of

55
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:22,479
miscommunication on all three levels of

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,379
government municipal land use bylaws and

57
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:28,310
you know we've been doing our best to

58
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:29,539
try and educate and I feel like having

59
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,000
conversation getting more people

60
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:36,379
involved in the conversation telling you

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,680
know their governments as well is part

62
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:43,669
of it I'm Travis Lane

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,260
I'm organic canvas grower and I've

64
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,719
applied for licenses with Health Canada

65
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:49,669
at this point I've been growing for

66
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:53,240
fifteen to twenty years which is pretty

67
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,679
much half of my life and not always as a

68
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,540
professional sometimes in a closet

69
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,510
sometimes in the one bedroom in my

70
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:01,669
one-bedroom apartment you know and more

71
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:03,500
recently on a more industrial scale and

72
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:05,059
you know with the ability to do some

73
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,189
data accumulation and that kind of stuff

74
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,209
I mean when we talk regulations for

75
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,340
small business people that are

76
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,289
bootstrapping it obviously there have

77
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,700
been added costs and added risks that

78
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,370
come from some of the regulations that

79
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,539
have been created on a federal scale

80
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,920
really the big hurdle that we've had to

81
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,750
jump when we've been looking to apply

82
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,309
for licensing with our small facilities

83
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,870
has been regional it's about getting

84
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,120
zoning making sure that there's water

85
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,409
and power making sure that the local

86
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,569
regional district is willing to accept

87
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:30,739
you and so now we've just gotten to the

88
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,169
point where we've jumped a lot of those

89
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,489
hurdles in BC the ALR decisions that

90
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,530
have been made in the past have really

91
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,789
held up a lot as well and so I think

92
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,159
we're gonna see the first waves of

93
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:41,389
micros but I think that you know small

94
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,519
business people that are bootstrapping

95
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,589
an operation cannot afford to wait for a

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,930
long long time to be licensed and so my

97
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,659
hope is that we see a proliferation of

98
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,400
these licenses at speed coming up and

99
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,709
that Health Canada can step up and start

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,719
to to pump them out a little quick more

101
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,769
quickly they have claimed to set service

102
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,959
standards for these kinds of things

103
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,330
recently and so hopefully we see that

104
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,969
come true but I can say that you know

105
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,950
from a perspective of the the growing

106
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:09,229
culture in British Columbia it's an

107
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:11,179
economic driver it produces a lot of

108
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:14,899
money for our economy more than forestry

109
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,340
you know and it's also something that

110
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,590
the province in the regional districts

111
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,089
haven't really embraced as that economic

112
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,219
driver so that they can encourage people

113
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:24,619
to get into the space and so whether

114
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,940
it's trying to stand in the way or

115
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,530
whether it's simply they don't

116
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:30,110
understand what we're finding is that

117
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:30,669
there's a certain amount a certain lack

118
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,740
of knowledge

119
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,660
standing in our way to allow this to

120
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,620
grow quickly and and we need it we need

121
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,170
it in this province now thanks hi

122
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,850
everybody my name is David Hereford a

123
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,400
pleasure to be here and look forward to

124
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,140
your your questions very sensitive to

125
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,179
the fact that Travis and Joel are the

126
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,209
growers on the panel so it's a pleasure

127
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,030
to be here with them my history is

128
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,069
really 20 25 years in government at all

129
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:59,979
different levels I started smoking

130
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,259
cannabis when I was in grade 9 and

131
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,030
working in various crown corporations

132
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,189
and so on designing government programs

133
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:10,149
and one of the the ones I got to design

134
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:12,100
was in help design was the 99 mm working

135
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,259
for mr. Kriens administration and and

136
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,800
does help design the medical marijuana

137
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,459
program that we have today also the

138
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,110
designated grower program and so on and

139
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:24,969
the real reason that that program has

140
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,460
stood the test of time a number of core

141
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,080
challenges is because we took a very

142
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,989
proactive approach and actually

143
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,729
consulted the experts before we

144
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,370
developed those regulations so I'm very

145
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,900
grateful to growers across the country

146
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,480
at that time mostly through compassion

147
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:43,899
clubs that helped design that program

148
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,819
that certainly has been missing in this

149
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,979
current age where the program has really

150
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:49,839
been designed almost to some degree in

151
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,770
spite of small producers as opposed to

152
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:56,049
with them so I think that there's a lot

153
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:58,779
that can still be done it requires a lot

154
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,790
more communication and education I've

155
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,149
also been a political activist through

156
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,930
my career almost recently I was national

157
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:08,439
policy chair for the Liberal Party

158
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,290
Canada not involved in that role anymore

159
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,420
and was it was proud that the leadership

160
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,300
that our leader took in terms of making

161
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,040
the commitment that he made in the last

162
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,650
election but I'm also here to say I

163
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,189
think the policy is failing on a number

164
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:25,750
of different levels edibles and various

165
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:28,509
other things a communication breakdown

166
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,839
but certainly not getting small growers

167
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,689
into the system I think is number one on

168
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,459
the list in terms of problems the

169
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:38,469
government is not achieving the policy

170
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:40,930
goals they establish the black market is

171
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,960
still alive and well they have not

172
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,850
prevented the establishment of war

173
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,399
corporate two conglomerates which was

174
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,259
something that they wanted to avoid and

175
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,478
they have not developed a micro

176
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,090
licensing system that can support a

177
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,060
small business so far only six I think

178
00:06:54,089 --> 00:07:00,179
of determined have made it through the

179
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,939
process and only a 200 or 300 or so have

180
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,310
even tried to make the attempt when we

181
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,439
have twenty five thousand growers across

182
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,060
the country that are approved in the

183
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,879
medical system so look forward to your

184
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,870
questions and discussions about

185
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,389
solutions and to what some of those

186
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,978
challenges could be so thank you we'll

187
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,750
go to the floor for the next question

188
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,209
but I just wanted to have a the

189
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,680
panelists comment on we recognized some

190
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:26,038
of the challenges and the barriers that

191
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,360
have been created for craft growers I'm

192
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,060
sure many of you in the room are

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,310
familiar with micro cultivation

194
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,158
regulations and the processes and the

195
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,970
type of resources that it takes to get

196
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:41,370
into the regulated regime but I wanted

197
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,759
to talk with each panelist about giving

198
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,918
me your number one priority where we in

199
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,500
this room collectively and with the

200
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,709
opportunity we have before us for change

201
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,158
not only are we in the midst of a

202
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:58,529
federal election where votes count and

203
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,718
we're strong in numbers cannabis

204
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,399
industry definitely not only people who

205
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:04,319
are engaged in industry but people who

206
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,598
are other recreational medicinal users

207
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,339
but also here in the province of BC we

208
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,430
have UBC M coming up at the end of the

209
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,560
month where all of the municipal staff

210
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,379
elected officials and provincial leaders

211
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,449
gather to talk policy we at neish has a

212
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:21,418
non-profit for three years in a row and

213
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,250
partnership with Akers and others have

214
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,439
tried to present a workshop and have

215
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,389
been rejected because I really believe

216
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,699
that the myth and stereotypes are still

217
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,430
very strong article in The Globe and

218
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,019
Mail last week about how the federal

219
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,059
leaders don't even want to talk about

220
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,519
the cannabis file including the prime

221
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,458
minister who put legalization in the

222
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,110
forefront in the last campaign so for

223
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,699
each panelist if you could quickly give

224
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,000
me one thing that you think could

225
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,829
pivotally pivotally we move this dial if

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,448
we all collectively organized and

227
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:53,549
reached out and wrote letters and

228
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,599
knocked on doors to get our message out

229
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,959
there Joe

230
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,050
as real

231
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,139
hard to pick just one god we have 30

232
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:06,009
minutes buddy that wasn't my choice okay

233
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:08,049
so I would say from an administrative

234
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:11,139
standpoint the build first policy is

235
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:13,899
probably the biggest one I'd say that

236
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:17,730
policy alone without any other policy on

237
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:20,230
the board is enough to kill the industry

238
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,420
the requirement to build a hundred

239
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,250
percent of your infrastructure to Health

240
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:28,449
Canada's requirements which is a moving

241
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,070
target is really precludes a lot of

242
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,379
participation you can't walk into a room

243
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,050
with potential investors with nothing

244
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:37,389
more than an idea and expect to get any

245
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:38,709
kind of positive results and I find it

246
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:40,269
really hard to believe that the smart

247
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:44,050
people at Health Canada aren't aware of

248
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:47,139
that so for me that that would be the

249
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:48,519
number one and you know the

250
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,419
life-threatening disease then we can

251
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,889
deal with the quality of

252
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:55,929
life-threatening diseases afterwards

253
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:57,759
yeah I mean I think a focus on trying to

254
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,099
educate everyone from policymakers to

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,809
the public so when we when we look at

256
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,360
like if the government doesn't listen

257
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:06,789
then get the public to act right so like

258
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,919
I teach a course at commotions College

259
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,689
on Vancouver Island about just basic the

260
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,919
fundamentals of running a cannabis

261
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,870
business and how it's different than

262
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,429
running another business and the thing

263
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,200
is everything's amplified they've

264
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:19,719
amplified the risk they've amplified the

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,000
cost but the rest of it is still very

266
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,940
much just running a business and so if

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,830
we can show the both the economic

268
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,230
positive side of it and the fact that

269
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,790
the sky isn't falling and we can do this

270
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,139
to policymakers and we can do this to

271
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,539
staff and we can do it like I think

272
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:36,730
that's an opportunity we have now in the

273
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:39,549
early stages of legalization that we

274
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,750
have to focus on D stigmatizing what

275
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:43,169
we're doing and we do that through

276
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,309
somewhat traditional means by using

277
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:46,719
education and Lobby and all of these

278
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,759
things that already exist for other

279
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,170
industries yeah it's a little harder

280
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,600
because the stigma is there but it

281
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:55,089
always has been you know it used to be

282
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,230
that we just openly broke the law and so

283
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:00,610
now that's changing a little bit and

284
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,019
what we need to do is we need to show

285
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,200
people that this isn't something to be

286
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:07,059
afraid of that this isn't we accept much

287
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,700
higher risk activities in society

288
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,989
without batting an eye then and

289
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,330
thing that could possibly be associated

290
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,519
with cannabis and cannabis provides a

291
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,170
tremendous economic benefit and quite

292
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,779
likely health and wellness benefits as

293
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,129
well and so I think it's gonna take time

294
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,959
but it is about pounding that

295
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:24,779
educational gavel over and over and like

296
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,970
trying to talk to policymakers most of

297
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,319
them politicians are still human most of

298
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,670
them are listen to you right like most

299
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,590
of them if you approach them nicely

300
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:33,000
they'll still listen and it's not easy

301
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,899
and it's not going to move quickly and

302
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,340
there's not going to be a lot of quick

303
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,850
changes but we just have we have to do

304
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,590
it it's the only way to go forward yeah

305
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,629
I'd agree with what Travis said around

306
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,970
education I would I guess if I was

307
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:47,549
thinking of one thing to crack growers

308
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:52,139
is do everything you can to maintain

309
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:53,419
your independence really do everything

310
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,220
you can to maintain your independence

311
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:58,829
organized into collectives that have

312
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,370
your your interests at heart you know

313
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,110
we've been working on a BC a chronic

314
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,190
cannabis co-op over the last number of

315
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,810
months and we're getting close to

316
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,390
finishing that off and getting that

317
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:12,389
going but I think it has been empowering

318
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:14,429
to have people together who are in

319
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:16,199
common cause it is a David versus

320
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,609
Goliath struggle I think that the sector

321
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,460
is in right now and you really need to

322
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,340
organize into collectives to maximize

323
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,610
your political clout your purchasing

324
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,889
power and your marketing a clout as well

325
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,870
in terms of making sure when that day

326
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:32,699
comes that magical day in the future

327
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,070
when we have thousands of crop growers

328
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,930
being able to just continue doing what

329
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,150
they're doing today that you get a

330
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:40,439
premium price for your product and I

331
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,539
think that that's going to be the most

332
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,910
important thing for craft growers

333
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:47,209
maintain your independence organized

334
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:50,549
into collectives and then fight and

335
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:53,519
advocate for your interests you cannot

336
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,740
underestimate the institutional biases

337
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,289
that are against you the public health

338
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,659
system the police the department of

339
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:02,129
justice and of course now we have large

340
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,289
corporate conglomerates that are

341
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,570
interested in making sure that craft

342
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:08,939
growers don't get independent craft

343
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,680
growers don't get a piece of that market

344
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,770
so I think that would be my number one

345
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,719
thing to focus on I'd like to open up

346
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,939
the floor to questions as I said we have

347
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,850
a wealth of knowledge and expertise here

348
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,540
at the table both from a craft growing

349
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,320
perspective a regulatory

350
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:27,730
effective so I can take over the mic for

351
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,350
a long time but it's alright I'm

352
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,820
bringing the microphone over to them

353
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,800
right now let's see where to get it for

354
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,600
the panel right quick and it abbreviated

355
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:40,899
form I like that you guys are brief and

356
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,850
succinct thank you Robert korchek from

357
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:43,419
allergy consulting thank you guys for

358
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,360
being here today

359
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:48,729
awesome information so far I'm recently

360
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,550
just established myself as Aboriginal

361
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,200
descent recently received that so I'm

362
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:56,169
wondering what do you guys know about

363
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,450
the economic aspects of access to market

364
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,309
for Aboriginal kind of companies and

365
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,050
that aspect of it especially kind of

366
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:03,399
more interested as well from David's

367
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:06,519
opinion being there from the Liberal

368
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,470
Party well I can't speak for the Liberal

369
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,809
Party you know what I try but on the

370
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,490
indigenous side I think again I see a

371
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,769
lot of similarities frankly as we've

372
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,320
been traveling around the province

373
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:19,629
between craft growers and indigenous

374
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,340
communities they feel left out for a

375
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:24,159
number of different reasons but I think

376
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,810
they also have tremendous clout we've

377
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,610
seen some examples of that in British

378
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:31,269
Columbia and around the retail piece of

379
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,519
anchor Isle and in the couch and area so

380
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:36,759
and I think that also crop growers

381
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,350
indigenous communities see the plant in

382
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,970
a different way I think there's

383
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,060
certainly a lot of wellness pieces

384
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,410
there's a lot of you know spirituality

385
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:47,049
in terms of the place that it's grown

386
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:49,480
and so on and I think also First Nations

387
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,339
indigenous communities also have an

388
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,570
advantage around land use I think

389
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,580
there's plenty of partnership

390
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,650
opportunities I'd love to see craft

391
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,770
growers working more with indigenous

392
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:02,079
communities in BC the job creation

393
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,049
opportunities are significant I think

394
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,720
that the the mindset is very similar

395
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:09,129
it's a rural economic development

396
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,379
initiative like really nothing we've

397
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,210
seen in our generation you know we

398
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:17,110
talked about even just getting 900

399
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:19,389
growers in BC at 2100 square feet two

400
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,960
and a half full-time employees per eye

401
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:25,090
grow up that's 3300 jobs

402
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,290
direct jobs in rural communities across

403
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:31,540
BC in a year or two if we can get 900

404
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,860
growers and that's a small number and we

405
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,539
should really be making sure that

406
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,730
indigenous

407
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:38,159
growers are in that mix and as we engage

408
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,500
municipal governments we should be

409
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,809
thinking of indigenous communities as

410
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,730
governments themselves and there's

411
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,739
tremendous opportunities I think there

412
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,899
as well and we also see some movement at

413
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,250
the national level around taxation and

414
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,299
so on and so forth so I think it's

415
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:56,778
something to watch and I'm hopeful did

416
00:15:54,299 --> 00:16:01,019
you want to add anything Travis to Joel

417
00:15:56,778 --> 00:16:02,789
yeah again I can idle awesome actually

418
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,379
but a number of colleagues of mine that

419
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:07,409
are dealing with a number of nations

420
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,639
around the country their feedback has

421
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:11,370
been of course the government set up

422
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:15,360
this separate wing to deal exclusively

423
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:17,970
with indigenous applications and what

424
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,278
I've heard is that it's not going quite

425
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,420
as smoothly as anticipated and that

426
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,919
perhaps there's been a little bit of

427
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,769
misleading on the part of the government

428
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,479
of how how much they were gonna help

429
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,948
indigenous community steward and there's

430
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,370
been a lot of missing for a lot of

431
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:36,838
misunderstanding between band councils

432
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:39,720
and especially elders where band

433
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:42,420
councils are really focusing on the

434
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,300
development of expensive massive

435
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:48,328
infrastructure for production and I've

436
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,370
talked to band councils members and

437
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:54,239
elders from Manitoba from here and

438
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,810
elsewhere and the messages that I try to

439
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,220
keep giving them is retail is your best

440
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,429
foot in the door in the marketplace

441
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,558
because it doesn't require the capital

442
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:06,990
input immediately you have shops you

443
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,779
know already you just need to passband

444
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,970
councils to zone to allow cannabis sales

445
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,318
for medical purposes and so it can

446
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,850
generate revenue very quickly for the

447
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,889
band it can generate a few jobs and you

448
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,230
can develop relationships with craft

449
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:23,759
growers around the area because you can

450
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:26,699
simply assert your independence from the

451
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,048
government and but again the message

452
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,308
here is going to be unity because I've

453
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,900
also talked to bands talking about

454
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,190
competing with other bands making sure

455
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,019
the other pen doesn't get the market

456
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,090
first all this stuff and I feel like

457
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,470
unity is really really the key here and

458
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:41,579
really engaging the elders more on the

459
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,140
spiritual side of things to actually

460
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:44,389
kind of bring the energy more into

461
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,680
alignment

462
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,710
kind of can heal a little bit of the

463
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,289
schisms that I'm seeing creating some of

464
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,130
these political dynamics within the band

465
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:58,759
themselves any other questions from the

466
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:01,730
audience I have a question say someone

467
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,319
has been an underground you know craft

468
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,490
girl for a while and they won they don't

469
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,710
have a million dollars but they want to

470
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:11,269
get into it what can they do well I mean

471
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:15,019
it's kind of like starting a brewery a

472
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:17,119
lot of our craft brewing groups that

473
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:18,289
turned into businesses started doing it

474
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,939
in their closets and doing it in their

475
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,109
garages which is exactly where most of

476
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,370
us started growing it does like you have

477
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,079
to take the mentality of essentially

478
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,279
starting over you have to take the

479
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,889
mentality that you're gonna find

480
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,480
potentially a new location that you're

481
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,950
gonna raise the money to make your build

482
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,299
happen that you might have to take on

483
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,160
partners to do it right now

484
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:38,809
you can bootstrap something small like

485
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,430
it doesn't have to be a million and a

486
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:43,549
half dollars but you're not gonna get a

487
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:46,160
full canopy and a processor for you know

488
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:47,450
very cheap and so if you want to start

489
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,100
bootstrapping it and Health Canada's

490
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,840
made clear they accept this you can

491
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,579
start by building one small grow room in

492
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,929
one small dry room and taking a video of

493
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:55,939
those two rooms and applying for a

494
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,740
license from those two and they if you

495
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,730
get your license then it's a lot more

496
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,109
likely you're gonna be able to raise

497
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,210
money or borrow money in order to

498
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,500
complete the project

499
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,990
that's a good advice I would also add

500
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,509
you know consider a medical license as

501
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,490
well and it all starts to me you got to

502
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:12,200
go talk to your local municipality at

503
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,690
some point you gotta you know start that

504
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,580
discussion a regional district whatever

505
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,769
the case may be indigenous government

506
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:20,389
you need to go and start talking to them

507
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:22,250
because they're gonna be key to your

508
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,320
process no matter what yeah and like a

509
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,640
just to add to that a little bit is like

510
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,230
one of the biggest things that has

511
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,550
happened in consulting with people that

512
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,890
want to do that convert from a small

513
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,659
home grow to do it for a living is that

514
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,310
they need an architect they need to get

515
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,320
zoning they need to hire an electrical

516
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:39,289
like mechanical engineer they need to

517
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,119
like all its its assembling it from the

518
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,529
ground up is hard when everything has to

519
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,569
be the code and it's not what we've done

520
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,220
in the past and so it's like we build

521
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:48,349
the code but we don't invite everybody

522
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,240
in and they in the past and so you've

523
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:51,589
got to do that you get it's different

524
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,839
but you got to do it so make sure that

525
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:55,558
you get good construction people and

526
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:59,908
good trades people to work with that's

527
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:04,528
very important so my question is my

528
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:08,309
question is well my question is how many

529
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:10,409
actual micro grow licenses have been

530
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:13,558
given out in the province of British

531
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:17,278
Columbia or Canada period six across

532
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:19,678
Canada and how long has this I recall

533
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:21,869
like almost a year and a half ago when

534
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:26,399
Health Canada came out with a chart that

535
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:26,699
specified micro grow LPS and the hockey

536
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,498
rink

537
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,038
yeah the hockey rink is that is that

538
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:34,499
exactly when they started opening up to

539
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,269
this idea or because I'm a little

540
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,970
confused on that it seems to me a year

541
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:41,669
and a half so October 17th we were able

542
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,069
to apply for micro licensing but of

543
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:45,389
course that was you had to have a

544
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:47,038
certain amount of work done at that

545
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:50,609
point so not many people were able to

546
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,499
apply on October 17 2018 those that did

547
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:54,689
I think like there's a couple of them

548
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:56,700
eight month nine month turnaround times

549
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,159
for licensing from application to

550
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,450
receiving it but that was under the old

551
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,278
rules where you didn't have to build

552
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,778
before you submitted so now you've got

553
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:05,819
to have your bill done and you've got to

554
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:08,519
do your video evidence package before

555
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:09,749
you can submit your license and so if

556
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,190
we're waiting nine months from there

557
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:13,230
that means the build which used to be

558
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,278
part of your licensing wait now has to

559
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,778
be done ahead of time and so that

560
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:17,099
changes the timelines I think part of

561
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:20,069
the reason we haven't seen more licenses

562
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,748
issued is because there was no

563
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:23,428
understanding on a regional level of how

564
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:26,159
this was going to be zoned and so if I

565
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,210
go out as a business man and I'm told I

566
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,860
don't have a guarantee that they're

567
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,028
gonna zone my space and I don't have a

568
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,498
guarantee Health Canada's give me a

569
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,819
gonna give me a license what am I gonna

570
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,679
spend a whole bunch of money with all

571
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,960
that uncertainty and so we've seen a

572
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,429
significant delay and some fear involved

573
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,048
in people not wanting to make that

574
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,548
capital outlay at the start without

575
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:44,940
knowing they're gonna see returns for

576
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:47,819
sure right so hypothetically speaking if

577
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,970
you had a personal production license

578
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:53,759
you already got inspections done for

579
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,319
that license and you've been granted the

580
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,440
permission to grow a certain amount of

581
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:02,450
plants you could technically take that

582
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,899
and then use that as your platform to

583
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:08,610
procure a micro license is that correct

584
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:10,349
to a point yeah so I

585
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:11,699
Health Canada's also sort of changed

586
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:13,169
their tone on this they wouldn't they

587
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,130
didn't used to answer this question but

588
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,798
now they've made it pretty clear that

589
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,630
they want those old licenses to convert

590
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,879
over so if you build a compliant

591
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,900
facility around your Mme our space you

592
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,700
can even send your video evidence

593
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
package in with plants growing and

594
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,210
transfer those plants to your legal

595
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,769
license the problem is that a lot of the

596
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,960
compliance features that are required

597
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:33,929
from Health Canada inspectors and stuff

598
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,210
might not be how we did it in the old

599
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:37,440
days and so in order to retrofit around

600
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,029
your plants you're gonna have to

601
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,740
probably shut down for a little while

602
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,359
and it really comes down to a question

603
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,980
of cost if you're not building from

604
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,899
scratch and you've done a good job

605
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,240
building your facilities so it's like

606
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,830
waterproof walls like they want and all

607
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,870
of the electricals in behind the

608
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:53,369
paneling like they want and you can

609
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:55,739
perform a lot of these sanitation

610
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:58,199
protocols then you might be able to get

611
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,150
in for you know not such a big sum of

612
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,830
money and Health Canada now accepts that

613
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,870
it used to be a thing where they didn't

614
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:06,659
but they make it very clear that you

615
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:08,668
can't keep your MMAR or AC MPR ppl

616
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,070
license on the property that you're also

617
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:12,570
growing commercially without jumping

618
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:14,069
through more hoops than it would ever be

619
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:16,619
worth so you probably want to either

620
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:23,548
cancel or move your ppl once you get a

621
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:25,589
commercial license so if you go on to

622
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:27,000
the Health Canada website with all their

623
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:27,599
guidance documents you can find some of

624
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,130
the basics

625
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,829
there's the license application guide

626
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,350
there's the GP P guide the GP P guides

627
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:35,609
are most important for cultivators

628
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:37,139
you're gonna have to infer some things

629
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:38,939
they're not gonna tell you exactly what

630
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,410
to do but they're going to explain that

631
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,330
you have to have non-porous walls well

632
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,100
that means you've got to put up rfp or

633
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:46,259
PVC or some sort of paint that's

634
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:48,209
waterproof they're gonna explain some of

635
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,619
those operational things and then you

636
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,750
essentially have to extrapolate from

637
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:52,829
that and build they're not gonna tell

638
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,419
you if it's right or wrong until they

639
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:56,279
inspect you and they don't inspect you a

640
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,370
pre-license anymore they expect you

641
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,379
after the license so you know really

642
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,609
what it is is in my experience is

643
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,780
looking to other people that have been

644
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,209
approved and how they've done it and

645
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,460
then taking those practices and putting

646
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,169
it into play and and so you know you

647
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,370
just have a conversation with those of

648
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:12,809
us that have been around and we can

649
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,519
point in some of the right directions

650
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:16,678
but it's the government man nothing's

651
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:20,940
ever certain we don't know

652
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,769
yeah hey guys you mentioned reaching out

653
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,019
to regulators on all levels of

654
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:27,378
government is there a more effective

655
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:30,179
message to be bringing forward to them

656
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:32,069
I've done some reach out to myself I try

657
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,869
to stay away from the you know please

658
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:36,808
let us get into your municipality or

659
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:41,339
whatnot so just curious a few words on

660
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:43,200
that well I've been elected to political

661
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:45,269
office at the municipal level for two

662
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,690
terms I've been on the board of the

663
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:50,730
Fraser Health Authority I've been

664
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:54,570
political aid and activist by nature my

665
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,460
entire life not only raising your voice

666
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,980
raising your voice as a part of a

667
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,350
collective you know as the CEO of Gro

668
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,149
techlabs we're now taking previa lies

669
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:05,490
ation companies and supporting them to

670
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:07,288
get into the regulated market you know

671
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,538
so when I hear people say they're

672
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:11,730
hesitant to reach out to their municipal

673
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:14,069
provincial or federal elected people I

674
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,319
really believe that the only people

675
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:19,740
we're doing a disservice to is to our

676
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,138
cause and to ourselves I think having a

677
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,839
voice reaching out educating the

678
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:28,308
panelist identified three areas you know

679
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:31,138
education the economics of building out

680
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:32,368
and looking at the regulations as a

681
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,959
problem the only way we're going to

682
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:36,449
change that is a collective voice but

683
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,548
David can you touch a little bit on some

684
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,350
of the things that you learned as you

685
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:41,999
were traveling across the province with

686
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:45,148
the coop and some of the things that we

687
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:47,700
could do collectively yeah no thanks for

688
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:49,378
the question I think it really is again

689
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,879
organizing and collectives one of the

690
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:52,469
things that I talked earlier is about

691
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:54,898
the benefits of that is you really pull

692
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,179
your political clout and you organize

693
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:58,768
yourself in a transparent fashion and

694
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,830
you come up with policies and proposals

695
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:03,298
because certainly my experience at

696
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:05,038
Health Canada when we were bringing in

697
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:08,700
the medical rules the bureaucrats don't

698
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,470
have a clue on how cannabis works how

699
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,499
it's grown and so on so you really do

700
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,879
have to gift-wrap them the solutions and

701
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:16,798
you can you get those solutions from

702
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:19,199
going out and talking and talking to

703
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,759
people so I think that advocacy piece is

704
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,410
critical if you look at the history of

705
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,720
progress on Canada

706
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,120
in the country it's not coming from

707
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,589
officials it's coming from politicians

708
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:33,419
who are ready to take a risk or courts

709
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,549
who are going to force the politicians

710
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,740
to do the right thing thanks to the good

711
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:39,930
work of wonderful lawyers like John

712
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,849
Conroy and others who are here those are

713
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,250
really the only two ways we've ever got

714
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:47,099
progress on cannabis in Canada political

715
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,279
leadership or courts officials

716
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:51,959
well-meaning God loved them we can't

717
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,450
rely on them to make the changes so you

718
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,829
really need political action and then

719
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,809
you need to come up with some realistic

720
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:59,250
solutions that can work certainly

721
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,679
through our co-op process we've

722
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,420
published a number of recommendations

723
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,769
that we think easy things the government

724
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,920
can do the federal government could do

725
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:09,720
in an afternoon to make the system at

726
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,539
least a little bit more attractive to

727
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,400
growers and investors and certainly

728
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,629
we've got some positive feedback from

729
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,610
that and I think through our efforts

730
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,740
we're starting to see some improvements

731
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:22,589
in the system people are being processed

732
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,599
a bit more we're raising this issue with

733
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:25,740
elected officials certainly we published

734
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,539
a jobs report

735
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,700
I think the job numbers are something

736
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:33,240
that speak very loudly especially to

737
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,890
local officials who need a tax base and

738
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,930
when you can publish some numbers that

739
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,520
we did that shows about 3,000 direct

740
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,200
jobs in rural communities in the

741
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:48,930
province that has a lot of impact as

742
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:52,769
well I think that as a Canadian citizen

743
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:55,549
my measure of success and the production

744
00:27:52,769 --> 00:28:00,480
of cannabis is having a safe product and

745
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:02,309
I am struggling to understand why as

746
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,370
crop producers we have reducing number

747
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:07,559
one a crop a quality product but number

748
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:09,239
two why is the government insisting that

749
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:12,149
we take on all this expensive

750
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,859
infrastructure an additional cost when

751
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,440
we all agree that safety testing should

752
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:18,269
be the measure really of of how of

753
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,580
whether there's a product out there that

754
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:21,869
is safe why then do they make us build

755
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,699
all this stuff and go to all this

756
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:25,799
additional expense what is the

757
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,720
justification for that I honestly I'm

758
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,970
struggling to understand that because I

759
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,920
do not see a purpose for it if we have a

760
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,779
good product and it passes all the tests

761
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,850
what is the issue why do I have to take

762
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:45,309
million dollar loan why is any of that

763
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:46,839
necessary yeah that's that's really one

764
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,339
of the big issues and to me what it

765
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:52,089
speaks to is the politicization of the

766
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:54,129
process we clearly have a double

767
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:56,139
standard of enforcement we have

768
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:59,080
regulations that have double standards

769
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,340
built into them to begin with and to me

770
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,720
that speaks directly to the

771
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,309
politicization of the process without

772
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,970
going deeper because we really could if

773
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:10,659
we wanted to yeah I mean my one-word

774
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,509
answer would be stigma I don't think

775
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,910
that the government understands what we

776
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:17,170
do this would be an agricultural pursuit

777
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,080
this would be something regulated under

778
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:23,380
egri instead the regulating it closer to

779
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,419
Pharma and so part of it is that they

780
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,880
focus so much on the processes which is

781
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,320
quality assurance and that they've put

782
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,910
these certain standards in there that

783
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:33,490
would be considered pharmaceutical grade

784
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,800
standards or you know you know we

785
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:39,250
probably treat plutonium with less care

786
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,409
than we treat our cannabis right now no

787
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,960
it's not right and as a cultivator like

788
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,850
do I think that that's a good idea no I

789
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,069
don't I mean I also think their testing

790
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:50,079
regime has this total yeast and mold

791
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:52,389
bacterial accounts that are useless

792
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,149
tests and have been shown over and over

793
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,590
and and so like what do we do we submit

794
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,820
papers to the government saying this is

795
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:59,740
wrong here's how they're doing in Alaska

796
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:01,809
here's what qPCR is here are these

797
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,160
things but right now we're in a mode

798
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:05,049
where this is brand-new and it's gonna

799
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,570
take us time and so my choice is a

800
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:10,480
grower is either state black market or

801
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:11,679
build a conforming facility and step

802
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
into the white market and like I've

803
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,340
chosen the latter but I would never tell

804
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,349
anybody to make that decision that's my

805
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:18,609
personal decision if people want to keep

806
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:21,429
operating in the black market I

807
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:23,469
encourage them to do so yeah and I would

808
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,730
add to the in addition to Travis's two

809
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,559
points I would add a third which is

810
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,240
advocate and change the rules and

811
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,279
congratulations to you Ellie in your

812
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,609
group and the companies for your

813
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,619
advocacy as well I think that again we

814
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:37,299
can't you know if you were designing a

815
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:40,299
program to fail this is what you would

816
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:41,859
design and I think that to the point

817
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,629
earlier about the question about six

818
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:45,298
like let's just stop for a second and

819
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:49,649
think of the number six

820
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:52,288
and just how pathetic that is six right

821
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:53,939
there's 25,000 across the country

822
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:55,319
growing under the medical program and I

823
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,659
know when we were bringing the medical

824
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,089
program in we had pressure around

825
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,460
infrastructure and we got to go inspect

826
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:04,138
and we got to go test and we got to tell

827
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,788
the cops where they're at we got to tell

828
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:08,609
the municipalities where they're at and

829
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:11,368
we said no way because no one's gonna

830
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:13,859
participate in the program and we were

831
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:16,378
able to do that and we've now had you

832
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:19,048
know was that two thousand 18 years of

833
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:23,128
medical growers producing cannabis for

834
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:25,679
people no one's died people keep

835
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:28,408
renewing their prescriptions doctors

836
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,710
continue to examine people and say Ellie

837
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:34,080
it's working for you keep on going so we

838
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,759
do we can't accept the premise of the

839
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,509
current regulations the way they're

840
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,669
presented it is a false choice it is the

841
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:43,558
way it is and I agree that people have

842
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,169
limited choices right now but we have to

843
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:48,480
fight to change it you can change it if

844
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:50,730
we collectively pool our political clout

845
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,919
and demand the changes because craft

846
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:55,798
producers have the product everybody

847
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,340
wants it's why people are not going into

848
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:01,138
the stores now our products not there

849
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:03,388
right the government's are feeling it

850
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:05,849
they're not making the money so just

851
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:08,308
keep on pushing organize yourself

852
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:09,928
maintain your independence and just keep

853
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:12,960
on fighting the way you've always been

854
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:14,060
fighting all these years thank you thank

855
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,019

856
