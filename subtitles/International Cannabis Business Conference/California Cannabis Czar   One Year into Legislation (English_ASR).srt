to download their app and look into

advertising if you're a dispensary owner

16
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,859
so what we have today here is the most

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,050
powerful regulator in California

18
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,670
cannabis California is the biggest

19
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,799
market and the most influential market

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,530
here in the world and the future is

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,808
happening here first you know again and

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,280
we're gonna explore that future but

23
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:48,839
before I did that I wanted to put a

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,000
quick foundation under what we're going

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,590
to talk about you know I love being on

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,170
the journalism beat I've been on it for

27
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,199
nine years and because it's so full of

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,550
these teachable moments in civics and I

29
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,909
thought I hated civics in seventh grade

30
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,829
shout-out to mr. bender but I it ended

31
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,840
up being a passion so just to run

32
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,780
through real quick we had proposition

33
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,780
215 in 1996 that created up patient

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,859
defense for marijuana not a right that's

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,368
right shout-out to prop 215 1996 whoo uh

36
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:22,799
yeah we had SB 420 that followed that

37
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:24,540
expanded the personal defense for

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
medical marijuana to a collective

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,180
defense again it was not a right

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,280
in 2015 we deregulated medical cannabis

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,689
with the macaw RZA or the Mac Kusa you

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,079
can figure out how you want to say that

43
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,519
but then in 2016 we had proposition 64

44
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,158
and this is where the rights kicked in

45
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,349
we all have personal rights to cultivate

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,469
cannabis and you can applause for that

47
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:48,449
yeah we have personal rights to possess

48
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,700
it we have personal rights to share it

49
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,189
with other adults 21 and over and now we

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,320
have commercial licensing and taxes and

51
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:58,199
regulations which were TBD when we

52
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,758
passed this in 2016 you know set up you

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,909
know with some guardrails like local

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,920
control in taxes and that kicked off

55
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,540
tens of thousands of hours of public

56
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,429
comment I can't I don't know if you guys

57
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,159
were tracking it but it must have been

58
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,229
interminable and the state you know

59
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,919
throughout a hundred million dollars to

60
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,889
form the Bureau

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,500
of cannabis control Governor Jerry Brown

62
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,929
tapped miss Laurie Ajax here who's you

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,360
know known as a no-nonsense no drama

64
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,730
you know technocrat from the Department

65
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,260
of Alcoholic Beverage Control and she's

66
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,419
been a real steady hand at the wheel of

67
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,789
a very turbulent plane that's being

68
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,708
built as it flies here in California and

69
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,489
when you look at how far we've come it's

70
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,739
quite remarkable

71
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,560
we had commercial sales begin January

72
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,259
1st in 2018 and they began under

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,090
temporary rules this January 2019 we've

74
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,439
had final rules come out and we're

75
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,969
starting to take stock of that last

76
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,250
first commercial year we have about six

77
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:52,019
hundred stores open in California we did

78
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,209
several hundred million dollars in tax

79
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,039
revenue last year and we're on our way

80
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,640
to a billion dollars in annual tax

81
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,798
revenue under a full license system you

82
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,389
know but the thing about the BCC of the

83
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,090
Bureau cannabis control is they

84
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:09,268
implement prop 64 subject to other laws

85
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,860
they can't fight local control when it

86
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,780
comes to the farms that's under a

87
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,819
different agency called the California

88
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,250
Department of Food and Agriculture when

89
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,689
it comes to testing or kitchens that's

90
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,310
under a different Department as well the

91
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,769
California Department of Public Health

92
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,759
we spread power around in America we

93
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,730
don't let it

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,159
accrete in one place but the BCC does

95
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,959
control control stores delivery

96
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,639
distributions and other points of view

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,829
and we're going to talk about the future

98
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,479
of those things with Miss Ajax and mr.

99
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:43,049
Tovar so please give him another warm

100
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:48,509
round of applause good morning thank you

101
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:50,010
for being here so we have some a new

102
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,379
milestone kicking in and I'm seeing it

103
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:54,328
on Instagram these days and that's

104
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,150
people taking photos of their first

105
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,420
annual licenses and this is a big deal

106
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,129
because you've never been able to get a

107
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,530
license from the state of California to

108
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,599
affirmatively like grow or distribute or

109
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,729
do anything with cannabis until prop 64

110
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,590
but those temporary licenses were much

111
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,209
easier to get than these annual licenses

112
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,530
but now annuals are being issued and

113
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,060
it's the year of annuals

114
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,009
I wanted to start there and talk a

115
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,870
little bit about the number of annuals

116
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:22,079
that have been issued and some of the

117
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,728
biggest challenges to getting an annual

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,250
and then how business people in this

119
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,300
audience might be able to prepare so

120
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,689
they have a smoother

121
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,610
variance in annual licensing this year

122
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:34,259
so we haven't issued very many annuals

123
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,870
there's probably you know the bureau I

124
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,990
think we're around 21 but a lot of that

125
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,810
is because we have really primarily

126
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,490
focused especially during November in

127
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,470
December I'm making sure we got people

128
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,478
their temporary licenses because that

129
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,270
ability for us to issue temporary

130
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,930
license went away at the end of of last

131
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,198
year

132
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,300
so some good news on that is that in

133
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,759
November and December we were getting so

134
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,810
many applications in December alone we

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,879
issued over 1,400 temporary licenses so

136
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,069
I think that should be something we all

137
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,710
should be thinking about because that

138
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,810
was a big rise in temporary licenses so

139
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,430
now that people have their temporary and

140
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,439
they have their extension so they can

141
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,060
operate so that's the that's probably

142
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,098
most important we want people out there

143
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,649
we want them operating now we move into

144
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:24,839
looking at the annual application and it

145
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,269
and it is challenging it's it's it's a

146
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,888
lot of rules a lot of a lot of things

147
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:30,568
that you have to provide to the Bureau

148
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,360
or the or whether it's the bureau food

149
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:35,819
nag or Public Health but we're working

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,919
on trying to figure out what's the most

151
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,509
challenging things for our applicants

152
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,758
and how we can make it easier for them

153
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:44,098
to comply with our rules and get the

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,538
documents that we need but we also have

155
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:46,139
the provisional so don't forget about

156
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:48,329
that

157
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,218
the annual event the provisional we have

158
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,318
some there was some legislation last

159
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:55,218
year that was passed and we can issue

160
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,060
Provisionals especially in situations

161
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:59,728
where you're waiting for the local

162
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,740
jurisdiction to make a decision on the

163
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:03,839
your sequel requirement that's our

164
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,788
environmental requirements or if there's

165
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,679
some some other thing that's out of

166
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:09,598
control of the applicant that they're

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,610
waiting for at the local level we can

168
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:14,370
issue a provisional and so I think

169
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,090
you're gonna see a lot of those starting

170
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,680
to this next year because there'll be a

171
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,138
little bit easier for us to issue than

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,750
the annual this strikes me as you guys

173
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,848
at the BCC doing your best to smooth

174
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,129
over some of this turbulence at a time

175
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:31,050
when the locals might still be catching

176
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,360
up and it speaks to it's like I'm

177
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,509
perceiving this philosophy of trying to

178
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,129
keep things moving as best as you can is

179
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,080
that a philosophy that's going on at the

180
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:42,459
BCC yeah I mean I just I'll jump in

181
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,870
here I think I think it's really

182
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,370
important we want to underscore the

183
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,470
point of how important it is to get

184
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,300
people into the market get them a

185
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,610
license get them the ability to get up

186
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,918
and running and get a sense of how it is

187
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,259
to operate in this newly regulated

188
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,758
system so to Lori's point of all the

189
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,560
licenses were issued the temporary

190
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,240
licenses in December that was really big

191
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,918
for us to get people their temporaries

192
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,228
before the ability to get them those

193
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,089
ended at the end of the year so to have

194
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:08,348
those folks in there and now you know

195
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,848
getting up and running and getting a

196
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:11,560
sense of how things are gonna work I

197
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:13,598
think that's that's really important for

198
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,280
us just to dig in real quick when you're

199
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,139
getting an annual licensing what are

200
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,598
tends to be the biggest snacks is it

201
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,449
declaring who's on the ownership is it

202
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,449
the background checks is it a sequel

203
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,310
review if necessary for a store or

204
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,530
distributors or things like that

205
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,430
what do you see consistently coming back

206
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,128
as a snag

207
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,259
I think the biggest thing is getting

208
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,360
through the local jurisdiction process I

209
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,889
think that's probably the biggest hint

210
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,330
getting through building and planning

211
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,180
maybe you have to have a conditional use

212
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:45,128
permit or a special use permit getting

213
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,680
through sequa I think some of the stuff

214
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:49,569
we're seen on rrn like getting a surety

215
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,120
bond or going to get your finger prints

216
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,830
those are just made its education here's

217
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,569
where you go to get that so I think for

218
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:57,399
us it's probably the biggest holdup it's

219
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,500
at the local level well let's stay with

220
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,408
the issue of local control you can't

221
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,810
force a city or county to do anything

222
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:06,519
with regard to cannabis and the total

223
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,709
power rests with the city or county in

224
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,389
terms of shaping what kind of cannabis

225
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:14,019
commerce it wants to have locally and

226
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:15,519
this idea goes back to before America

227
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,149
was America when we were a bunch of

228
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,500
religious fanatics founding colonies

229
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,388
local control was paramount in before

230
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,370
there was counties or States the rule

231
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,439
was was that you know you could dictate

232
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,300
to a large degree what was going on in

233
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,699
your area I think we've seen over the

234
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,190
last two years that a lot of locals have

235
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,719
said we are not prepared for this we're

236
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,909
not trained for this we don't have a

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,490
budget for this why do we have to do

238
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:40,870
this even though a lot of them demand it

239
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,899
you know to be in the driver's seat for

240
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,289
this have you seen this as well and and

241
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:49,089
what can we do to train up locals is

242
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,399
there a way to do a best practices

243
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,529
conference where the state regulators

244
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,820
who are really knowledgeable can drive

245
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:57,100
some of the learnings down to the

246
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,080
local levels how can we get to the point

247
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,100
where these local rules are copy-pasted

248
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,300
able for new jurisdictions so I think

249
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,399
it's important to mention one thing

250
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,870
before we sort of dig into some of the

251
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,340
stuff that we're doing right now and I

252
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,139
may have mentioned this when we were

253
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,490
sitting here last year although I mean I

254
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:14,649
can't even remember what I did two weeks

255
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,310
ago so forgive me if I'm repeating

256
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:21,519
myself but I think in in 2017 as we were

257
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:23,679
leading up to January 1 I want to say

258
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,769
that we spent about a hundred and twenty

259
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,289
days going to different conferences and

260
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,970
local jurisdictions to talk to folks and

261
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,339
really get a sense of what was going on

262
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,040
and I think that what we what we took

263
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,330
back was that we understood that a lot

264
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,719
of them weren't gonna be ready to go on

265
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,370
January 1 of 2018 and we tried to just

266
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,110
reinforce the point that we were always

267
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,330
gonna be a resource and if people had

268
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,800
questions comments or concerns they

269
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,509
could talk to us and they could get in

270
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,059
touch with us and that I think that has

271
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:53,970
helped but I think to David's point I

272
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:56,349
think there's a lot more to be done and

273
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,050
you know I think we're working toward

274
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,060
that now with putting into place this

275
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:03,039
local liaison office that we're trying

276
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:06,219
to hire folks for that can actually work

277
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,659
with cities and counties directly and I

278
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,129
think Laurie might have a better sense

279
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,689
of the timing on that but I think we're

280
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:12,009
trying to get that started and up and

281
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,280
running because it is such a huge piece

282
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:17,289
of the overall process yeah I think

283
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,449
we're finding that the locals are

284
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:21,639
struggling just as confusing it is for

285
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,740
our applicants they're also confused on

286
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,590
what the regulations say what the state

287
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,750
is doing so we've just really recognized

288
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,490
that we have to have a lot more outreach

289
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,830
we've been doing a lot of outreach but

290
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,779
we need to do a lot more and so that's

291
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,690
why we've developed this local liaison

292
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:40,539
unit we've already stired a a manager

293
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,300
for it we're bringing on at least about

294
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:45,579
nine people that are just gonna work

295
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,229
directly with the local jurisdiction and

296
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,120
that's going to include some of their

297
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,399
applicants to that there have that they

298
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,529
are having trouble advising so we're

299
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,699
gonna work directly with them and then

300
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,860
they're gonna have somebody that they

301
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,500
can call directly even though we respond

302
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,850
to inquiries by email you know a lot of

303
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,679
times people want to pick up the phone

304
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,320
and get a real person and we get that

305
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,629
and I love your idea of having like a

306
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,560
best practices conference because we

307
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:10,960
always talk about

308
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,599
everybody's going out to Colorado to go

309
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,278
to these conferences we I think we do it

310
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,879
better here so we should do our own

311
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:21,220
conference here right the California way

312
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,980
i speaking of Colorado they had an

313
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,420
intergovernmental working group that was

314
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,700
in operation for a while

315
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:29,199
designed to play air traffic controller

316
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,640
among all these different agencies

317
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,740
because there's a lot of moving parts

318
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,899
here do we have something similar in

319
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,269
California yet is that maybe on the

320
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,959
horizon or is that being accomplished in

321
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,419
another way

322
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,790
how are you synergizing with the CDFA

323
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:47,588
the CD ph taxes you name it well so just

324
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:50,559
to give you an example when we would

325
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:52,480
have these sort of intergovernmental

326
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,919
meetings every so often where we'd all

327
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,379
get together and try to keep everybody

328
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,449
on the same page with updates and I

329
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,100
think we'd have probably 35 to 40

330
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,050
different representatives in this group

331
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,490
so it's it's the folks that David

332
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:06,969
mentioned it's Public Health its food

333
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,710
nag at CDT fa but it's also EDD and its

334
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,379
water boards and its fish and wildlife

335
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,120
and its you know I mean you can go on

336
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,769
and on down the list it's cal/osha it's

337
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,519
all these different all these different

338
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:20,110
agencies so the coordination is it's not

339
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,639
always easy but I think we've we've

340
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,350
gotten the process down pretty well

341
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,909
where there's always an open line of

342
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,889
communication and especially with food

343
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:29,169
nag and Public Health because those are

344
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,809
we got to work in lockstep so many times

345
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:33,610
with those agencies so I think we're

346
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:36,129
doing a pretty good job it's never it's

347
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,779
never as smooth as you want it to be

348
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,509
it's always the coordination is always

349
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,970
tough especially when people are so busy

350
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:45,250
but I think we do a pretty good job one

351
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,440
thing I've noticed covering cannabis

352
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,409
legalization for nine years is that the

353
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,480
California is paced so far is not at all

354
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:54,370
off pace compared to how other states

355
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,370
have gone when I look at Colorado

356
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,350
Washington Oregon we saw the same ratio

357
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,100
of ban counties to cities and counties

358
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,300
that allow it we saw the same pace of

359
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,680
adoption in terms of implementation at

360
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:08,229
the local level

361
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,838
in 2016 four states legalized cannabis

362
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,879
Nevada California Maine and

363
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,800
Massachusetts we beat all of those

364
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,139
states in terms of implementation and

365
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,399
tax revenue taken Nevada started earlier

366
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,230
than us but we were much bigger than

367
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,149
them and so we eclipsed them Maine's

368
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,580
governor blocked implementations and

369
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:25,009
they made

370
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,690
dollars on their legalization

371
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:29,059
Massachusetts you think you guys got

372
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,690
local control problems go back to Mass

373
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:34,759
and see how the games played back there

374
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,459
but that you know that said are we good

375
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,490
are you seen the pace of implementation

376
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:43,189
improve slow down what's your concerns

377
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,810
there cuz on my side I see Medical

378
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,490
dispensaries in places like Point

379
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:49,250
Hueneme that have never allowed them or

380
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,039
Lompoc and I am starting to see things

381
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,419
break up Emeryville places that on the

382
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,899
cannabis beat you have never heard of

383
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:58,578
before now are finding a way to

384
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,339
licensing can you can't will you guys

385
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:03,769
think about the pace I think it's

386
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,720
improving we're seeing it improved I'm

387
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:08,240
gonna say but it's not as fast as we

388
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,190
need it to go I will say that cuz you

389
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,100
guys want you guys are you guys going

390
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,410
fast so even for the state to keep up

391
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,959
with you it's a challenge and we try and

392
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:20,240
so I think for us we we are just

393
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,018
constantly trying to what more can we do

394
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,639
to get cities and counties to embrace

395
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,759
cannabis regulation because of course we

396
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,740
think if you're regulating it that's got

397
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,208
to be better than not regulating it but

398
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,839
I think we're starting to see that

399
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:37,369
movement again I mean we we thought it

400
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,430
would be at a quicker pace than it was

401
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,720
but we're getting there what are some of

402
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:43,669
the bright spots that have surprised you

403
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,490
I mean Salinas has taken off Santa

404
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:48,469
Barbara County has taken off well I mean

405
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,629
I look at you know part of what I do is

406
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,950
I look so much at the news every day and

407
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:54,259
see what's happening and I think right

408
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,509
after November after the the recent

409
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,278
election I think you saw a lot of local

410
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:01,100
ordinances on ballots all across the

411
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:03,019
state pass which I think we were all

412
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,759
encouraged by and now you know just

413
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:06,889
depends upon the rate of implementation

414
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,809
but I think a lot of those folks that

415
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,669
are in cities and counties that had

416
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:12,649
ordinances passed in November were among

417
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:14,870
those licenses that we were issuing in

418
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,429
December that last push because I think

419
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,139
people sensed a this is our opportunity

420
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,359
to get into the market under the

421
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:23,269
temporary licensure and see how how

422
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,550
quickly we can get up and going so yeah

423
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,019
hopefully in 2019 that that pace sort of

424
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,359
continues and we see more and more of

425
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:32,750
that but we are seeing it and that's I

426
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,490
think the the encouraging thing I'm just

427
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,289
gonna add I definitely think having our

428
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,720
final regulations in place

429
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:40,730
helping because before they weren't sure

430
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,370
we kept changing them right and cities

431
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,620
and counties don't like that just like

432
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,990
you guys probably don't like it either

433
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,448
so I think having just consistency is

434
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,220
going to really help things this year is

435
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:53,899
there any chance that locals will say

436
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,459
gosh this seems like a lot of work I'm

437
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,379
just gonna defer to the state in this

438
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:59,149
regard I feel like when you look at

439
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:01,759
alcoholic beverage control there's a lot

440
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,980
more deference to a state regime and

441
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,259
some very local sort of choose your own

442
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,089
adventure type choices you make about

443
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:10,250
time place and manner of alcohol

444
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,829
delivery but it's it's pretty much run

445
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,899
at the state level has any has there

446
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:17,679
been any talk about locals deferring to

447
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:20,480
state or is that just way off the table

448
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:23,239
we haven't heard too much of it we would

449
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,519
we would welcome that by the way coming

450
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,620
from alcoholic beverage control full

451
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,129
local control has been an adjustment for

452
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,350
me because I'm used to at ABC you were

453
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:35,240
the sole Licensing Authority so you did

454
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,240
defer to the locals for land-use issues

455
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,360
but the state made the final decision so

456
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,669
I think we'd welcome that but I don't

457
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,980
know Alec I think I think I think I

458
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,659
think more probably took the extra time

459
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,699
to just sort of deliberate what they

460
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:51,559
wanted I think if they were gonna accept

461
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:54,289
our rules as written we would have seen

462
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,969
more come online sooner as my if I was a

463
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,528
business owner and I was told in you I

464
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,540
was in a band town or a town that was on

465
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:02,179
the fence can you give me one two three

466
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:04,849
action items the things I should be I

467
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:06,500
should be definitely doing locally that

468
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,568
our table stakes things that if I'm not

469
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,490
doing we can't even be having this

470
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:13,668
conversation is it just civic engagement

471
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,400
is it lobbying is it writing your own

472
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:17,780
initiative yeah what are you telling

473
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,548
business owners who want to get this

474
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:25,428
going locally move consideration but

475
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:26,838
right I mean obviously if you want to be

476
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:30,290
in business now and you're in a band

477
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:32,389
County that that is you have to move

478
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,589
right but if you're where you if you

479
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,659
want to stay where you are because

480
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,428
you've been doing that there for for

481
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:39,700
many years it's really engaging the

482
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,320
local jurisdiction we're starting to see

483
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,630
cannabis business owners run for City

484
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,970
Council Board of Supervisors shout-out

485
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,340

486
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,110

487
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:54,509
which which and and they're winning

488
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,979
right there you go do you guys know the

489
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:58,109
story of South Lake Tahoe clap your

490
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,339
hands a video it's it's worth it's we

491
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:00,869
got to talk about that it's worth

492
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:03,659
talking about

493
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:04,739
so Cody bass is a longtime activist he's

494
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,019
from Plano Texas

495
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,809
his dad was convicted of smuggling he

496
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:12,389
got like a sophomore high school

497
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,970
education dropped out became a ski bum

498
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,400
came to Tahoe SATA who said he was never

499
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,420
leaving worked the chairlifts got into

500
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,880
medical marijuana

501
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,470
grew it helped start a dispensary in

502
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
Berkley cut his teeth on regulations

503
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,720
they're open to club in Tahoe spent ten

504
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,360
years going round and round with locals

505
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,680
over ticky-tack nonsense he they really

506
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,740
raked him over the coals as a small

507
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,710
business owner last year Cody bass ran

508
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,870
for City Council and on the election day

509
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,600
swept out all the older incumbents to

510
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,250
South Lake Tahoe and went out into his

511
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,980
community learned what the real issues

512
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,390
were which were fire control and local

513
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,180
housing issues with regard to Airbnb

514
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,460
seized on those issues not cannabis and

515
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:57,210
now Cody bass sits on the South Lake

516
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,670
Tahoe City Council anybody can do this

517
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,680
it's really inspiring this week the

518
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:05,039
South Lake Tahoe City Council voted to

519
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,080
pass its local cannabis ordinance Cody

520
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,759
bass had to recuse because he's on the

521
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,669
council now so he was in the audience

522
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,650
advocating for his business and I think

523
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,050
was a three to one vote to ensure that

524
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:21,960
that small business has a place in this

525
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:23,399
system so shout out to Cody here so move

526
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,150
on to final regulations which are

527
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,280
permanent down now the number one thing

528
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,710
that people were keeping an eye on in

529
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,019
them was the non storefront delivery

530
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,809
license type now this is what we guys

531
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:39,210
know is retail deliveries and the

532
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,679
license type wasn't in proposition 64 it

533
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,220
actually came out of Governor Browns

534
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,200
office during a legislative session and

535
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,850
I'm never sure why he did this or his

536
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,350
office did this because he's never

537
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:53,219
really carried much water for cannabis

538
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:55,889
but it's a real revolutionary license

539
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,240
type because most states legalization

540
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,160
states there's ten of them now do not

541
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,049
allow delivery your from the Department

542
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,610
of alcohol beverage control the idea of

543
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,619
driving around alcohol and delivering it

544
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:06,869
gave law enforcement officials hives for

545
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,779
years but here we are now with a

546
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:11,129
situation where there's over a hundred

547
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:13,769
delivery services that are licensed to

548
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,990
deliver all across the state now and cut

549
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:19,289
into the lack of access issues in these

550
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,789
banned towns and provide you know taxed

551
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:23,159
and regulated cannabis to the people

552
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:25,200
that voted for it what has been the

553
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,480
response to the final regulations which

554
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,850
codified that storefront licensed and

555
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,920
that non storefront license type can you

556
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:33,539
take me into not the backlash or the

557
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,450
blowback but just the reaction to

558
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:42,750
finalizing that I mean so so I think

559
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:45,330
overwhelmingly positive in terms of the

560
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,220
allowance for delivery I think the road

561
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,168
was was a little bumpy along the way

562
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,490
getting there I think you saw you know

563
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:52,290
the response from League of Cities and

564
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,450
police chiefs but I think the

565
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,129
overwhelming point was just that this is

566
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,860
what the people voted for this is what

567
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,690
they wanted and there was far too many

568
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,308
instances where I think there was some

569
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,220
number I saw where people had to drive

570
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:08,399
you know on average 60 miles just to get

571
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,870
access to to a licensed retailer and for

572
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,019
a lot of people especially patients

573
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,699
that's it's not a possibility so I think

574
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,500
that when you look at when you look at

575
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,150
allowing delivery I think it just is

576
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,339
it's common sense more than anything

577
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:24,809
else and that's the direction that was

578
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:27,359
headed I think it was I think we were a

579
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:29,639
little overwhelmed to that one sentence

580
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,089
in over a hundred and fifty pages of

581
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:36,090
text got the most comments I think we

582
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:41,428
got well over a few thousand comments

583
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:43,019
for against it was huge but we we were

584
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:46,169
getting wheat from the beginning we

585
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:48,179
always felt if we issue a delivery Tale

586
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:50,640
license has the ability to deliver and

587
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:53,669
if we issue that license trying to like

588
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,160
tell that licensee you can only deliver

589
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,169
in this area and that you would have to

590
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,480
have drivers try to figure out when they

591
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:03,480
leave that area would almost be

592
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,690
impossible to regulate and so that was

593
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,640
our our that was our opinion from the

594
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,470
beginning and then we decided we were

595
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,530
getting so many questions we needed to

596
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:16,110
put it in the regs and that was like I

597
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,500
said very controversial but I think it

598
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:19,049
was the

599
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,660
right decision well we'll see what

600
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:23,579
happens because I know they're still you

601
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,830
know many folks that aren't happy with

602
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,970
it at the local level so the final rules

603
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:28,919
were chaptered by the Office of

604
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,930
Administrative Law which scrubs them for

605
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,550
legality and then you guys do your

606
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,690
homework before you propose them in

607
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,889
terms of whether you're not you you

608
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,769
think it's going to withstand a legal

609
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:40,290
challenge can you take us into the legal

610
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:42,720
precedent that might put us on firm

611
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:47,819
footing for allowing this delivery

612
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,009
license type is it I think it's it's the

613
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:52,349
statute itself it's how we interpret the

614
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:54,509
statute that you can't prevent delivery

615
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:56,639
on any public road so I think that's

616
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:57,960
where we're going to be you know that is

617
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,470
what we're gonna have the right-of-way

618
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,029
issue right but of course we don't know

619
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,680
what the legal challenge is going to be

620
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,649
we we haven't gotten one yet

621
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,509
so and then you know the Bureau won't be

622
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,009
defending that that would be our

623
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:13,200
attorney general's office would

624
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:16,109
represent us in something like that I

625
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,120
understand that maybe there's some you

626
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:20,669
know new law that's you know we're in a

627
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,769
new legal territory in that it might

628
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:25,350
have to do with what's delivery where is

629
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:28,049
the point of transaction especially now

630
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:29,759
with Amazon like this issue of the

631
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:31,919
legality of cannabis delivery at the

632
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,289
local level is bigger than cannabis it

633
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,390
relates to online commerce and taxes and

634
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:38,279
the the fundamental limits of police

635
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,520
powers and local control in an

636
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,109
interconnected digitized society where

637
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,789
these transactions could be currying any

638
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:49,289
anywhere and I'm trying to find a

639
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:50,789
question in there but I guess did did

640
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:53,190
that come up in the talk you know Amazon

641
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:56,099
ecommerce where is that place of

642
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,140
transaction is there any parallel or

643
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:01,199
analog you know industries we're looking

644
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,450
at here I think it's tough because you

645
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,100
still can't deliver cannabis through the

646
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,009
u.s. mail because there's federal

647
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:09,569
implications we don't in our regs if you

648
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:13,170
read we don't let you do it by drone

649
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:16,559
either you can't some day maybe right

650
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:18,960
some day so I I think you know in a lot

651
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,259
of ways cannabis delivery is still by

652
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,180
vehicle and so so it's similar to Amazon

653
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:25,829
and those things and those questions

654
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,410
came up but I think for us it was just

655
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,509
simple if we give you a delivery license

656
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,100
you're you you're int

657
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:33,529
to go anywhere in the state to deliver

658
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,539
your drivers and we're regulating you

659
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:38,029
you there's very strict regulations on

660
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:39,920
what a regulated driller delivery driver

661
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:41,480
has to do there's there's limits on how

662
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,910
much they can carry they have to have

663
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,490
GPS the licensee has to know where there

664
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,350
are so we feel like Publix with that

665
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,019
weren't the public safety is more safe

666
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:53,240
with regulated delivery drivers than all

667
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:56,809
the unlicensed delivery drivers that are

668
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,609
out there you know the opposition and

669
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,169
the proponents of delivery made for a

670
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:03,289
real interesting mix of strange

671
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:06,170
bedfellows we saw a cannabis Union the

672
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:08,299
UFCW local 5 team up with I believe

673
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:12,500
maybe the Teamsters and the police and

674
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:14,509
the League and versus others who wanted

675
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,549
delivery in the industry and we also saw

676
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:19,430
local cities sort of mad that you were

677
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:21,649
kind of you know messing with let's face

678
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:25,670
it some like local Oleg appellees or

679
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:28,490
limited amount of Licensing you know who

680
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,620
who do you think is going to lead the

681
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,000
challenge if there is going to be one is

682
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:34,159
there a face of this it seemed like

683
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,750
coming out of delivery I haven't heard

684
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,340
one major group you like we're gonna

685
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,079
take the banner up on this we're gonna

686
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,609
we're gonna fight this over the top do

687
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:44,359
you know where the challenge might be

688
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:47,149
coming from I don't think we do at this

689
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:50,059
point yeah it's it's tough to say I mean

690
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,860
when we saw the whole wandering weed

691
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:54,019
campaign and I'm not sure if it was

692
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:57,019
really happening and it was very under

693
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:59,680
budgeted and yeah cringe worthy I would

694
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:02,029
I would say cringe worthy also so yeah

695
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,470
maybe they lost their their order for

696
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:05,539
this but you know one specific a

697
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,339
delivery that I think is gonna ramp

698
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:10,700
you know amplify down through time is

699
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:13,009
just because locals quote-unquote may me

700
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,440
not have won this round they still have

701
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:17,599
a lot of power and they might do other

702
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,580
things to try to check delivery at the

703
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,859
local level can you go into the

704
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:24,500
specifics of delivery licensing with

705
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:26,389
regard to how close you got to be to a

706
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,279
market to drop it there I understand

707
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,730
that San Diego was saying that like look

708
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,950
ya kaliba can drop in San Diego Khalifa

709
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,750
is a San Jose brand or was a San Jose

710
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:39,289
brand but they have to leave from a

711
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,930
license kalila Khalifa storefront and

712
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:44,119
then go directly to the customer

713
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,788
arguably in San Diego

714
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,859
I think this has to do with a quote ice

715
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:52,819
cream ice cream truck model versus a

716
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:54,888
courier model and is that where is going

717
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:58,038
to be the clarifying points in delivery

718
00:26:54,888 --> 00:27:00,138
going forward does Cole even need a

719
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:01,940
delivery hub in San Diego to draw a

720
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:05,748
licensed delivery hub around San Diego

721
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,220
to drop in San Diego according to the

722
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,139
state regulations as long as they're

723
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,058
leaving from their licensed premises

724
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:13,849
wherever that is I mean they can't

725
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:15,769
necessarily stop along the way and pick

726
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:17,449
up cannabis somewhere else but as long

727
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,308
as they're going straight to there they

728
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,450
can stop for rest breaks and things but

729
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:22,638
as long as they're leaving from their

730
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,649
license delivery that can be anywhere

731
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:26,240
and they can deliver in San Diego now

732
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:28,758
there's restrictions you can't deliver

733
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,980
to like a school or you know public

734
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,019
building you have to you got to go to an

735
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,749
you know actual physical residential

736
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:38,599
address so but what we're starting to

737
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:41,089
see is you know San Francisco City

738
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:43,248
Attorney just came out with a memo

739
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:45,648
saying that they're going to restrict

740
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:47,509
delivery just you have to have a license

741
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:50,028
with the city of San Francisco in order

742
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:51,740
to deliver and I believe they're not

743
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:54,759
going to allow what we call the ice

744
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,288
cream truck or the dynamic delivery now

745
00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:00,169
cities and counties can be more

746
00:27:57,288 --> 00:28:01,759
restrictive than our regulations so but

747
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:03,409
they would be enforcing that on their

748
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,819
own the state wouldn't be enforcing

749
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,950
something like that so I think it's just

750
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:10,058
you're just gonna see a patchwork of

751
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,379
what cities and counties are doing to

752
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:14,269
licensees in their area and what they're

753
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:16,339
gonna require I know some of them want

754
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:18,230
the tax revenues of Khalifa's coming in

755
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:20,118
from the Bay Area to San Diego and

756
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,839
they're making a delivery they want that

757
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:26,178
tax revenue also it sounds like it's to

758
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,668
be determined you know we're gonna have

759
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:31,190
to actually practice you know the

760
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:33,860
delivery license model to kind of suss

761
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,340
out some of the more granular limits of

762
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:39,048
it and how big cities barriers can you

763
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,298
know how big a barrier cities can erect

764
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:44,808
to you know this is sort of right for

765
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:46,429
these businesses just to switch you know

766
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:50,509
to talk about more about final

767
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:52,340
regulations underneath there underneath

768
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,628
delivery which was the big one I'm

769
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:55,398
trying to think you like the second most

770
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:56,899
commented item you've gotten I've heard

771
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:02,058
a lot about package

772
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:03,080
and childproofing and and you know which

773
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:04,579
has been giving a lot of good

774
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:08,750
progressives and environmentalist

775
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:11,299
heartburn we're we're how did you land

776
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:14,269
what was the regulation you landed on

777
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:17,029
and how did you land there well we are

778
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:18,769
one of our proposed regulations because

779
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:21,319
you know last year we had our emergency

780
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:23,150
regs where childproof packaging occurred

781
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,189
at manufacturing and then we when he

782
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:28,370
came out with our proposed in mid-summer

783
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:30,350
we actually proposed that the exit

784
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:33,829
packaging that's required by statute

785
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:36,230
when the retail that we combine that and

786
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:38,899
say that's going to be your childproof

787
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,880
packaging and it would be encompassed in

788
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:45,340
the exit packaging we got a ton of

789
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,830
comments on that also that did not stay

790
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:51,558
we had to change that public health is

791
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:55,159
requiring a childproof packaging at

792
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:58,250
manufacturer for all all manufactured

793
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:02,269
products and including flour there is a

794
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,920
year period to transition so that did

795
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:07,369
not you know that was something we

796
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,740
proposed that didn't stick so we're back

797
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:13,819
to childproof packaging as it originally

798
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,470
was in the emergency reg which was you

799
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:17,869
have a year to get everything into

800
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:21,670
individual childproof bags until that

801
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:25,069
point you can keep it in the exit bag

802
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:27,710
for the next year yes you know sometimes

803
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:30,200
we do try to uncomplicate things but it

804
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:33,230
just seems to get complicated again so

805
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,870
because I don't know where of the mind

806
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,789
if we can make it easy to understand and

807
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:41,779
uncomplicated it's a lot easier for

808
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:43,339
people to comply how much control do you

809
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,690
have over testing and phase three

810
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:46,759
regulations and where those limits are

811
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,390
are is that all with the CD pH or were

812
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:53,808
those fails in the BCC Rex testing labs

813
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:56,059
is under the the bureau originally way

814
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:57,678
back in the day it was under CD pH and

815
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:59,389
then it got transferred to the bureau so

816
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,870
we're responsible for all the testing

817
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,210
very challenging actually like very

818
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:07,189
strict testing regulations right we've

819
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,929
had phase 3 testing rules come into

820
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,259
effect on January 1st everything made

821
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:12,480
before January 1st

822
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:15,509
could sell but after January first you

823
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,549
have to pass tests not only for pest you

824
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:20,490
know pesticides and pathogens and purity

825
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:22,649
and labeling but you gotta not fail for

826
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,200
heavy metals and mycotoxins what have

827
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:28,290
you heard in the early days phase three

828
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,870
going live what has been is it going as

829
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:32,940
planned and what are things failing for

830
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:36,359
what are things that producers need to

831
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,730
look out for going forward so it's it I

832
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,399
think a lot of people were nervous in

833
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,259
December so along with everything else

834
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,840
we were doing everybody was very nervous

835
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:48,029
about Phase three testing I think they

836
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,039
were worried a lot of our tab labs would

837
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:52,680
not be ready to do phase three testing

838
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:54,389
so one of the things we did we sent our

839
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,060
lab folks and they went and visited

840
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,410
every single lab in California to look

841
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,929
at their equipment to make sure they

842
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:04,740
understand the Phase three testing to

843
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:07,080
see how they were using it and you know

844
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,450
we we haven't had any issues most of our

845
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,220
labs are ready to do phase 3 testing

846
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,350
they already had the equipment they got

847
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,410
all their staff trained so we haven't

848
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:18,449
heard too much about it yet but then

849
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,640
again still a lot of there hasn't been

850
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:23,220
as much space retesting yet because a

851
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,700
lot of product was before January 1st so

852
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,970
we're continuing to monitor that you

853
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:33,180
know failed batches continues to be we

854
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:36,559
have a failure rate of just under 13%

855
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,390
and that continues to be mainly for

856
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,669
labeling issues which should make you

857
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,220
feel okay because it's the cannabinoids

858
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:47,100
labeling issues and then probably next

859
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,350
in line is pesticides so those are but

860
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:51,240
really way below the labeling yeah I

861
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:53,909
think I think if you notice if you were

862
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,250
following from you know July up until

863
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,960
now we've got a weekly report that we

864
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,819
send out that you can get access to and

865
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,130
have mailed to you every week so you can

866
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:04,079
see I think the failure rate has

867
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:06,000
continued to drop I think it started at

868
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,609
about 20 and like Laura mentioned it's

869
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,069
under 13% now and it continues to move

870
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:12,839
down I think that just shows that the

871
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:14,700
adaptability and how people are sort of

872
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:17,009
getting used to the the standards and

873
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,900
and and things are progressing so that's

874
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:20,309
that's good one thing I hear from Arin

875
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,140
industry is we're seeing a lot of

876
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:23,730
variance in our lab results were

877
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,100
concerned about the quality of the labs

878
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,990
or

879
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:28,240
I understand that they have until the

880
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,319
end of this year to get ISO certified if

881
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,720
that's correct under international

882
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:33,490
standards for how they're operating but

883
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,500
they're all allowed to sort of skin the

884
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,450
cat their own way as long as the test

885
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,339
results come out valid they can follow

886
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,500
their own sort of protocols how

887
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:43,419
confident are you in your ability to

888
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:48,609
watch the Watchers or is that really

889
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:52,029
with the CD pH well we do work CD pH has

890
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:53,469
a very cannabis lab too so that we do

891
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,819
work with them because they're looking

892
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,799
at all the menu you know because a lot

893
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:58,750
of the problems when you see when things

894
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,240
fail at the laboratory is the

895
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,880
manufacturing process so it's really

896
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,859
working with CD pH to make sure that

897
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,630
we're looking at these manufacturing if

898
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:09,579
we're seeing like a lot of failed

899
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,170
batches coming from one manufacturer

900
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:14,049
they're going in and seeing how they're

901
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:16,030
doing their manufacturing process so III

902
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,670
think that's gonna get that's that's all

903
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,500
gonna that's a process for us and for CD

904
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:24,400
pH and working with the industry but I

905
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,559
think we're getting through that do you

906
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,670
guys have any interaction at the federal

907
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,489
level are you gonna be doing any

908
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:33,280
lobbying or do you keep an eye on what's

909
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,659
happening in DC this year I know last

910
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,590
year you know you said you got to do

911
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,909
what you're gonna do and they're gonna

912
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,740
do what they're gonna do and we're gonna

913
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,940
cross that bridge when we get to it but

914
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:42,969
it seems like things are building in

915
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,990
Congress for you know exempting certain

916
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:45,759
states from the Controlled Substances

917
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:48,669
Act under the state's act

918
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,620
blue man our just introduced s 420 today

919
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:55,059
because you know that's our favorite

920
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:58,109
number what when you look at Congress do

921
00:34:55,059 --> 00:35:00,789
you just go or do you guys engage I

922
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,920
wouldn't say that we engage I say that I

923
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:05,340
say that we monitor things and I think

924
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,860
we we definitely pay attention I think

925
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:11,740
more talk at the federal level can can

926
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,980
be encouraging not always know how much

927
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:16,449
stock to put in and I guess but

928
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,219
thankfully again we we continue to have

929
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:20,529
enough on our plate that we're focused

930
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:22,179
on getting our business done but I think

931
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,490
anytime you hear more chatter about

932
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:27,369
about any movement at the federal level

933
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:29,319
that's that's somewhat encouraging is

934
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:31,089
that something you can endorse at at a

935
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,670
state agency level like we endorse the

936
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:35,710
state's act or is that now we usually

937
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,510
like with with our own legislation even

938
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,429
in California we state

939
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,840
much hands off until it's you know if

940
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:43,000
something passes and we have to

941
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,490
implement some of that or it affects our

942
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,260
program in some way that's when we we

943
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:50,199
jump in and take action but until that

944
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,450
time we we stay pretty pretty much out

945
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:55,000
of any debate about legislation speaking

946
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:55,989
of California legislation in 2019 what

947
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,780
do you hope comes out of this

948
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:01,779
legislative session if anything what are

949
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,880
some red-hot fixes we need if anything

950
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,290
do you sense any signals from the

951
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,119
governor's office in terms of what

952
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,829
direction he wants a legislature to go

953
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,079
they have the supermajority they

954
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:14,889
theoretically could get things done yeah

955
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:17,110
a cannabis is always popular during

956
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:19,869
ledge season so that's great

957
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:22,019
see it's contagious so we expect there's

958
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:25,569
gonna be a lot of bill I bills out there

959
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:28,570
I'm not really sure that you know I've

960
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:30,700
seen a little bit on labs with the

961
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,620
certificate of analysis allowing for

962
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:33,730
like amendments but I really haven't

963
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:35,679
seen too much

964
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,260
I'm really hoping if there is a real

965
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,359
problem with our regulations or

966
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,910
something that we would be working with

967
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,950
the industry to help you know we're more

968
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:49,269
when we say final regs that that's not

969
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:52,239
really final we expect yeah well I mean

970
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:54,130
alcohol wrecks are still evolving change

971
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,529
nothing in out you know what I mean on

972
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:58,720
regs but we're we know we're gonna be

973
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:03,130
doing some reg packages this year and

974
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:04,779
making some fixes so so don't have no

975
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,700
fear we'll be out there again with

976
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,769
probably but it won't be these large

977
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,869
regulations package so I think they'll

978
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:13,119
go fairly smoothly cuz we're only gonna

979
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:15,509
be dealing with you know a little bit of

980
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,960
the rig's rep ponta introduced a tax

981
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:21,450
sort of relief measure into a

982
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,980
democratically controlled legislature

983
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:26,829
you know that is a really interested in

984
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,449
raising revenue right now you know you

985
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,849
guys don't control the tax levels

986
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:32,619
they're in prop 64 and it takes a

987
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,690
two-thirds vote of the legislature to

988
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:36,460
amend them a lot of people in the

989
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,340
audience are hoping for tax relief to

990
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:42,280
drive more people into the legal market

991
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:44,380
you can't give that but do you see other

992
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,080
forces that are affecting prices like

993
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:51,079
that a decline in the price of cannabis

994
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:53,478
coming up I mean I think I

995
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,459
really speak to the decline in and

996
00:37:53,478 --> 00:37:56,958
prices of cannabis but as far as the

997
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:59,358
taxes are concerned I mean this

998
00:37:56,958 --> 00:38:01,518
obviously we saw this bill the same bill

999
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,929
last year and it's one of several bills

1000
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:06,528
that are gonna get reintroduced this

1001
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:08,179
year already have been reintroduced you

1002
00:38:06,528 --> 00:38:09,978
know can't really speak to whether 11

1003
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:11,748
percent is gonna make that much more of

1004
00:38:09,978 --> 00:38:15,679
a difference than 15 percent for most

1005
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:17,718
operators but you know hopefully it's a

1006
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,848
start and you know I think we saw that

1007
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:21,739
bill not not make it through last year

1008
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:23,599
basically because I think they they

1009
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:26,119
looked at what tax revenue was coming in

1010
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,548
and the thought process was well if

1011
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,140
taxes aren't at the level that were we

1012
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:32,509
were expecting then why would we cut

1013
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:35,420
taxes so you could look at that a number

1014
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:37,130
of different ways but I don't know that

1015
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,019
there's gonna be more of a inclination

1016
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,400
to make that work this year I think a

1017
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:43,548
lot of it again is it going to depend on

1018
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,989
what we see from CD TFA's tax reports is

1019
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:46,670
another one coming up I think and then

1020
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,798
within the next week or maybe even a

1021
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,329
couple of days so I'm definitely gonna

1022
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:52,548
keep an eye out on that and see how

1023
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:55,699
things progress Laurie have you seen the

1024
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:59,900
CD yet CD T FAQ for revenue told us can

1025
00:38:55,699 --> 00:39:02,209
you I have not okay I'm not I'm not in

1026
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,249
there secret squirrel world sorry I

1027
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:07,190
called him yesterday he wouldn't tell me

1028
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:08,509
they said February 14th for q4 revenue

1029
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,699
and you know we probably raised several

1030
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:12,469
hundred million last year it's you know

1031
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:16,068
a couple hundred million here there and

1032
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:19,458
real money this year you guys got ten

1033
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:22,659
million to do some equity type of grants

1034
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:25,788
that doesn't seem like very much money

1035
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:28,478
but I wanted to throw it to you about

1036
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:30,949
you know when can we expect to equity

1037
00:39:28,478 --> 00:39:34,759
applicate grant application form to come

1038
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:36,680
out and what might be on it I know we

1039
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:39,318
got two minutes oh that that's gonna be

1040
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:42,498
coming out very very soon that's all I

1041
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:45,739
can say and we try to simplify this

1042
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:48,889
right we keep saying that we have ten

1043
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:51,409
million which is not a lot to provide to

1044
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:53,598
local jurisdictions that have equity

1045
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:56,929
programs one license with ten million

1046
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,699
dollars yeah so we tried to make an

1047
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:01,759
application process that's going to be

1048
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:04,220
very easy for the locals to apply

1049
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,660
and us to be able to track what what

1050
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:07,819
they're doing with the money and we're

1051
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:10,069
hoping this catches on and there were

1052
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,170
very successful for the for the

1053
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,940
jurisdictions that get this money that

1054
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,010
you know maybe we're gonna see more

1055
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,630
local jurisdictions adopting a local

1056
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,250
equity program the cannabis industry

1057
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,140
isn't the first one to face equity

1058
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,909
problems and there's been other attempts

1059
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:26,299
in the past you know small business

1060
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:28,549
loans minority points on government

1061
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,910
contracts where else can people look in

1062
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:33,950
the state apparatus for a leg up if

1063
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:35,299
anywhere I mean you've been in the state

1064
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:37,789
for a while now what are the go-to

1065
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:41,420
programs for you know help before

1066
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:43,789
cannabis existed so I think we we got it

1067
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,280
we have to do more money is great and

1068
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:48,019
but I think at the state level and and

1069
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,690
we're looking we keep looking at this

1070
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:53,590
issue how can we make you know reduce

1071
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:56,539
barriers to entry to get people into

1072
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:58,160
licenses to assist them with with

1073
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:59,900
getting a license you know one of the

1074
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:03,049
things the equity program the the

1075
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:06,440
legislation that Senator Bradford passed

1076
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,539
is we are going to have four people that

1077
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,460
just provide technical assistance to the

1078
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:12,739
local jurisdictions that have equity

1079
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,570
program and their equity applicant so I

1080
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:17,869
think we need to do a better job of

1081
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:20,539
making sure people understand how to get

1082
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:22,880
licensed and we try to reduce that those

1083
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:24,289
barriers but also we have to encourage

1084
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,090
you know we've got a lot of small

1085
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:27,559
cultivators that are trying to sell

1086
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,740
their product through the supply chain

1087
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:32,779
how do we incentivize our distributors

1088
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:35,509
and our retailers to buy from those

1089
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,720
equity applicant cultivators or

1090
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,820
manufacturers and so and it's just

1091
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,439
that's a bigger conversation than just

1092
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,150
the bureau it's really engaging the

1093
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,679
industry with this and seeing how we

1094
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,570
what we can do if there's something we

1095
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,369
can do with our regs is how we change

1096
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,930
you know how do we incentivize other

1097
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:53,119
businesses and I think that's what we're

1098
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:56,529
gonna look to explore this year two more

1099
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,730
questions oh there's one more

1100
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,600
enforcement's a reality this year what

1101
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:04,159
is your priorities so just really

1102
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,920
quickly if I had the breaking news

1103
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,589
little music in the background it's just

1104
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,380
better released this morning about our

1105
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:15,140
enforcement unit shutting down an

1106
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,579
illegal retail or legal delivery service

1107
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:17,618
and

1108
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:20,650
cormaneau and an illegal storefront in

1109
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,809
Los Angeles so activity is happening on

1110
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,568
that front it's we've talked about this

1111
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:26,859
a few times how 2019 is gonna be you

1112
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,900
know a year of enforcement we're gonna

1113
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:30,639
really get out there our cannabis

1114
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,608
Enforcement Unit is working with local

1115
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,989
law enforcement local governments we're

1116
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:36,699
getting we're continuing to get

1117
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:38,440
complaints about illegal activity we're

1118
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:40,118
following up on all those and so I think

1119
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,068
you're gonna see more of this type of

1120
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,289
activity and we have a public education

1121
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:45,608
public awareness campaign coming out

1122
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:48,700
we're really going to try to get after

1123
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:50,528
those illegal operators digital messages

1124
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:53,348
not just the cease and desist letters

1125
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:55,748
and then also really trying to encourage

1126
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:57,940
the consumer to buy from their licensed

1127
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:59,199
retail location so that campaign

1128
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,179
hopefully is going to be starting

1129
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,708
sometime early next month and you'll

1130
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,419
you'll definitely see some things

1131
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:06,009
happening pretty quickly well guys were

1132
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,719
out of time I just want to wait I'm

1133
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:09,190
sorry I just have one question let's

1134
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,179
hear it for David and Lori and

1135
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,179
submersible north on
