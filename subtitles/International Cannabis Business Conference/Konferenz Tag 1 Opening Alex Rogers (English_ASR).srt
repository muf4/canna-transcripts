1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,099
yo how y'all feeling this morning you

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,099
feeling good at the ICBC everyone

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,440
my name is Alex Rogers I'm the CEO and

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:22,039
founder of the ICBC I um I started this

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,320
event I came to Berlin in 216.

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,820
and I had a vision of B2B cannabis in

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,099
Europe something similar to what was

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,679
going on in America at the time and I

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,079
came over here and everybody said I was

10
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,058
crazy literally you know my German

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,280
friend said Alex Alex we are very

12
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,738
worried for you you know we we are how

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,719
do you say a frugal people 500 a ticket

14
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,399
is too much for us and I said and they

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,140
said we're very worried and they're very

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,020
direct in your very direct germanness

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,640
and I said well I'm very worried too

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,379
thank you very much for that uh brutal

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,119
honesty but what it made me do is it

20
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,420
made me work even harder to make this

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,878
vision and dream come true and all I did

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,640
was just you know put some blank pages

23
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,938
out and you guys filled all those blank

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,939
pages so the Cannabis industry the ICBC

25
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,938
you guys this is where it all gets done

26
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,639
this is where we we we we catapult the

27
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,039
industry at a rapid rate to the next

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
level now the first thing I said when I

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,100
got on stage in 217 at the first ICBC

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
was that the policy makers and the

31
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,959
administrators would pardon my French

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,299
even though we're in Germany things

33
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,639
up and that's normal because I had

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,799
already been in jurisdictions where I

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,840
had seen administrators you know it's

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,079
politics we understand whether it's with

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,540
tax or regulations or cumbersome fees

38
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,118
you know the idea is to take it off the

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,979
the black market right and I think

40
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,659
people will pay a little bit more to

41
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,938
know that they have a regulated product

42
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,340
we know that but there's a point where

43
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,319
if it's too much more they'll choose to

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,359
go to the underground so that can't be

45
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,658
lost on what what's coming with this

46
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,759
market and to be cognizant of of that uh

47
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,859
and understand going forward we really

48
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,379
need to concentrate on on on on on

49
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,739
things like that so we actually do have

50
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,019
a nascent Market a thriving market and a

51
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:17,280
very prosperous Market what I did also

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,860
say on stage was that uh on in 217 the

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,239
first ICBC Berlin event who was that

54
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,120
raise your hand if you were at the first

55
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,819
ICBC event all right raise your hand if

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,739
this is your first ICBC event ever yeah

57
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,139
a lot of new faces that's great that's

58
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,459
beautiful so what I said was I said that

59
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,219
politicians they're going to mess things

60
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,620
up now I'm paraphrasing myself and

61
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,659
what's going to happen is what the most

62
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,000
important thing is that you have a home

63
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,219
garden and you decriminalize cannabis

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,459
you make this flower not a crime anymore

65
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,259
well what's happened in Germany this is

66
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,239
exactly what they want to do and I know

67
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,159
everybody has a different opinion on

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,920
what's going on right now but I will

69
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,378
tell you now after all these years after

70
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,559
all these years this Movement we have

71
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:04,620
now in Germany is a good thing and it's

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,780
incumbent upon us as stewards of the

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,420
industry to protect

74
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:15,000
nourish and make this uh uh industry uh

75
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,039
go forward and like I said before be

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
prosperous so please give yourself a big

77
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,000
