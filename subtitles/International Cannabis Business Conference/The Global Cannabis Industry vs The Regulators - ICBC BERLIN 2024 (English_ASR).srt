group and a licensed attorney so my

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
experience with cannabis first came as

69
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,280
my job as an attorney as a defense

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
attorney but then I went into the

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,919
cannabis industry like a year and a half

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,400
two years ago so I'm pretty new to this

73
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,798
still learning uh and the ton group now

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,879
basically what we're doing is we're

75
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,200
connecting different participants in

76
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,639
this industry uh I find it very

77
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,919
interesting I learn something new every

78
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,798
day and I expect to do it even today you

79
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,759
know we say time working in the Cannabis

80
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,719
industry is like dog years um so you've

81
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,239
been in the industry for a while now

82
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,439
I've seen you here a few times feel like

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,438
that yeah exactly all right we're going

84
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,239
to talk today about the challenges faced

85
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,239
by uh the abis industry the biggest

86
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,280
regulatory challenges the relationship

87
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,719
between the regulators and the regulated

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,239
in the Cannabis industry I would like to

89
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,799
address you guys with the first question

90
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,840
what really what are the biggest

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,159
challenges in this industry that you

92
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:54,959
face um whoever wants to take it up

93
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:57,719
first um maybe I do I mean from I

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,400
learned is uh that we don't have a

95
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,120
constant especially in Germany where we

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,079
have a federal system or The Regulators

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,200
more or less apply the rules in a

98
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,560
different way just to give you a little

99
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,878
example we have a client to have two

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,280
clients um both of them from Israel both

101
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:18,478
of them they want to obtain eug GMP so

102
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,478
we need an audit the um the the

103
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,879
regulator from Bavaria allows an online

104
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,199
audit for obvious reasons actual and the

105
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,560
other one we are struggling uh with the

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,319
regulator we try to argue well there's

107
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,959
an

108
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,680
MR uh the

109
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,478
Israeli GMP is basically way more harder

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,840
than the European

111
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,478
one I'm all as we stuck so I mean and I

112
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,560
don't know when the political situation

113
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:46,240
in Israel will be better and the clients

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,120
want that early yeah they're eager to

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,879
obtain the EU GMP and to be yeah to be

116
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,079
able to to Market their their product

117
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,680
that's super interesting but you're

118
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,159
already going really quite into the

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,600
specifics that that's what I asked but

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,439
let's start a bit more in the meta field

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,479
because essentially there's one

122
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:10,199
overarching theme on on on on the

123
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:13,758
highest level which is the uh narcotic

124
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,439
you know the the for okay basically

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,680
that's where it starts um the inational

126
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,199
conventions maybe you can speak about

127
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,759
that and why the single convention may

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,919
be one of the biggest impediments to to

129
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,120
a harmonized uh framework well um I'm

130
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,359
saying that for a very long time uh that

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,759
for us the Cannabis industry um the

132
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,439
single convention is actually a big big

133
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
trade barrier that is limiting us uh

134
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,478
because of the status of the flour and

135
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,800
the resin um as a narcotic drug um that

136
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,719
has a lot of implications it also to a

137
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,960
certain degree provides the framework um

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,520
but I mean that's not only uh the only

139
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,239
aspect in there that's the biggest

140
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,240
Global aspect that but again I also see

141
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,120
a lot of limitations and restrictions

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
through the appropriate marketing

143
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,478
category it's something that I call

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,478
category appropriate marketing so that

145
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,839
like really the companies understand

146
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:11,159
what category their ingredient relates

147
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,839
to and um I mean here the focus is

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,199
really more on those things like um the

149
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,560
Cannabis flour and the resin uh but

150
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,919
there are way other um areas like also

151
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,759
in construction or in developing novel

152
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,399
um cellular based solutions that are

153
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,639
highly limited through that barrier so

154
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,839
one of the barriers really I would say

155
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
in in the single ition is that it only

156
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,959
allows

157
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,318
crossborder cooperation in the fields of

158
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,478
scientific research and in the medical

159
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:43,280
space and it doesn't open up anything

160
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,959
for the recreational space right that I

161
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:50,959
would say is like the the first level of

162
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:54,359
challenge that we have for sure and and

163
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,918
also we as members of European Union I

164
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,360
mean you're a bit different from

165
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,680
Switzerland besides yeah well because

166
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,038
you besides the un convention we also

167
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,680
have the European legislations and as we

168
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,719
all know the UN they have no actually no

169
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,038
punitive approach towards countries who

170
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,440
would be in breach while the European

171
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:15,279
commission they have quite severe

172
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,598
punishes that could be inflicted on the

173
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,839
member states that would break it so for

174
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,399
European member states that's an

175
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,000
additional issue uh I think as European

176
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,959
State we would have we would have it

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
hard to allow ourselves to do for

178
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,120
example like what Canada did or what

179
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,280
some other countries did because because

180
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,560
the European commissions like they they

181
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,839
had experience in Germany when they

182
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,879
first came to the European commission

183
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,799
and asked could we legalize for

184
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,599
recreation use and they they were told

185
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,560
quite frankly no you cannot we will sue

186
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,120
in front of the

187
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,079
court okay so enforcement is a big issue

188
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
but also what you addressed really is

189
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,000
the interpretation of what cannabis

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,038
means the definition in the single

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,800
convention uh which really does not

192
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,719
distinguish because it the single

193
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,800
convention was was created at the time

194
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,919
where people have not discovered THC yet

195
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,639
um and it actually comprises everything

196
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,719
that's derived from the cannabis plant

197
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,120
and from the fruiting tops and so on and

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,280
these definitions do you think the the

199
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
interpretation of these definitions is

200
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,439
that something Universal

201
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,360
or is it something where you have a an

202
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,158
individual interpretation in each

203
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,560
jurisdiction yeah I'd say that every

204
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:28,279
single country comes at cannabis um with

205
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,360
usually not enough information and so

206
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,519
their understanding of um the different

207
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,399
plant components and what they contain

208
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,360
and what the potential uses of them are

209
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,799
is very different so um I was just

210
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,519
helping one of my clients go through the

211
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,439
narcotics Licensing in Switzerland and

212
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,759
then we had a meeting with the

213
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
regulators and they said um okay so we

214
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:47,200
want you to destroy all of the Cannabis

215
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,279
waste that has THC in it and I said THC

216
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,080
or thca and they just stared at me and

217
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,320
they said what do you mean I said well

218
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,720
the leaves and the stocks don't have uh

219
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,519
THC inside of them or at a certain level

220
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,160
um so what are we going with I mean your

221
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,799
rule is anything below 1% th HC is is

222
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,159
hemp material CBD material um so how do

223
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,159
you want to do this and they were just

224
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,159
completely lost on you know they didn't

225
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,799
understand that it's not everything is

226
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,000
consistent throughout the entire plant

227
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,039
so uh what we ended up having a chat

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,679
with them about is saying okay look how

229
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,919
about when we do our first few rounds of

230
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,559
Destruction we'll actually do an hlc

231
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,919
analysis for the level of THC thca in

232
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,239
the different types of waste matter and

233
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,759
if we can prove to you that it's below

234
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,079
the threshold can we just throw it in

235
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,838
the regular garbage and they were like

236
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,039
okay yeah that seems reasonable but you

237
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,959
have to come up with these Solutions

238
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,639
yourself otherwise you're paying you

239
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,359
know we have to do a pay pay for our

240
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,240
destruction in Switzerland so you're

241
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,120
paying a lot of extra money to haul off

242
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,600
product that could just go in the

243
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
regular waste if you don't come up with

244
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,560
these solutions to um not challenge The

245
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,360
Regulators but I guess to help inform

246
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,838
them on you know the knowledge of the

247
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,919
plant that we have as industry experts

248
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,360
absolutely and on top of that we also

249
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,278
have very different regulations

250
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,800
depending on which product regulatory

251
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:57,919
category we put a product in and in

252
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,559
Switzerland for example where I'm from

253
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,759
Cannabis up to a with the THC content of

254
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,119
up to 1% is not considered a narcotic

255
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,120
drug that's already not harmonized

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,039
because in Europe it's 0.3% we have

257
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,759
other jurisdictions within Europe that

258
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:15,159
accept up to

259
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:17,039
0.6% it's it's quite a wide area um and

260
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,600
if I may address something in

261
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,199
Switzerland now that's interesting it's

262
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,519
the first time that uh uh the Swiss

263
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,839
medic and federal Office of Public

264
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,959
Health has put out uh an information

265
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,839
that uh in in the field of cosmetics

266
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,278
regul ation for example anything that

267
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,680
goes up to 1% is not considered narcotic

268
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:41,159
drug there was a big uh issue about

269
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:45,039
whether THC could be whether cosmetic

270
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:48,679
products could uh entail or or have

271
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:51,278
component of THC at all because there's

272
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,599
a prohibited narcotic regulation in

273
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:58,039
cosmetics and now the regulator actually

274
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,480
made clear up to 1% is more or less fine

275
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,799
we'll see how that pans out in

276
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,240
enforcement but that's where we are

277
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,639
today in Switzerland uh if I can just

278
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,759
jump in uh we have a very interesting

279
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,759
situation in Slovenia uh with hemp yeah

280
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,679
uh we're like most of European countries

281
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,958
up to 0.3 it's supposed to be hemp but

282
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,638
the the position of our Supreme Court is

283
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,078
that on the list of ilicit drugs in

284
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,079
Slovenia is cannabis as a plant so it

285
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,399
doesn't matter if it's 0.2 0.3 if you

286
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,479
cultivate it it's a criminal offense

287
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,399
unless you have a you have a license

288
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,079
from the ministry of agriculture if you

289
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,078
don't have it and you cultivate hemp

290
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,159
it's a criminal offense regardless of

291
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,000
what the THC level is on the other hand

292
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,399
we have the National Institute of Health

293
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,879
who says no no industrial H is legal you

294
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,639
can grow it you can do everything so not

295
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,240
even the regulators and the courts are

296
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,839
on the same page

297
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,919
ship sometimes also the regulator just

298
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,760
tells you to sue them because they just

299
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,838
can't change the situation by themselves

300
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,200
so that's the way we have to go via

301
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,279
courts yeah and as we know that's

302
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,959
something that's uh difficult to afford

303
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,600
for many companies and also takes a lot

304
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,000
a lot of time and I think the reason we

305
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,399
came to this place in Switzerland is

306
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,440
because it's already been 3 years that

307
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,159
uh also myself have been litigating

308
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,800
these cases but it's 3 years on that

309
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,120
they've realized that they can't just

310
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,359
take the definition of the single

311
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,879
convention but actually have to take a

312
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,039
specific interpretation into into

313
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,519
account maybe you can speak about uh

314
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,480
your experiences now we take it we we we

315
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,679
spoke on a meta level maybe we take it a

316
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,399
bit more down to a country level um

317
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,239
what's your experience in Germany with

318
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,919
those Regional differences can you dive

319
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,159
a bit uh into more detail there it

320
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,039
depends on uh really on the local

321
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,559
regulator if you look on to Northern

322
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,000
vest failure they're pretty open-minded

323
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,399
uh Bavaria as well even though that uh

324
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,320
for the upcoming uh recreational Market

325
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,839
we see that uh Bavaria will be a

326
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,399
hellhole more or less um they already uh

327
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,839
put on um an executive order allowing um

328
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:11,559
people um to be fined if they smoke with

329
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,839
youngsters miners I mean um so at the

330
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,799
given moment there's no let's say red

331
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,440
line in between The Regulators whether

332
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,719
you and I'm assuming it's going to be

333
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,399
the same way for um recreational Market

334
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,079
as well as um or the medical Market in

335
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,600
in general so there's no red line more

336
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:31,120
or less it's uh you have to have

337
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:36,000
experience where you apply for your

338
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,519
medical license import or um uh

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,958
wholesale and uh I'm assuming it's going

340
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:44,320
to be the same thing for um for cannabis

341
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,719
clubs especially for the uh for the

342
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,360
production

343
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,600
sites maybe you've heard that um uh Mr

344
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,839
laak that's our health Minister he

345
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,680
issued

346
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:59,880
a I don't know what to call it it's like

347
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:02,399
um yeah a protocol um

348
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,958
protocol before the election on the

349
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,039
second chamber in which he said for the

350
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:11,679
CSC for the canabas clubs we represent

351
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:15,039
that pulling up production sites is not

352
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,559
allowed but yeah that changes a lot in

353
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,039
the in the whole economic view even

354
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,559
though I'm not allowed to say is that

355
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,439
The Binding order that was issued or

356
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:27,000
what's the legal nature of that we don't

357
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,519
know this has never been done before no

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,399
but maybe I can say something in that

359
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,000
regard like we've had this discussions

360
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,000
and we have a couple of members in our

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,639
industry Association who also want to

362
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,198
pursue that model so now we have that

363
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:43,039
limitation it just it's still in in the

364
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:45,919
formulation as it said it's unclear how

365
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,719
many clubs can be in one location to not

366
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,198
be considered many so it's still there

367
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,120
may be some clubs together in one spot

368
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:57,879
but if too many are 10 or 15 is unclear

369
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,480
so we have to see how this all rolls out

370
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,439
yeah but I think like uh one point that

371
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,600
is very important here to show is um

372
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,759
that we just have defragmented uh

373
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,720
regulations across the globe so it is

374
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,720
also up to us if we want to have more um

375
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,959
safety in acting and safety in um how we

376
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,759
can make a transnational trade we would

377
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,958
we all need to Lobby more for more

378
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,639
harmonized rules and regulations or the

379
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,159
thing that you just said with the CBD

380
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,120
cosmetics in Switzerland we have the

381
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,078
same issue here where some um

382
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,799
entrepreneurs from Hamburg have been

383
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:32,239
facing they just did Regular CB D Oil

384
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,639
yeah um and as a cosmetic and they've

385
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,159
been facing charges for Narcotics traits

386
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,120
so those kind of things come from the

387
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,838
single convention so um I'll stick with

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
my statement that we all need to Lobby

389
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,160
to get cannabis out of the single

390
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,919
convention because otherwise we'll be

391
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,240
stuck with this yeah but we do know

392
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,198
that's going to be a long shot and it's

393
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,399
going to take many years until this will

394
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,318
be implemented are there now there's

395
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,839
movement and The Regulators start to get

396
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:58,519
interested in these kind of topics they

397
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,839
want to create Solutions before that it

398
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:04,399
was just like cannabis no yeah now all

399
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,519
for a sudden this huge massive economy

400
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,078
pops up and there's a willingness to

401
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,919
create new regulations or to have uh

402
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,278
standards for audits I mean that's also

403
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,198
potentially a lot of your work at Tia um

404
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,559
talking with The Regulators about just

405
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,120
explaining how this is possible

406
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,479
explaining cannabis to them because they

407
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,240
have no clue yeah it's actually really

408
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,720
shocking like because I work in so many

409
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,198
different markets the whole reason I

410
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,480
started the association is I would just

411
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,919
see things that were written in

412
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,920
regulations or things that my clients at

413
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,078
here to that just made absolutely no

414
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:34,958
sense you know deciding that uh every

415
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,559
five or 15 pounds of finished product is

416
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,799
its own individual batch there's no

417
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,039
reason to do that but they're just you

418
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,159
know racking up millions of dollars in

419
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,278
testing fees um like you mentioned too

420
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,958
even with having clients in Switzerland

421
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,399
wanting to sell CBD into Germany we're

422
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,278
doing these really dangerous chemical

423
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,399
wash Downs it's it's making the product

424
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:50,759
garbage to be honest and they're

425
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,639
respraying it with the turpine spray and

426
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,839
they're pumping it into Germany um if

427
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,440
they could just come to an understanding

428
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,160
of the same level of a THC limit for the

429
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,360
product to move freely across even just

430
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,039
Europe alone

431
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,159
that would be great um so we need to

432
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,318
have more of this International

433
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,279
harmonization because I think that as an

434
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,279
industry we need to come together and

435
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,879
and unify a little bit more I move

436
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,078
product around the world all the time

437
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,360
and it's it's always this weird

438
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,000
Balancing Act I mean even when we move

439
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,558
um product out of Switzerland that's

440
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,078
over 0.6 0.7 that's immediately a

441
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,759
narcotic in other countries right so um

442
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,359
there needs to be this kind of

443
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,359
assistance I think for the regulators

444
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,438
and um Lisa is totally right like a lot

445
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,479
of them weren't open to any information

446
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,160
really and as countries have come online

447
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,679
and a lot of them have made mistakes or

448
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,480
they've kind of made missteps I would

449
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,559
say they're now a lot more open for

450
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,079
these conversations and these

451
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:38,798
discussions and saying okay maybe we

452
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,519
don't know what we're doing um maybe

453
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,279
it's a bit more complex than we thought

454
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,038
you know where can we get some guidance

455
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,440
we feel the same in Switzerland to be

456
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,759
honest it was a very difficult

457
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,160
conversation in the beginning but it's

458
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,440
also understandable because to some

459
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,159
extent uh we're talking about some

460
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,600
tension between illicit markets where uh

461
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,159
operators had to learn to find the path

462
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,918
of least resistance for marketability

463
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:06,559
right and and now suddenly markets are

464
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,640
opening up but to a very small degree

465
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,720
and in a very complex Manner and

466
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,360
suddenly you have to take into account

467
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,919
uh various product regulatory Fields

468
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,158
like Cosmetics regulation food stuffs

469
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,640
regulation chemical regulation

470
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,280
therapeutic product act regulation and

471
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,600
and they don't understand the context

472
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,798
and they just bring products to Market

473
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:29,678
and this creates a lot of tension and

474
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,679
frustration on the side of the authority

475
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,360
and understandably a little bit an an

476
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:38,400
attitude of uh of resistance yes Lisa

477
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,399
maybe also interesting for Switzerland

478
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,000
particularly because you had that CBD

479
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,798
the massive CBD boom yeah and there were

480
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,079
all these producers coming up like offer

481
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,879
sudden there's a massive oversupply I

482
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,519
mean um some of that cannabis definitely

483
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,559
also went into let's say unregulated or

484
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,200
even illicit value chains from that

485
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,480
because it was not properly um tracked

486
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,679
and there were no rules to keep the

487
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,440
product in the legal market so that is

488
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,960
definitely something that I think is

489
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,679
should be like on our list of priorities

490
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,400
to also build value chains where the

491
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,960
product stays in the value chain and

492
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,840
does not migrate anywhere at some point

493
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,360
and then you have other issues popping

494
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,279
up through that and then the regulator

495
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,558
will be unhappy again so it's also like

496
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,678
that we need to find some solutions and

497
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:25,678
make this more tangible more uh

498
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,960
traceable and make it like so it's um

499
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,798
transparent and yeah just to make this a

500
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,919
bit more specific what you're speaking

501
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:36,038
about is actually CBD flour being sold

502
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,559
into the illicit Market because CBD

503
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:41,279
flour is relatively cheap versus THC and

504
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,879
then it's simply sprayed with synthetic

505
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,798
cannabinoids or even spice spice and

506
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,480
then uh distributed in the market and uh

507
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,839
there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

508
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,519
product from Switzerland that actually

509
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,480
ends up in the black market it's not

510
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,400
it's an Open Secret and that's very

511
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,480
harmful for the conversation with the

512
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,000
regulator can can you guys tell me a

513
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,919
little bit how this how how is this

514
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,440
conversation with the regulator when you

515
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,440
speak when you say you meet with the

516
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,720
regulator are the barriers very high do

517
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,759
you get the meetings easily how does it

518
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,159
work in

519
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,119
Slovenia well in Slovenia it might be a

520
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,360
bit easier because we're a small country

521
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:21,038
so it's kind of easier to get in touch

522
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:25,279
with them and the approach that we took

523
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:27,279
is up until like 8 n months ago the

524
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,720
situation was really bad I mean the it

525
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,079
was everything was banned and there was

526
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,400
no understanding on the side of the

527
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:36,158
regulator also due to the fact that as

528
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,000
we basically all mentioned they they

529
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,480
didn't know much about it uh and so we

530
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,400
in September we said okay let's organize

531
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,319
a conference actually with the help of

532
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,919
ICBC uh science and technology and we

533
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,879
invited a lot of scientists and a lot of

534
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,600
politicians also the members of the

535
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,919
government came and we showed them look

536
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,759
cannabis is not just people smoking on

537
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,759
the streets it's not just ston heads

538
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,558
it's a whole industry behind it and not

539
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,640
just medical a lot of it and this was

540
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,918
kind of the first step so a couple of

541
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,000
months later with the help of the cancer

542
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,840
patient Society we organized an event in

543
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,839
our National Assembly or now in the

544
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,678
National Council and it helped which

545
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,359
would be like the bundes yeah I know

546
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,679
Alex shared a few of those pictures on

547
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,759
LinkedIn so we saw that yeah it's great

548
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,240
so and it was I mean even for me it was

549
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:27,079
in a bit surprising that in in such

550
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,000
short few months we managed to get

551
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,519
basically to the Parliament and helped

552
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,440
and now they're willing to listen and

553
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm having I'm having a meeting next

554
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,720
week with with the government to talk

555
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,278
about a new bill and everything so

556
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,759
things are moving forward and as I said

557
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:42,599
we took the approach of showing them

558
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,400
what cannabis can be so I think this is

559
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,278
a very interesting framework and maybe

560
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,880
it can be implanted in other

561
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,919
jurisdictions um in Switzerland I feel

562
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,320
and in other European countries uh The

563
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,840
Regulators have understood that the the

564
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,879
current framework of uh narcotics

565
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,959
regulation has failed yeah and and even

566
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,600
addiction organizations and so on are

567
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,079
all advocating for an opening of the

568
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,319
market for other Frameworks so our

569
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:11,359
experience is also they're very happy to

570
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:13,798
listen and we have the pilot projects

571
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,359
now going on what I'm interested in

572
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:16,960
because we don't have much time left and

573
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,519
I want to leave some time for a few

574
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,360
questions as well ATA you're in one of

575
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,319
the most you you live in Thailand now

576
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:28,759
which is an interesting Market I've been

577
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,278
there recently and um it's cannabis is

578
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,000
just omnipresent it's an absolute

579
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,798
Madness maybe you can give us a little

580
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,319
bit of insights from your experiences

581
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,278
what's happening there yeah I mean I

582
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,119
actually moved Thailand to Thailand

583
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:41,119
specifically uh from Canada because I

584
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,558
had been kind of splitting my time

585
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,479
between Canada and Europe for the past

586
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,558
few years um what Thailand has done no

587
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,000
other country will ever do again that no

588
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,480
other country will say just do whatever

589
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,640
you want and we'll see what happens for

590
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
cannabis so I wanted to go down and kind

591
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,840
of see it up close and personal and it

592
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,278
is it's quite wild uh there's 6,000

593
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,839
dispensaries there's no enforcement no

594
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,440
one is really coming around the products

595
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,959
that they they do have a small law

596
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,200
saying are illegal are all available in

597
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,079
the stores um there's no supply chain

598
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,720
tracking there's no traceability so

599
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,399
there are a lot of really fantastic

600
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,880
operators especially the clients that I

601
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,440
work with that are pushing forward and

602
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,760
they're doing a lot of self-regulation

603
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,080
and they're trying to export of course

604
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,079
so they're trying to adhere to

605
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,399
International standards or get GMP or at

606
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,240
least gcp um so there's people there

607
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,880
that are you know making those changes

608
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,558
themselves but the government's really

609
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,320
lagged behind on that and they're not

610
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,599
really well informed on what they need

611
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,558
to do so they're now trying to kind of

612
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,240
reverse a little bit and so what we've

613
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,798
heard is that they want to basically

614
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,720
make recreational no longer allowed and

615
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,759
switch to Medical now when we say switch

616
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
to Medical I mean I think the maybe a

617
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,119
few months ago that news came out

618
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,038
everyone was like are you moving out of

619
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,639
Thailand like are you leaving everybody

620
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,319
on the ground is just still working

621
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
nobody has stopped everyone's expanding

622
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,240
their facilities everyone's continuing

623
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,480
um it's a huge Revenue stream no

624
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,120
government really tends to say you know

625
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,240
fine get rid of the revenue um so is is

626
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,199
is cannabis taxed is are there taxes not

627
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,558
as much as it should be because they

628
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,640
don't have supply chain traceability

629
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,798
right so they don't really know how much

630
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,240
each producer is making they don't

631
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,480
really know how much is going into

632
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,278
different areas so I think they do

633
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,640
taxing on some things but not enough

634
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,440
from the incb requirements also they

635
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,480
they should need that need to know that

636
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,400
yeah or isn't that like a requirement

637
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,880
for what sorry that you document how

638
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,720
much cannabis you're producing for the

639
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,159
international narcotics control board

640
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,919
yes you're supposed to but look we we've

641
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,440
seen in Canada you're we've seen the

642
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,320
world do end if you don't comply I'm to

643
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,759
German for that so also yeah yeah maybe

644
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:38,720
we need more we call it right to to

645
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,079
actually go and and and do some and and

646
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,519
push the barriers um I think we have a

647
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:46,158
few minutes left maybe we can take some

648
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,158
questions from the

649
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,079
audience uh thank you uh I'm Martin from

650
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,679
from SGS we are testing house so I have

651
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:00,839
a question as I understand the single uh

652
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,720
Convention of narcotic drugs is a major

653
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,918
issue for for developing the future

654
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,360
business of cannabis worldwide so and I

655
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,600
understand that two countries in the

656
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,959
world legalize cannabis already like

657
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:15,959
Canada or Uruguay do you have any ISS do

658
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,519
do do you ever heard that there's a

659
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,360
criminal proceedings happens against

660
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:24,519
these countries because they actively uh

661
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:28,038
work against the UN singer

662
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:29,639
convention and uh if Switzerland has

663
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:33,319
these

664
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,720
um TS in the moment and if Switzerland

665
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,639
could be the next country to make it

666
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,399
legalized so it will be Third Country uh

667
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,640
if you legalize it completely like

668
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,639
Canada or Uruguay so you will be the

669
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,679
third country maybe or what I heard

670
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,520
yesterday Czech Republic all in means

671
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,440
also that there more and more countries

672
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,639
going in this direction so would this be

673
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,880
a nice uh open discussion point to

674
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,399
discuss with the authorities worldwide

675
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,480
to think about the uh uh change of the

676
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:07,158
un uh senior Convention of narcotic

677
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,278
drugs anyone wants to answer that one I

678
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,039
mean you're the lawyer yeah so um but

679
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:15,398
well there's there hasn't been any

680
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:17,519
enforcement really um warning letters I

681
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:19,918
think there have been sorry warning

682
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,879
letters warning letters and got a

683
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,320
warning letter also and yeah but warning

684
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,880
letters yeah but un can't find anyone

685
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:30,798
can can't find a country baiting out or

686
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,760
breaking the the UN convention and

687
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,158
warning letters are sweet yeah but as

688
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,558
kashar said before like the bigger risk

689
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,159
here in Europe is to get like fines um

690
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,000
for breaching European law and it's not

691
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,960
necessarily the single convention but

692
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,679
nevertheless it's the law that is

693
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,159
governing many of our processes so um it

694
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:51,640
needs to be it's something that needs to

695
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,240
be changed that may be through

696
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,679
Interstate modification um but again

697
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,000
also these are like these processes take

698
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,720
time um but in best case we should all

699
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,240
keep on lobbying to remove cannabis from

700
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,360
the single convention so the legal

701
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,759
pressure more comes from

702
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:10,079
Brussels and but we can yeah we can

703
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,480
neglect New York but the pressure comes

704
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,439
from from Brussels they can find the

705
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,599
countries they can find them big time

706
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,679
and uh nevertheless there's still some

707
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,719
gaps in interpretation also in scholarly

708
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,038
writings as to how far does the single

709
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,798
convention go is there let's be very

710
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,519
blunt here it's uh two countries who are

711
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:32,158
keeping Us in the single convention in

712
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,038
cannabis China and Russia correct yeah

713
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,520
so as long as that is not changing and

714
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:42,000
as long as there is no movement there so

715
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,000
um that's will be blockage more

716
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,240
questions okay um maybe maybe I can it's

717
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:52,519
oh sorry hi thank you uh with the global

718
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,640
markets opening up uh do you think it's

719
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,440
possible uh that countries signed on to

720
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,559
the UN single convention could be forced

721
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,519
to withdraw from the treaty if the

722
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,038
voters of those respective countries

723
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,960
applied specific political

724
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:09,759
pressure there is various ways on how

725
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,360
you could potentially um circumvent the

726
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,319
problems that you have with the single

727
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,839
convention getting out of the single

728
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,439
convention obviously is very challenging

729
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:20,439
because it does not only affect cannabis

730
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,200
it affects all kinds of uh medicines and

731
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,159
and and medical products so it this is

732
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,919
not really there's been discussions in

733
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,840
Germany maybe getting out of the single

734
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,240
convention and then re-entering after

735
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,959
um with an exception that's a

736
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,960
possibility there's possibilities to do

737
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,840
inter modifications between various

738
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,880
countries but that's a conversation

739
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:41,839
honestly for a whole different panel or

740
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,640
five panels um there are potential

741
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,240
options but they're all very challenging

742
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,880
and the interest to really get out of

743
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,000
the single convention is very low and I

744
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,960
don't think that's a very realistic

745
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,038
scenario it's rather breach it and and

746
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,679
live with the warning letters so maybe I

747
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:00,000
can add a question if there's no more

748
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,960
question um what's about the Bolivian

749
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,398
approach when Bolivia legal they Rel

750
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,000
legalized the Coca plant and they left

751
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,918
the singal convention and re-entered and

752
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,640
that worked out in that case so is that

753
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,640
not that would be would that be a

754
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,360
solution for Germany that's an

755
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,759
interesting question actually Misha

756
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:21,558
because um that's for the traditional

757
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,440
use of cuka yeah and um that is also

758
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:26,398
something that is super interesting for

759
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,038
uh Global n National thread we have some

760
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,359
countries of original origin for

761
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:34,720
traditional cannabis products like for

762
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:37,158
example Moroccan hash yeah so that is a

763
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,919
typical traditional product made of

764
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:42,200
cannabis and uh the cooka regulation

765
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,440
that M mentions they are really for the

766
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,399
traditional um use um in the culture I

767
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,759
would like to answer also I I think it

768
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,879
is a viable potential Avenue because

769
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,759
it's unlikely that if Germany would

770
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,240
really take the step and get out of the

771
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,960
convention that um they wouldn't be let

772
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,839
back in just because they're actually

773
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,440
bracketing out cannabis from from the

774
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:10,839
narcotics uh list thank you if we have

775
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,880
no further questions well I would like

776
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:14,678
to thank the panel for this conversation

777
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,039
could obviously has have been much

778
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,480
longer and we're still around if you

779
