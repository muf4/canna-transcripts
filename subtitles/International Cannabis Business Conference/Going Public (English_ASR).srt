88
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,500

house and we have sort of a unique

95
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,840
component online it's called our bull

96
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:02,370
boards and our bull boards are an

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,259
unmoderated almost chat that our

98
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,299
investors are going to to communicate

99
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,519
with each other again by ticker symbol

100
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,370
to discuss investment opportunities

101
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,739
what's going on with the company etc so

102
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,108
there's a lot of communication every

103
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,788
week we put out our top buzz on the bull

104
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,149
boards and it's basically the most

105
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:22,769
viewed stocks on site which really gives

106
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,439
you an idea of you know what

107
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,418
Nestor's are looking at what companies

108
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,240
they're keen on that sort of thing as

109
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:34,469
well interest on stock has has changed

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,418
significantly in the last 18 months we

111
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,690
have traditionally we've been around for

112
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:42,508
about 25 years and traditionally we were

113
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:45,449
I have a lot of interest in mining and

114
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:47,848
metals in 2018 with cannabis coming on

115
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,908
the same that's completely turned itself

116
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:53,478
around with cannabis tech blockchain

117
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:56,430
that's well over 60 percent of what our

118
00:04:53,478 --> 00:05:01,110
retail investors are looking for and

119
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:04,949
looking at online our top reads again

120
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,710
are significantly in cannabis so we have

121
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,569
a new investor just to give you an idea

122
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,189
of what the landscape is looking at

123
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:14,158
looking like in the retail investment

124
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:16,918
community finally the Millennials have

125
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:18,750
come in to capital markets so you know

126
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,628
18 months ago people were saying oh no

127
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,269
Millennials aren't going to invest in

128
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:25,319
public equity they're not going to look

129
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:27,689
at that there may be looking at

130
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,569
crowdfunding maybe but cannabis has

131
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,889
completely changed that capital markets

132
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,830
they proof the capital markets

133
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,120
completely wrong so we have

134
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:38,310
significantly increased our millennial

135
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,079
investor on site and Millennials are

136
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,300
quick on the uptake so they're looking

137
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,120
for things they can relate to and that's

138
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,569
why cannabis fit the bill for them so

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,959
well

140
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:51,629
so it's a great audience that you can

141
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,028
target to teach them about your company

142
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,259
what you're doing and really get the

143
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:58,978
word out there and amplify your message

144
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:01,830
as far as what makes you unique and as

145
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:04,818
you sort of go look start to look at

146
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:07,019
going public and work down that road

147
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,430
just letting people know what your

148
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,560
milestones are with your company that

149
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,360
you're you're planning on hitting on

150
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,149
that note I'm going to turn it over to

151
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,908
Anna sarin again she's with the Canadian

152
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:20,098
Securities Exchange and she can speak a

153
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:24,319
little bit more about what the CSA does

154
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:24,319
and how they can help take you public

155
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,639

161
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:54,399
get into some information about what it

162
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,519
looks like to go public so hopefully I

163
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,859
don't bore you too much we are based out

164
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,310
of our main operations are in Toronto

165
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm based out of our Vancouver office

166
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,139
and basically what happened is there was

167
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,139
a change in the healthcare program in

168
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,400
Canada and we took the stance as a stock

169
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,290
exchange that we would allow companies

170
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,769
to list with us that we're applying for

171
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,819
their application the other exchanges

172
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,799
decided that you need to already have

173
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,478
your application and the way that the

174
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,270
platform was built out you had to grow

175
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,550
your facility build your facility to get

176
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:29,799
to that place which obviously requires a

177
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,660
large amount of capital and it's very

178
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,759
difficult to go and go find those sons

179
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,490
of capital you can't go into a bank and

180
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,349
borrow the money so the opportunity for

181
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,110
us allowed these companies to come

182
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,400
flooding to us at the same time what

183
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,460
happened as the retail investor

184
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,199
absolutely adored the product so they

185
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:50,560
were willing and happy to invest in the

186
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,339
space so this started around 2014 on the

187
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,769
Canadian side out of the 475 companies

188
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,209
that we host about a hundred and twenty

189
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:02,769
five of them are in the canvas space

190
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:04,359
about 50 of those have u.s. assets the

191
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:07,149
u.s. entrants came in our first

192
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:12,569
application from US company was a golden

193
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,569
leaf holdings and that was in 2015 I

194
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:21,909
love this chart so the CSE is a

195
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:25,689
overnight 15 year success and you can

196
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:28,120
see as we as we checked along you know

197
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:29,500
slowly growing as an exchange what's

198
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,180
happened over the past few years has

199
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,219
very much been driven by the cannabis

200
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:38,408
sector we have 124 cannabis related

201
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,690
issuers that's growing so quickly that

202
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:44,168
this is probably already out of date

203
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:47,230
25 billion enterprise value of cannabis

204
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:49,689
companies and 2.6 billion dollars was

205
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,240
raised in the US cannabis sector in 2018

206
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:58,000
again it's happening so quickly that

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,500
number is probably much more this one's

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,440
really interesting to watch so take a

209
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,259
look at the u.s. one in 2017 and the

210
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,240
numbers that were raised versus 2018 and

211
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:10,778
what we're seeing the trend is is that

212
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,389
the Canadian space although it did quite

213
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:15,610
well we have some issues with our

214
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,919
legalization process so a lot of these

215
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,289
companies although they have huge market

216
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,389
capitalization they don't actually

217
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:24,278
generate a huge amount of revenue and

218
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:25,899
the retail investor is starting to

219
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,490
figure that out

220
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,470
but the US companies and where the

221
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,110
opportunity there is on this side the

222
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,879
border is you have fantastic companies

223
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,579
that actually generate revenue that

224
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,078
actually have assets and so you're

225
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:39,879
seeing a lot of the Canadian companies

226
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,069
in the space start to go into

227
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,778
consolidation mode they have a lot of

228
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,970
capital they don't have a lot of

229
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:47,139
business so they're coming on this side

230
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,209
of the border and they're trying to

231
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:52,089
gobble up as many US assets as they can

232
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:56,169
as well US companies are just coming on

233
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,519
our side of the border to go public this

234
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:01,240
really is starting to become a global

235
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,759
play and my hope is that you know we had

236
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,639
the opportunity over the past few

237
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:09,490
decades to be known across the world in

238
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,250
the jr. space for the resource sector

239
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,870
and mining I'm hoping that we'll be the

240
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,309
next leaders in the cannabis space like

241
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,799
I said there's lots of consolidation

242
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:23,049
that we're starting to see and

243
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,379
consolidation you know really there's

244
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:28,479
just so much ability to raise capital

245
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,889
that people are racing out there the

246
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,659
other thing that I'm starting to see and

247
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,389
it's mainly on this side of the border

248
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:35,860
is at the branding side of things so

249
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,990
everyone's racing to create their band

250
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,028
there's there's obviously a lot of

251
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,620
product that's coming to market so it's

252
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:45,448
really hard to stand out everyone wants

253
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,448
to be the next coca-cola of cannabis

254
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,529
I'll try and go through this part pretty

255
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,879
quickly because it's just technical

256
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,990
information about what you need to go

257
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,909
public

258
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,278
but please do if you if you ever have

259
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:59,379
any questions give any of us a call at

260
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,509
the exchange we'll happily walk you

261
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:03,338
through the nuts and bolts of it you

262
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:06,129
basically need to become a qualifying

263
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,440
sorry qualify as a reporting issuer you

264
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:11,528
have to be an active business have

265
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,250
sufficient public distribution and meet

266
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:18,070
share structure guidelines there's a few

267
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:21,100
different ways that you can do this not

268
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,209
all are the absolute perfect way but for

269
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,830
each unique company

270
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,989
there might be one Avenue that is better

271
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,220
for you than another so make sure that

272
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,019
you're working with the right people who

273
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,629
understand Capital Markets and can guide

274
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:33,220
you down this road so the first route is

275
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,689
obviously the IPO that's probably what

276
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,820
most people understand the initial

277
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,410
public offering and people take this

278
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,510
route and start as a brand new company

279
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:43,629
they'll follow prospectus with our

280
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:45,850
Commission and raise capital at the time

281
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:48,399
they go public also gaining their

282
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,980
shareholders the next route is called an

283
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,080
RTO so this is traditionally for a

284
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,600
company that had an active business it

285
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,430
didn't succeed and they want to create

286
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,339
shareholder value so they're gonna

287
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:02,439
acquire a new asset sometimes this is

288
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,959
the right move for your individual

289
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,810
company but it does have its own

290
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,099
glitches in it so quite often if the

291
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:11,979
company was in an active business

292
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,360
outside of the space you need to do a

293
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,430
change of business you need to get

294
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,209
shareholder approval so there are some

295
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:20,469
added steps to it there's also an on

296
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,879
offering prospectus and that's

297
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,680
essentially for a company that already

298
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:26,169
has their shareholders you need at least

299
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,479
150 you'll already have your working

300
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:30,250
capital so all you're doing is filing a

301
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,070
prospectus with the Commission and going

302
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,708
public typically people will take this

303
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,629
route because the shareholders that come

304
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:41,289
into the private company it provides

305
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:43,059
them with an exit strategy there's

306
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:45,370
something else called shells and I get

307
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,929
this call many times a day we don't have

308
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,149
a shell program and what a shell program

309
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:51,458
is is when somebody builds a company

310
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:54,309
with no intention of putting in a

311
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,869
business they then go and seek out the

312
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,719
business once that's been built to bring

313
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,759
that into it so we don't have a shell

314
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,129
program at the CSC but our listing

315
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,319
requirements are much less less arduous

316
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,350
than other exchanges so there really

317
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,760
isn't any reason

318
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,860
you shouldn't be able to go through the

319
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:15,230
RT or IPO process business requirements

320
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,930
demonstratable Revenue recent history is

321
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:21,050
a listed company aka if you were listed

322
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:23,599
on another exchange minimum working

323
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:25,279
capital and resources to achieve stated

324
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,529
objectives for twelve months following a

325
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,360
listing we don't tell you what you need

326
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,399
you tell us what you need in the next

327
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,639
twelve months as far as your working

328
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,889
capital requirements if you go the IPO

329
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,230
route the one nice feature we have in

330
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,689
our policies is builder shares so as the

331
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,039
founders of these companies we know that

332
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,350
you guys are all very entrepreneurial

333
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,319
and deserve to reap the benefit of

334
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,060
building these companies up you can you

335
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,770
can offer out twenty-five percent of

336
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:57,199
your outstanding shares as builder

337
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:58,669
shares basically a company to be public

338
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,129
it means a hundred and fifty

339
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:03,589
shareholders ten percent of that needs

340
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:05,029
to be free trading I would highly

341
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,550
suggest that you always have more than

342
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:09,259
ten percent you know it's unfortunate

343
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,549
when we see companies stick right to

344
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,620
this and then they go to mark and go

345
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,629
well no one's buying my stock well only

346
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,210
ten percent of people have stock that

347
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:18,529
they can trade so it's really good idea

348
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,670
to make sure that like I said you're

349
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:21,049
working with the right groups of people

350
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:27,169
who are bringing in the right share

351
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:29,959
holders cannabis companies do have some

352
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:34,129
added requirements obviously it's still

353
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,440
not federally legal here so you know the

354
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:38,179
way that we have taken to it is we just

355
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:45,950
want you to disclose all of those risks

356
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:47,209
to your shareholders I think for for an

357
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,610
exchange that has four hundred and

358
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,379
seventy five companies I think we have

359
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,240
about a hundred and seventy in the Q's

360
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:55,039
last number I heard so we're growing

361
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,500
very quickly we see a huge opportunity

362
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:02,179
in the US and especially in the cannabis

363
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,990
sector we're open for business thank you

364
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:10,489
for your time

365
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,490
[Applause]

366
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:19,558
everybody so wanted to briefly chat

367
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,438
about the accounting side not to bore

368
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:24,629
you guys but but we wanted to talk about

369
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:26,669
accounting specifically because a lot of

370
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:29,308
the issuers that are coming north of the

371
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:32,159
border to get to get capitalized one of

372
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:34,528
the big kind of bottlenecks that they

373
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,818
end up you know getting into is not

374
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:38,698
understanding the rules that are

375
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:40,799
required to go public in Canada so we

376
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:42,448
wanted to and one of the main items is

377
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,308
the financial statement side so we

378
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:46,588
wanted to talk briefly about what those

379
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:49,230
rules are because if you prep in advance

380
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,749
it's gonna save you a significant amount

381
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,308
of time as part of it as part of the

382
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:55,199
process and you know from a process

383
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:57,389
perspective you know go public can take

384
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,458
you know two to three months it can take

385
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,799
six to nine months so depending on how

386
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:05,458
prepared you are with the financial

387
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,708
aspects of your ordeal and none of your

388
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:10,018
numbers you're gonna end up on the

389
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:13,888
shorter end of that that that time scale

390
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,360
so the primary requirement if your

391
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,970
company's thinking about going public in

392
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,438
Canada is you need two years of audited

393
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:24,928
financial statements the beauty from a

394
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:28,259
Canadian perspective is if you haven't

395
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:30,749
existed for two years that's okay you

396
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,669
can come in as a new business with less

397
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:33,928
than two years of operations so

398
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:35,490
especially for the companies that are in

399
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:37,619
the cannabis space sometimes they're

400
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,539
newer you know but they have the right

401
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,519
idea and the right team you can actually

402
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,349
go public without having this long

403
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,629
history so if you compare that for

404
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,379
example with the u.s. u.s. usually need

405
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:51,028
to have three years of operational you

406
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,589
know results that you need to report

407
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:54,389
which is not the same in Canada so

408
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,569
that's quite attractive from a new

409
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:00,720
company perspective coming in so again

410
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:02,849
both yours need to be audited there are

411
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,828
a lot of smaller companies that also

412
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,538
choose to go public in Canada because we

413
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:09,720
actually have great venture capital

414
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:12,269
money and so our our public markets in

415
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,360
Canada actually play the role that you

416
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:16,558
guys may be used to from from a venture

417
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,838
capital on of venture capital money is

418
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,028
raised here so not all of the companies

419
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,828
sitting there with you know 50 million

420
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:25,109
in revenue we have smaller companies

421
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:27,629
that do so what the nice thing is that

422
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,579
our exchanges recognize that and so to

423
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,190
provide less burden on those smaller

424
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:34,230
companies you only need one year of

425
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,150
audited financial statements if your

426
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,659
revenue and assets are under 10 million

427
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,370
so that's quite beneficial it eliminates

428
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,900
a lot of cost burden in terms of going

429
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:44,569
public so it's something you should

430
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,590
definitely keep in keep in mind

431
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:48,450
depending on the timing

432
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:51,629
you'll also need interim financial

433
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,308
statements for your latest quarter you

434
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,350
don't need to have those audited they

435
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:57,269
are reviewed which is a lower level down

436
00:17:55,349 --> 00:18:00,389
but again it's a little bit more

437
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:02,129
streamlined and the final financial item

438
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,778
that you'd need that that part as part

439
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,630
of your listing is what's known as a pro

440
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:08,069
forma financial statement so that's you

441
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,419
know we used the word performer but it's

442
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,158
not a projection it's not how the

443
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,899
company is gonna do it's just a

444
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,789
financial statement that effects the

445
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:16,889
transaction to say here's how you're

446
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:18,298
gonna look like as a public company with

447
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,230
all of your shareholders with all of

448
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,839
your financings

449
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,250
and that's not audited or reviewed but

450
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,928
it's something you have to have in the

451
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,890
in the back of your head as part of this

452
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:32,090
process so one key item for the people

453
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,049
in this room so in in Canada we use

454
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:37,470
international financial reporting

455
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:39,269
standards it is different from what you

456
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,308
guys are used to from an American

457
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:42,898
perspective being US GAAP so for the

458
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:44,908
international people in the room then

459
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:48,359
exactly you know what I'm talking about

460
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:51,539
for Americans US GAAP is not permitted

461
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,869
and there can be substantive differences

462
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,220
so if your service providers or you know

463
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:58,229
the people you're working with right now

464
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,778
from a financial perspective are not

465
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:05,250
versed in this it's an area you may want

466
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:06,778
to think about from an auditor

467
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,308
perspective so obvious as a public

468
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:11,730
company you're gonna need an auditor

469
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:15,269
both before and after before you go

470
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:18,058
public you can use a an auditor that's

471
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:20,308
not registered in Canada if your public

472
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:22,558
your auditor has to be registered in

473
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:24,599
Canada and so we work with issuers and

474
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,730
we have partnerships both in Canada and

475
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,469
the US because obviously not everybody

476
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,690
plays in the in the space as

477
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,169
u.s. and certainly in Canada as well

478
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,360
most firms will not touch anything with

479
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,620
us operations

480
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,269
okay well we'll get into a little bit

481
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:43,639
more details as we go but that's sort of

482
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:46,009
the high level great thanks so much for

483
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,809
us alright now that you know a little

484
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:50,029
bit about who we are and how we can help

485
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:52,298
you and what we do let's get into

486
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:55,548
raising capital in the cannabis sector

487
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:58,009
maybe I can start at the end with John

488
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:59,929
and Mark you guys have a lot of

489
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,629
experience in this area what kinds of

490
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:05,000
financings are you seeing in the space

491
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,460
currently what are the company types

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,640
that you're seeing and what straits your

493
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,960
growth are they at and what's really

494
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,030
wetting the retail investors appetite at

495
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,319
this point from your perspective so in

496
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:17,899
the last two years there's approximately

497
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:19,189
six billion raised in cannabis that's a

498
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,019
lot of money that's been sucked out of

499
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,120
the system I don't think we're gonna see

500
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,639
as much this year I think that the money

501
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,408
is looking for maybe more unique

502
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,030
opportunities you really could have

503
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,799
bought anything 18 months ago and made

504
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:32,269
some money without doing as much

505
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,099
research as I think you're gonna have to

506
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:36,440
do now I think the ancillary

507
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:38,449
opportunities are very exciting this

508
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,029
could be anything package and packaging

509
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,380
transportation security distribution

510
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:47,599
insurance banking as it relates it's

511
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,280
it's not gonna be as easy but I think

512
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,529
the opportunities have never been

513
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,908
greater there's 200 plus public

514
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:55,819
companies as I understand right now

515
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:57,590
there aren't 200 phone companies there

516
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,178
aren't 200 beverage companies I think

517
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,399
we're gonna start to see some M&amp;A in the

518
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:04,038
coming years if we're talking about the

519
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,038
cultivators at the end of the day it's a

520
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,480
plant it's a strawberry it's a tomato

521
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,250
margins they're gonna are gonna get

522
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,429
squeezed prices are gonna come down

523
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,619
especially as we open up statewide I

524
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:18,288
think that means more M&amp;A I think you

525
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:21,048
have to have more scale like John Salley

526
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:23,509
said if you can find the louis xiii or

527
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:24,798
the lowest raise or make yourself unique

528
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:28,308
then then you have an opportunity

529
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,168
whether that cottage brewery type type

530
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:31,220
model i think you're okay but tom it's

531
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,288
gonna be about costs with the

532
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,329
cultivators and I think the ancillary

533
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:36,470
businesses are the most exciting for me

534
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:41,898
and that's where I see a lot of the new

535
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:43,038
money flowing so I want to touch and I

536
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:44,028
guess a few things that that John

537
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,528
mentioned

538
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:47,358
because it's you know it's a very

539
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:49,339
interesting time as he mentioned the

540
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:51,199
last 24 months we've seen unprecedented

541
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:53,959
liquidity and you know we'll see if that

542
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,720
continues but I just want to speak a bit

543
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,479
to evaluations and in my previous life

544
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,690
as a banker would always say valuation

545
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:04,009
is an art form and not a science so if

546
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,450
you look at you know we take a look at

547
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:08,058
you know where things are right now a

548
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,729
lot of the u.s. multi-state players are

549
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:13,940
trading at from a valuation standpoint

550
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:15,019
an average of about 6.8 times revenue in

551
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,849
about 22 times

552
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:18,649
EBIT uh which is interesting this

553
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:20,479
morning was was looking at a research

554
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:22,908
report focused around some of the

555
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:25,580
Canadian LPS and maybe this is you know

556
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:26,869
learn from us Canadians on the stage so

557
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,489
if you look at two of the two of the

558
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:31,428
bigger players you know canopy the

559
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:32,989
canopy and Aurora so canopy has about 30

560
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,269
percent market share I think some of the

561
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:37,329
the Canadian LPS will do about a billion

562
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:42,819
dollars in sales between wreckin and

563
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:45,470
medicinal and what's interesting is

564
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:48,528
canopy in Aurora or already reporting

565
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,989
there QT q2 and q3 numbers for 2019 and

566
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:55,548
yes tomates that they will report

567
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:58,940
anywhere from negative 37 to negative 44

568
00:22:55,548 --> 00:23:00,348
million in EBIT ah and that's really you

569
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,899
know as they're ramping up they're

570
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:04,700
incurring all these costs so so my point

571
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:06,918
is is we're seeing private companies

572
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,220
that are looking to raise money their

573
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,109
valuations are being underpinned by

574
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,569
therefore looking you know EBIT de and

575
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:16,579
revenue numbers for 19 and 20 so that

576
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,888
then begs the question as an investor in

577
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:22,388
a nascent industry like this where

578
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:24,439
there's very limited history of

579
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:26,778
operating sometimes you need to take a

580
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,899
step back from the hype because no one

581
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:31,608
has really started to report yet so it's

582
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:35,449
really starting to change I think the

583
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:37,638
way investors are are approaching new

584
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,859
companies and you know we're starting to

585
00:23:37,638 --> 00:23:41,628
feel like it's not enough just to you

586
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:44,089
know put together a sexy presentation

587
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:45,648
and project a hundred million in Eva da

588
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,628
for 19 and that's it because we're

589
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:48,858
starting to see the chickens come you

590
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:51,168
know come home to roost especially in

591
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:53,538
Canada in terms of what to actuality

592
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,720
versus you know what I like to call the

593
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:56,789
formal moment and the high

594
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,029
and as John mentioned there was just

595
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:03,359
just big retail rush no one wanted to

596
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:04,920
miss out on the next tremendous

597
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,799
opportunity and we kind of joked that

598
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,180
you know more unicorns were created in

599
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,069
the cannabis sector in a quarter than

600
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,400
probably here in Silicon Valley in the

601
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:15,869
last two years so you know just to take

602
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,370
a step back I think investors are

603
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:19,099
starting to look more I mean the

604
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:21,269
instrument of choice right now is really

605
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:23,759
convertible debentures and some people

606
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,139
are using caps on valuation to protect

607
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,779
their ounce their upside and downside

608
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,990
but the point I think I'm trying to make

609
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,579
is is as much as there's a lot of

610
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,769
excitement in this industry and I think

611
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,199
it's tremendous what's happening and and

612
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:38,639
the whole value chain has changed and we

613
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,980
think more people need to be looking as

614
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,050
John mentioned on the ancillary services

615
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:48,049
whether it's supply chain and logistics

616
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:48,049
or banking or you know anything else

617
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:53,399
part of us really need to go back to the

618
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,079
fundamentals of these businesses so

619
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,970
that's really what we're seeing right

620
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,970
now

621
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:02,190
great thank you guys I was just gonna

622
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,529
say you know I think obviously there's

623
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,630
just been it's been a big hype and we've

624
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:09,359
seen it going and running for a little

625
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,400
while you know as an investor what I

626
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,740
would start looking at in new companies

627
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,480
coming in is the ability to raise

628
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,849
capital doesn't necessarily mean that

629
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,650
you need to or should so some of these

630
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,669
more tightly held structures might be

631
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,800
something to look at or if you're

632
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,230
looking at going public you don't

633
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,089
necessarily need to raise hundreds of

634
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,620
millions of dollars and dilute out your

635
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:31,470
shareholders that's really hard to

636
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,569
maintain in good and bad markets so I

637
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,200
would definitely take a look at more

638
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:40,379
tightly held structures as an investor

639
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,269
perfect Maroof you have seen a lot of US

640
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,090
companies coming to lists in Canada um

641
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:47,460
can you speak to any major ports of

642
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:50,429
consideration for a US company that is

643
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,850
considering listing on a Canadian

644
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:56,940
exchange sure so I think this is

645
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:58,230
obviously for any company particularly

646
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,120
important as part of a go public

647
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,970
transaction as I indicated your

648
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,799
timelines to go public and can wildly

649
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,630
fluctuate depending on how prepared you

650
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,789
are

651
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,800
going in so some of the stuff we talked

652
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:11,599
about you know you need to know what it

653
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,399
is like to be you know a Canadian public

654
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,649
company you need to have people who

655
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,680
understand you know the international

656
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,900
accounting rules one particular area on

657
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:25,400
the accounting side that is specific to

658
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:27,590
the cannabis industry is in our we're

659
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,970
captured under this agriculture standard

660
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:32,359
that exists in accounting

661
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,700
the key takeaway for this group is we

662
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:36,979
have to fair value the accounting plants

663
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,420
as they grow so it's and it ties in to

664
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,400
some of the discussions that were

665
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,769
happening in the cannabis world for

666
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,740
cultivators you recognize your profit

667
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:48,079
before you sell and it's kind of a weird

668
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,029
rule and there's a lot of like the

669
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,949
judgments and estimates that go into it

670
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,470
that people are wholly unprepared for

671
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,150
and so a big part of that

672
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,680
eBay Dodd that comes in and people are

673
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,380
obviously trying to reconcile it out is

674
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,230
a big sort of non-cash amount that's a

675
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,910
fair value pick up that you that you

676
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,490
basically pick up so you have a

677
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,170
half-grown plant it's 50% well what you

678
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,289
do as you grow is you recognize the

679
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:14,690
profit on that half grown plant before

680
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:17,809
you sell it so it's very confusing to

681
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,730
investors you know it's something that

682
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,379
ultimately has to be reconciled so

683
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,150
that's something that there's a lot of

684
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,670
time and effort that goes into coming up

685
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,110
with that modeling and the securities

686
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,240
commissions are looking at that very

687
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:31,129
closely so that's something you know

688
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,019
from a purely financial standpoint that

689
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,940
you know we need to deal with the other

690
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:38,119
part and this is particularly a u.s.

691
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,309
issue on the tax side for the founders

692
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,889
on the tax side there's there's there's

693
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:46,039
a there's a US IRS issue called

694
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,960
inversion and what that is is when a US

695
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,809
company exits into a different

696
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,500
jurisdiction so a company coming public

697
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,990
into Canada as an example in many cases

698
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,660
the US doesn't recognize that as an exit

699
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:03,049
so they so they consider continue to

700
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,870
consider you as a u.s. entity Canadians

701
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:07,849
now cuz you're a Canadian company expect

702
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:10,339
you to be taxed as a Canadian company

703
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:12,859
and so there's an ability to be there's

704
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:14,599
a potential risk for double taxation so

705
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,149
it's something we structure around and

706
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,500
and you know we we need to but it's

707
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,548
something we need to deal with because

708
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,048
otherwise you're going to be

709
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:24,798
a situation where you potentially have

710
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:27,710
two countries looking at you from a tax

711
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:31,668
revenue perspective so I think that's

712
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:33,710
really the the high level great and

713
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:36,379
maybe you can speak a little bit to what

714
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,119
the benefits are to US companies being

715
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:40,278
is that's where we are to going public

716
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:43,339
on the CSE like what why what is the

717
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:46,128
advantage of a US company listing on

718
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:50,868
your exchange um well I'm their only

719
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:53,959
option firstly I know a you know there's

720
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:55,428
obviously with legislation going on on

721
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,470
this side of the barter border it's

722
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:00,739
really hard to engage in the capital

723
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,569
markets at this moment in time so your

724
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,278
ability to list in Canada I know it's

725
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,528
probably a little foreign to people to

726
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:08,989
think about listing their company on on

727
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:11,148
an exchange in another country but

728
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:14,358
there's been some real huge success for

729
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:16,428
US companies and I think everyone has

730
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:18,019
the desire at some point to grow and

731
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:20,389
move into a senior exchange and that

732
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:22,489
doesn't take their ability away what it

733
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:25,638
does is it lets them start off as a

734
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:27,169
public company on our exchange enjoy the

735
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,729
benefits of being able to raise capital

736
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:31,129
anytime that you need to because you're

737
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,649
set up and giving your investors their

738
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:36,230
exit strategy and anytime you want you

739
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:37,699
can move to the senior exchanges the

740
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,849
other thing about us is we have a very

741
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,440
close relationship with the OTC markets

742
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:43,878
so a lot of our companies that do come

743
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,950
and list with us once you're listed with

744
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:48,858
us were a recognized foreign exchange

745
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,749
with OTC you automatically get your OTC

746
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:53,829
ticker and now it allows your US

747
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:56,839
investors to participate in your stock

748
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:58,519
okay and along those lines maybe John

749
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,398
you can speak to this Heywood securities

750
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,138
is accepting u.s. clients currently so

751
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:06,528
that's a bit of a change in Canada as

752
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:08,118
well maybe you can explain how US

753
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:11,450
investors can actually invest in

754
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:13,428
Canadian public companies absolutely so

755
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,109
it's been very difficult for a u.s.

756
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:18,019
resident to invest in a private

757
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:19,878
placement or prospectus offering most US

758
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:21,429
banks haven't been able to touch it the

759
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:23,509
last two years or so

760
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:26,090
heywood securities through our platform

761
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:27,798
can actually service the u.s. resident

762
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:29,569
who wants to access some of these more

763
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:31,339
lucrative placements when you

764
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:33,189
participate in a private placement or an

765
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:35,138
IPO you'll often get a suite

766
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,389
a sweetener that'll be a warrant it'll

767
00:30:35,138 --> 00:30:39,519
give you potentially 50 100 percent more

768
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:42,758
upside you're really missing out if you

769
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,528
don't get in the deals so to speak we've

770
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,259
seen many in the last year that if you

771
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:48,848
are in the IPO or the the RTO listing

772
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,470
offering they'd open up at very nice

773
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,720
premiums and you really never had a

774
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,608
chance

775
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,759
many of the platforms in the u.s. there

776
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:59,618
they're talking about going live I know

777
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,999
through OTC there are some options but

778
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:03,308
if you want to invest in a Canadian

779
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:05,108
listed company you're better dealing

780
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:07,918
with a Canadian dealer we know how the

781
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:09,898
stocks trade we have more liquidity and

782
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,429
you know it's been a fantastic

783
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:13,808
opportunity for Haywood because what

784
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:15,639
we're seeing is we're seeing so many

785
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:17,319
amazing investors who are investing in

786
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,228
these companies they can't get liquidity

787
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,298
they come to us and these are and this

788
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:23,859
gives me hope that this markets going to

789
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:26,739
continue for a while because I'm dealing

790
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:28,989
with you know X Blackrock guys X Goldman

791
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:30,519
guys have gone and set up family offices

792
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:32,139
to participate in these things and

793
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,909
they're telling me that all their

794
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:35,888
friends on Wall Street they cannot wait

795
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:37,479
to get into cannabis they have handcuffs

796
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:39,278
on they think they're gonna come off

797
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:41,080
this year and I think that really is

798
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,628
exciting because any of us who are

799
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,069
investing now that there truly is a lot

800
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:46,778
more money that wants to come into the

801
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:49,388
sector that can't or hasn't figured it

802
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:53,769
out so that could be the next the next

803
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:55,209
wave for all of us great thank you just

804
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,058
I'm going to throw this out to all of

805
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:02,669
you where do you see the next wave

806
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:05,288
globally in the cannabis sector and

807
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:06,999
Canada is obviously a global leader in

808
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:10,210
the sector so what other opportunities

809
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:12,249
in your perspective do you see coming up

810
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,929
um so I think like when you look at it

811
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:15,879
at a very macro level you know the last

812
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,528
couple of years certainly in Canada us

813
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:19,628
is obviously carved out of some of this

814
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:21,940
discussion just because of the you know

815
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:23,678
the way the regulations are here but in

816
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,019
Canada the last few years it was an arms

817
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,149
race towards cultivation space who can

818
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:31,720
raise the most amount of money and grow

819
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:34,178
the biggest and baddest greenhouse or

820
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,819
cultivation space nobody actually asked

821
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,369
the question is that actually a creative

822
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:41,168
what's your cost you know because nobody

823
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:42,699
was paying attention it was what Mark

824
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:44,710
was saying is people you know we have

825
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,220
this kind of fictitious valuation that

826
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,720
was there

827
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,700
but nobody actually said are these

828
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,039
companies going to be profitable so I

829
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,830
think people are recognizing that you

830
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,039
know cultivation in a place like Canada

831
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:59,649
is maybe not the highest and best use of

832
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,750
resources and so what we're seeing at a

833
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,780
macro level is a lot of these Canadian

834
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,400
companies that are very well-funded

835
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:08,049
cultivation is gonna be commoditized yes

836
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,060
there's gonna be a premium element for

837
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:12,069
the premium brands but most of it is

838
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:15,009
going to be going into extraction gonna

839
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:17,379
be going into you know yield so we don't

840
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:18,670
you don't care you know at the end of

841
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,190
the day what you care about is the cost

842
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,930
and so I think what a lot of the company

843
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,070
the Canadian companies are doing or

844
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,070
other companies that are coming into

845
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:30,549
into Canada worldwide is it's a focus on

846
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:32,859
you know low cost cultivation leading to

847
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:34,839
extraction and then leading to so I

848
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:36,789
think we're gonna see a lot of that

849
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,579
movement happening and I think Canada is

850
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,289
well capitalized either for those

851
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:44,259
companies to come to Canada themselves

852
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:46,389
and become public companies or for the

853
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,700
Canadian you know the big the big guys

854
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,620
to go out and basically security so

855
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,390
we're seeing a lot of Canadian companies

856
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:54,609
going on and securing licenses in low

857
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,520
cost jurisdictions I think Canada will

858
00:33:54,609 --> 00:34:00,609
continue to be the IP and and capital

859
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,950
center we've done we've done that role

860
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:04,719
in other industries like like you know

861
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,789
in mining and oil and gas and it's

862
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,449
almost like it's it's replicating itself

863
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:11,769
in this sector as well I think it's

864
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,239
already starting to happen I mean the

865
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:15,550
next frontier is really in emerging

866
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,859
markets as an example two weeks ago

867
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,720
farmer Cielo out of Kim Colombia listed

868
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,750
that their stock was probably up to two

869
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:24,009
or two or three hundred percent so you

870
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,110
know that's really the opportunity I

871
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,420
think if you look around the world you

872
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:30,970
know sometimes we have a insular view of

873
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:32,710
our own backyard whether it's in Toronto

874
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:35,049
or California but as an example if

875
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,090
you're going to sell Paulo or Mexico

876
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,220
City or Lagos Nigeria you're talking

877
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:41,710
about cities that have 20 million people

878
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:44,589
do you know with 7% GDP growth and this

879
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:46,360
is really the opportunity so you know

880
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,970
whether it's the EU we've seen companies

881
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,570
that have already obtained licenses and

882
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:55,299
in Denmark and Israel wherever the case

883
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,650
may be and and you know we also need to

884
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,170
think about outside of North America

885
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,660
there are other jurisdictions where you

886
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,420
have ideal climates for cultivation all

887
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:07,548
year-round bogota-colombia

888
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,519
outside of Medellin or excuse me

889
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:12,369
medicine so you know I think we really

890
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:14,838
believe I think you know as as

891
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:16,910
valuations maybe start to get frothy in

892
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:18,828
North America we really need to start to

893
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:20,679
look to emerging markets and so ready

894
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:24,528
starting to happen I mean we're seeing

895
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:26,028
transactions in sub-saharan Africa you

896
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:27,380
name it it's it's coming I mean

897
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:30,429
yesterday somebody was talking to me

898
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,869
about Papua New Guinea which is maybe

899
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,798
it's a tricky jurisdiction in the in the

900
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:36,079
middle of nowhere not much

901
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,730
infrastructure but I think if you're you

902
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,410
want to expose yourself to returns you

903
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,269
really need to start looking at at the

904
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:42,920
emerging markets and to your point you

905
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:45,139
know we can argue that maybe the

906
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,559
cultivation play is getting commoditize

907
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:50,480
but if you are an LP here and if you

908
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:54,230
have an export license how do you ship

909
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,059
that product to the EU so hence comes in

910
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,248
the whole supply chain and logistics

911
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,140
piece in the value chain so there's a

912
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:02,118
tremendous opportunity to really invest

913
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:04,038
outside of North America in different

914
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:10,489
parts of that whole cannabis value chain

915
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:11,900
in the emerging markets yeah I think I

916
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:13,909
think what you're gonna see kind of in

917
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,700
the near future I think everyone's

918
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:19,578
really excited to get involved in the

919
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:21,949
recreational space we've all been in the

920
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,380
medicinal side for a few years as this

921
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:25,939
has evolved so I think the companies

922
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,259
that I'm seeing kind of really get a lot

923
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,400
of attention in the market is the

924
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:31,429
companies that are doing the pure

925
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,849
recreational play as well I think you're

926
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:36,288
also as discuss and Mark said the the

927
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:39,079
global stuff is really starting to come

928
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:40,849
to play and I think the people that are

929
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,609
coming to market you know it was we had

930
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:46,190
a downturn in the small cap space that

931
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:49,308
lasts about five years and and a few of

932
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,048
us held on but what was nice about this

933
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:52,519
is really kind of brought and it's been

934
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:54,018
brought up a few times now it's really

935
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:56,838
brought in the next generation of

936
00:36:54,018 --> 00:36:58,429
investor and the next generation of

937
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:00,469
investor has a completely different

938
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:02,358
experience than than we did when we

939
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:04,848
started because they have discount

940
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:06,679
brokerage accounts and they have access

941
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,999
to information that is immediate it's at

942
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:10,710
their fingertips it's right on their

943
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:12,779
phone I mean we we don't realize it's

944
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:15,440
period of time that we've had access

945
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,730
this this immediate to information

946
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,130
definitely would guide people to go and

947
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,599
talk to proper professionals I think

948
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,769
it's going to be tough for investors

949
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,960
we're not quite sure where it's going to

950
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:27,269
go because we don't understand this new

951
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,519
investor that's come to the table and

952
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:33,480
and and they're moving along the markets

953
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,670
as they learn ring definitely okay thank

954
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,710
you very much for all your input and at

955
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,570
this point if we are going to throw it

956
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:43,710
out to you guys yes and please one more

957
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:45,750
time for Cindy broad and the fantastic

958
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,970
panel is very informative does anyone

959
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,980
have a question anyone Bueller right

960
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:52,829
here all right you're good you're quick

961
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,588
with the questions here we go Mike

962
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:57,809
Morgan do you see any company out there

963
00:37:55,588 --> 00:38:05,250
putting together an emerging market

964
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:07,380
index fund let's take that way I mean

965
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,179
we've seen different some companies like

966
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,820
institutional asset managers starting to

967
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:15,329
put together funds but to date have not

968
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,099
seen any money asset manners that are

969
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:22,289
focused strictly on the emerging markets

970
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:24,690
maybe that's you so there's a there are

971
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:27,269
some there is a public company in Canada

972
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:29,280
it's not a fund but it has a focus of

973
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:31,920
just going and security in securing

974
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,510
licenses you know so there's a couple

975
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,159
like that so that's kind of their

976
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,990
business operational mandate but they're

977
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,809
not a fun I think in Canada there are

978
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:42,149
ETFs that are cannabis type ETFs but

979
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:46,409
it's not a emerging market ETF or

980
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:51,500
anything like that of the ETF or the

981
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:57,779
company will you can share it offline oh

982
00:38:51,500 --> 00:39:00,329
soon as I sit down my socks here we go I

983
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:05,880
would like to recommend all the men

984
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:09,500
wearing fancy socks today this is

985
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:13,079
regarding price pressure how do you see

986
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:16,260
the deprives and impossible profit

987
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,838
margins and the curve looked like it

988
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,010
moving forward what are the major

989
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:25,159
drivers and secondly

990
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:28,640
a very other product category at the end

991
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:31,489
of the supply chain that might emerge

992
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:37,009
that half might have impact on that

993
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:39,079
profit pressure the accountant I can

994
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,840
answer the first one and and and the

995
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:46,039
first one and not to be facetious it

996
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:47,358
like every pitch that we hear across

997
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:49,489
this room and I'm sure you guys have

998
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,960
heard every person there's two things

999
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:55,069
they talk about how they're growing

1000
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,889
technique is the best and how they are

1001
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:01,309
the lowest cost producer and they've got

1002
00:39:57,889 --> 00:40:03,949
it figured out so my until we actually

1003
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:06,049
see those results it's it's impossible

1004
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:08,269
it's impossible to say all I can tell

1005
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,660
you is in Canada people are struggling

1006
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:13,670
to get under $1 all-in cost per gram in

1007
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:17,179
the u.s. you know maybe it's a little

1008
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:19,970
bit lower when we see sub-saharan Africa

1009
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:21,500
there are ten cents a gram all in when

1010
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:24,049
we see Columbia there are thirty five

1011
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,000
cents a gram all in so you know where

1012
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,070
your targets are we know the top lines

1013
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,420
right so I don't know where they're

1014
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:31,640
gonna shake out but that's what you're

1015
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,650
competing against I think it's it's real

1016
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,569
early days and my advice to everyone is

1017
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:39,230
bet on the people people who can execute

1018
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:41,150
they have realistic expectations we've

1019
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,070
seen so many of these presentations with

1020
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,960
these hockey stick graphs where they're

1021
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,090
gonna go from 5 million to 20 million to

1022
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,130
200 million in three years and it it's

1023
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,930
just not believable I hope it's all true

1024
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,119
but as Mark said the chickens will come

1025
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:54,829
home to roost these presentations that

1026
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,960
have been used to market and raise

1027
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,130
billions of dollars it's it's gonna be a

1028
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,199
reckoning for some of these companies

1029
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,640
and some of them will execute and I'm

1030
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:04,429
betting on the people who have a track

1031
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,650
record not just in in cannabis space but

1032
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:09,108
as businessmen as people people who've

1033
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,849
gone to the markets and have had success

1034
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:13,429
year over year different industries

1035
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:16,099
that's what you want to look for no

1036
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:18,259
promoters yeah I think one thing I'll

1037
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:20,269
add is I personally and humbly believe

1038
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,090
that you guys have a tremendous

1039
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:25,009
opportunity because one can argue that

1040
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:29,210
regulation in the u.s. kind of made the

1041
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:31,609
junior cop capital markets extinct so

1042
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,869
you know unless my numbers are wrong I

1043
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:33,858
believe I think California is the

1044
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:35,039
equivalent of like the fifth largest

1045
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,769
economy and

1046
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,639
the world so what we see in terms of

1047
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:41,610
difference between the Canadian

1048
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:45,179
companies and the American companies I'm

1049
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:48,420
not being unpatriotic but in the u.s. is

1050
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:50,129
just a history of building bigger brands

1051
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,170
or house of brands and much bigger

1052
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,840
markets and that's a tremendous

1053
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:57,269
advantage for any entrepreneurs in the

1054
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,940
room that want to access Capital in

1055
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:01,289
Canada and list on the CSC I mean shoot

1056
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,170
your former Speaker of the House John

1057
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:05,309
Boehner sits on the board of of acreage

1058
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,470
which raised probably half a billion

1059
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:09,750
dollars and trades on the CSE so there

1060
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:10,819
isn't a better case study I think for

1061
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,559
all of you in the room

1062
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,900
III think the other part of it is and

1063
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,099
this is where the you know like there's

1064
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,220
a big difference between the US and

1065
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,389
non-us globally the US this whole

1066
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:24,569
concept of a vertically integrated

1067
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:27,989
operator where the the farmer is the

1068
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:31,769
retailer and the distributor and the

1069
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:33,779
dispensary that's a very like it doesn't

1070
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:36,630
exist in any other industry in the world

1071
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,720
right the pharmaceutical company that

1072
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:42,119
makes opiates does not grow opium right

1073
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,609
there's not it doesn't it don't start

1074
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:46,409
with poppy seeds and so what so the

1075
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,870
question becomes can you be good at

1076
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:50,219
everything can you be the best retailer

1077
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:53,609
and the best farmer

1078
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:56,189
I mean economic history would suggest

1079
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,960
otherwise but but because of the way and

1080
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,119
Canada was the same because of the way

1081
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,360
the rules were written you had to be

1082
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:06,059
right you have to be you know part of

1083
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,550
the entire process change so Canada

1084
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:10,139
we're already seeing that right micro

1085
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,610
licenses are coming out where you're

1086
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:14,309
gonna specialize you're gonna be

1087
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,260
extraction only right you're gonna buy

1088
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:18,269
your product and you you have no

1089
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,860
interest in cultivation why would you

1090
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:21,690
you're a pharmaceutical extraction

1091
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,789
person what do you know about growing

1092
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,740
cannabis right why would you bother

1093
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:27,869
learning right when somebody's doing it

1094
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:29,879
perfectly and efficiently and so I think

1095
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:32,339
from a product perspective who knows

1096
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,230
what products are gonna come out but the

1097
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:38,280
segment's are absolutely going to

1098
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:40,170
separate us who knows but rest of the

1099
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,840
world it is it is gonna be different

1100
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,059
people doing specialized aspects of the

1101
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,739
value chain

1102
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,119
