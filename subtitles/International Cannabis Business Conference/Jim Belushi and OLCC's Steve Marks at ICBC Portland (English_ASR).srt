1
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:21,349
I am grateful to be here I'm proud to be

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,570
in Oregon and I have gotten to know a

3
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:26,420
lot of people and our next speaker I've

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,649
gotten to know this year pretty well

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,570
he's more than a friend he's an

6
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:35,689
acquaintance okay was it joking you got

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,460
that good I'm so glad I I have been

8
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:41,238
relationship with them because we've

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,878
been discussing it's very difficult to

10
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:45,948
get done there's a lot of little things

11
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,988
going on but we've been discussing an

12
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:52,189
opiate trade program to begin here in

13
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:55,369
the Portland where we can get free

14
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:58,689
marijuana to the veterans people on the

15
00:00:55,369 --> 00:01:02,058
street people who have opiate addictions

16
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:05,268
prescriptions and I know that every

17
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:09,228
farmer and every manufacturer in Oregon

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:12,140
will be glad to donate anything to this

19
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:17,349
program so we've been talking about it

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,430

00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:38,449
isn't really that good or that smart

29
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:43,239
it's really everyone that works so for

30
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:45,890
him I mean these guys are really stars

31
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,269

they make Steve look great

36
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:04,519
but he is doing everything he can to

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,479
make cannabis work in Oregon everything

38
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:10,219
every day finding solutions every day

39
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,469
running into more problems and finding

40
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:17,469
solutions and fighting and not giving up

41
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:20,810
he is our director he is our steward and

42
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:24,189
I'm proud to introduce the director of

43
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,189
the olcc Steve Marsh

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:39,289
thank you and that tacos are gonna be

45
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:43,450
early in the afternoon every time I see

46
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:43,449
him I want to put on sunglasses you know

47
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,949
thank you Jim for that very kind

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,900
introduction you know I came to know

49
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:52,909
Jimmy requested a couple hours of my

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,430
time very earlier this year and he came

51
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:58,759
in and talked to me about his vision for

52
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,939
helping people who are one opioids and

53
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:04,819
addicted and I learned of his passion

54
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:06,139
for that he had some interesting ideas I

55
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,939
explained to him that we probably

56
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,309
weren't going to change a Schedule one

57
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:14,150
drug with another one Schedule one drug

58
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,830
inside our retail facilities but that we

59
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,680
would look at that and work with that

60
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,209
and I appreciate his deep personal

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,300
commitment to this issue and it's

62
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:26,030
obviously very personal and I've

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,019
appreciated his work and look forward to

64
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:35,060
continue to work with you on that

65
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:36,890
Jim Jim acknowledged my staff I want to

66
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,840
point out just a few of the managers and

67
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,569
program people because we've had some

68
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,489
changes some are new I think Jason

69
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,409
Hansen is in the room somewhere he's

70
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,349
doing the medical part of the

71
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,099
inspections and running that Jason stand

72
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,949
up please

73
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:54,829
next to him is Shannon Hoffa dits who is

74
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:59,000
our public safety director so she's in

75
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,560
charge statewide in the back is Anthony

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,990
and I've always said your name a couple

77
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,530
of times last Oski

78
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:10,050
close he is doing packaging and labeling

79
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,669
for us now so he's new to that I know a

80
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,240
lot of you will want to be talking with

81
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:17,729
him and then there's TJ see he who's our

82
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,439
data analyst and you'll meet the others

83
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,090
on the panel but some of the people when

84
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,219
we have others here that support us

85
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,969
every day a lot of new faces we're

86
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,100
growing very fast at OCC so with that

87
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,430
we'll have a panel falling of our staff

88
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,379
experts as Jim Dooley pointed out the

89
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,360
real expertise behind this operation

90
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,000
will be answering some questions about

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,139
the recreational program and about new

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,149
medical inspections so this morning I

93
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,209
want to share with you some ideas and

94
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:50,310
how we can improve the oil CC system now

95
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:53,789
I'm not a policy maker I'm an

96
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,730
administrator but we can't be afraid to

97
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,860
put ideas out there to be publicly

98
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,590
discussed because you know good ideas

99
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,500
and ideas deserve a healthy public

100
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:09,779
debate and discussion and what I want to

101
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:13,439
explore is the question of what we do to

102
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:17,729
move past this remaining clash of values

103
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:20,569
between old regulations and where we are

104
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:23,370
today and the new times in front of us

105
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:25,529
to a point where we can maybe even study

106
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,189
the possibility of an opioid trade

107
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:30,750
program to figure out a research paper

108
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:34,560
framework for allowing and then

109
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,569
evaluating the transition from opioids

110
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,889
to marijuana and the efficacy of that

111
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,699
and the help that it could provide

112
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,800
people's lives I'm not talking about

113
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:46,199
squit switching schedule and drugs at

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,870
our retail but how do we create a

115
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,199
friendlier system for the physician

116
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:55,199
patient relationship and to explore this

117
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,009
possibility without having to go outside

118
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,060
of our system to make that happen so

119
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,000
it's heartening to me that we have

120
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,720
engaged licensees many of you for many

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,870
years and Jim who are in this in this to

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,950
figure that out it's going to help make

123
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:17,028
organs regulated cannabis system open to

124
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:21,688
all organs and that's very very

125
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:25,069
in 2014 when voters passed ballot

126
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:28,919
measure 91 there were a lot of skeptics

127
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:32,039
skeptics maybe even many of you in this

128
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,808
room that question whether olcc was the

129
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,798
right place to regulate cannabis and

130
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:39,749
Oregon by reputation or mythology our

131
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:42,959
agency wasn't well regarded by the

132
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:45,299
cannabis industry but in the three short

133
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,749
years since then we put together a

134
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:50,908
system that now allows consumers to

135
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:53,609
purchase safe cannabis products

136
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:57,238
legitimately produced by our licensees

137
00:06:53,608 --> 00:07:00,738
in a regulated system as system is very

138
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:06,058
imperfect but the progress we've made

139
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:08,878
our arrival at this point is because we

140
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:11,369
listened and consulted and worked with

141
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,028
you and work with this industry which

142
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:19,199
has produced a great range of products

143
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:22,319
exactly what measure 91 envisioned now

144
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,519
we're a regulatory agency I think of us

145
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,278
as a consumer protection agency plus we

146
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,338
have some responsibilities for medical

147
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:37,048
marijuana which means that we need to

148
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:38,459
care about patients and customers now

149
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:40,758
we've been doing the same with the

150
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:44,158
medical marijuana community listening

151
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:48,979
consulting and working where we have

152
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:52,019
oversight and influence and that's the

153
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:55,438
despite the fact of our recent decision

154
00:07:52,019 --> 00:08:00,478
to limit the quantities of flour

155
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:02,519
available to medical patients and I want

156
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,788
to acknowledge that going forward we

157
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,379
have to be more closely or we have to

158
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:10,228
work more closely with the cannabis

159
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,838
Commission before taking action that

160
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:15,449
impacts patients although in this

161
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:18,449
instance I think we were justified in

162
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,369
taking the emergency action because of

163
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:22,679
the serious nature of the abuses and

164
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:26,129
because the problem remained is a

165
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:28,138
systemic weakness in the system and I

166
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:29,670
just point out that there are other

167
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,530
avenues for

168
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,620
patience today we didn't limit

169
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,569
concentrates certainly you can still get

170
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,399
shared flower and there are remaining

171
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,910
dispensaries for people to get their

172
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,649
products there was also some very good

173
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,379
ideas that came forward at the rules

174
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:49,289
Advisory Committee putting in place a

175
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:52,710
monthly aggregated limit if we can

176
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:55,769
manage that and dr. Knox talked about an

177
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,230
A and B medical card that would entitle

178
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,120
people to greater quantities of products

179
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,889
so you're gonna see us work with you to

180
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,330
find a solution in the coming minutes

181
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:08,759
but while Oregon has crafted a set of

182
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,920
rules enabling the cannabis industry to

183
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,319
emerge as a significant force in the

184
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,079
state's legal economy we have an

185
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,900
obligation to or learn ins at all CC to

186
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,259
ensure that product produced in our

187
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:25,909
state does not find its way into illegal

188
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,889
markets and does not cross state lines

189
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:32,100
three years ago our agency's initial

190
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:34,679
focus was to establish a licensee supply

191
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,769
chain this meant that in addition to

192
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,229
licensing brand new cannabis businesses

193
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:43,409
we also needed to facilitate the

194
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:46,230
transfer of medical growers processors

195
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:50,159
and dispensaries into our regulated

196
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,889
system and we've done that which is why

197
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,809
now our focus has shifted to oversight

198
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:57,449
of those two thousand-plus licensees

199
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:58,889
that are in our system you know and

200
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,650
that's been evident through our

201
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,080
compliance activities we've been out

202
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,899
doing minor decoy operations with

203
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:11,009
retailers we've been using the cannabis

204
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:15,750
data tracking system to detect irregular

205
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:18,240
and potentially illegal activities and

206
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,059
we've required outdoor producers to

207
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,190
notify us when there's a harvest now

208
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,899
there's some discussion about that but I

209
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,790
think we made it an easy button that

210
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,039
they can hit the morning of harvest to

211
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:30,779
schedule that so I can report to you

212
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,360
that we're out there an operation good

213
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,759
harvest right now which is a saturation

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,070
inspection effort of all outdoor grows

215
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,379
or outdoor grows that we can do and

216
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,330
that's underway I was down in Southern

217
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,759
Oregon last week

218
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,400
and the results are I think hardening

219
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:50,069
70% of our licensees that are being

220
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,079
inspected have no issues and we should

221
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,270
applaud those folks for meeting that

222
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,050
complicated set of regulatory structures

223
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,049
and doing it well

224
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:04,049
another ere maybe 20% have some

225
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:06,719
challenges they're gonna need some

226
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:09,149
education there will be some violation

227
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,509
some level fines but there's things you

228
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:15,299
can get past and bad another 10% of our

229
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:17,580
licensees may not remain in this

230
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:20,639
business because of their behavior and

231
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:24,780
actions and that's exactly how it should

232
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,610
be so these are preliminary results so

233
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,769
we'll see what the final looks like I

234
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,950
think we're going to be upward of 400

235
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:34,909
500 inspections during the course of

236
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:38,670
crop Tober or harvest season in Oregon

237
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:40,789
but just as when we started the minor

238
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:43,199
decoy problem and then saw

239
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:45,179
correspondingly better results I'm

240
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,150
hoping that we see even better results

241
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,669
as the good harvest operation continues

242
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,500
that's certainly my hope but these are

243
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,360
the kind of steps that we need to take

244
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,549
to make sure that our regulation but our

245
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,399
regulated system isn't so porous that

246
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:02,389
it's predictably leaking product into

247
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,159
the illegal market we owe that to voters

248
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:07,860
elected officials organ ends who place

249
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:11,639
their confidence in us to establish this

250
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,800
new legal cannabis market all our grains

251
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,679
and the industry are getting what they

252
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:21,839
should expect from us that we are doing

253
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:24,029
our job now legal regulated adult youth

254
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,240
system may have only been a pipe dream

255
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:31,439
in earlier generations of growers rooted

256
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,600
in Oregon's storied cannabis history but

257
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,490
their pioneering efforts did pave the

258
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,000
way for the establishment of Oregon's

259
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,159
Medical Marijuana Program and I think

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,379
that we're all aware that the creation

261
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,959
and ascension of the adult youth system

262
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:49,710
has had a tremendously disruptive impact

263
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,530
on the MMP system there were promises

264
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:54,690
made in good faith to not harm the

265
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,839
medical program

266
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,940
establishing the recreational system has

267
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,840
resulted in patients getting separated

268
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,000
from growers and today many medical

269
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,210
marijuana growers are tracked in the

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,120
cannabis tracking system the frameworks

271
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:16,350
supporting the medical marijuana system

272
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,139
is changing not through any fault of

273
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,750
policymakers or advocates but because

274
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:25,990
the rules put in place were put in place

275
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:29,500
at a different time in a different era

276
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:33,250
and they stand in stark contrast to

277
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,830
where we are today now we want to make

278
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,139
sure that the rapid development of the

279
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,240
recreational marijuana marketplace does

280
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,720
not eclipse the needs of medical

281
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,669
patients who truly and legitimately need

282
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,670
access to their cannabis medicine

283
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,920
navigating a course to ensure patient

284
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,200
access requires us to use existing

285
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:02,199
guideposts so that we focus on what

286
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,040
works in practice as what as well as

287
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:08,079
what works in good public policy the

288
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,059
Oregon Medical Marijuana Act has

289
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,429
provided some of our state's physician

290
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:16,179
pathways of to using cannabis to treat

291
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:18,729
individual patients with a range of

292
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:21,699
ailments and illnesses and in doing so

293
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,519
to understand the efficacy of its

294
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,250
medical properties the knowledge

295
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:31,179
generated from charting this application

296
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:34,179
of medical cannabis while untested by

297
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,759
the rigors of medical trials provides

298
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:39,458
guardrails for Oregon to establish

299
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,379
additional safeguards standardizing

300
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,869
doctor-patient relationships where this

301
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:47,980
treatment approach can be more widely

302
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:50,110
considered and understood as the

303
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,450
conventional wisdom around prescribing

304
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,700
cannabis continues to shift to

305
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:58,480
appreciate its medical and palliative

306
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:01,360
effects the occ will work with the

307
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,940
Oregon cannabis Commission as they chart

308
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,550
a course that helps more MDS become

309
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,850
comfortable in prescribing medical

310
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:11,708
cannabis we need to do this because OMA

311
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,639
is 20 years old

312
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:18,879
it's due for a refresh an upgrade that

313
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:21,370
still contains its structure and found

314
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,799
and fundamental foundation of making

315
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,700
sure that patients are able to obtain

316
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:30,669
their medicine two years ago

317
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,120
OMM p dispensaries began migrating in

318
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:35,979
the olcc system as and we work to ensure

319
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,560
that medical grade products were

320
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,690
available within that system today

321
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,458
medical grade marijuana products

322
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,860
represent anywhere between ten to

323
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:48,009
fifteen percent of overall cannabis

324
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,930
sales but patients ability to

325
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,470
consistently obtain medical grade

326
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:55,838
cannabis has been altered by the

327
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,800
realignment of dispensaries becoming

328
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:03,040
olcc retailers the OCC already allows

329
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,039
cannabis delivery but it's restricted to

330
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,769
cities and can

331
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:09,319
locations where the retailers operate

332
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:11,919
for those o MMP card holders who are

333
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,320
infirm or don't live near olcc

334
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:20,448
dispensaries or one of the few remaining

335
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,459
dispensaries in the om NP we need to

336
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:25,659
look at creating a delivery system that

337
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:28,939
works for them just as the traditional

338
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:31,240
practice of medicine utilizes targeted

339
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,040
treatments to combat illness and disease

340
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,399
medical marijuana patients depend on

341
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:40,490
specific strains of products to treat

342
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,980
their ailments and conditions we need to

343
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,289
work with all CC producers to ensure

344
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,659
that their strain development that

345
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,969
focuses on what patients need what

346
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:52,879
delivers positive patient outcomes for

347
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,829
them and others that means ensuring that

348
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,009
producers are able to provide their

349
00:16:54,828 --> 00:17:00,229
craft products to our retailers who can

350
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:02,810
then deliver them into the hands of

351
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,959
medical patients this underscores

352
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:08,779
another gap and oils a gap organs can

353
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,308
help close creating an environment that

354
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:14,959
supports bona fide patient research

355
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:17,449
we're hemmed in by the limitations of

356
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,459
federal law and regulations but again in

357
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:21,769
cooperation with the cannabis Commission

358
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:24,620
we need to examine new ways to fund

359
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:27,918
structure and conduct research about

360
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:30,589
cannabis medical benefits in turn we

361
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,770
need the cannabis commission to provide

362
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:36,769
us the guidelines on patient dosage and

363
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:38,960
supply now these concepts that I've

364
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,900
shared with you are not available under

365
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,630
all cc's system today and many of them

366
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,298
aren't even under our jurisdiction it's

367
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,100
up to policy makers and the industry

368
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:53,000
working together to move from the old

369
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:56,539
delivery model to a new delivery model

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,740
that treats cannabis as medicine as time

371
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:02,690
tested a time-tested medical model

372
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,058
resembling traditional pharmacies that

373
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,669
could differentiate medical needs with

374
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:10,369
appropriate strains and dosing is

375
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:13,929
certainly a commonly understood approach

376
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:17,159
such an approach to dispensing cannabis

377
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,440
medicine would ensure plentiful cannabis

378
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,230
for patients battling debilitating

379
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,440
diseases and illness and sufficient

380
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,950
amounts of cannabis for patients with

381
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,559
minor maladies as dr. Rachel Knox

382
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,630
suggested at our rules advisory

383
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,450
committee meeting perhaps we should have

384
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,700
an A and B medical card that would allow

385
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,970
that distinction to be made at the

386
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,769
retail level so my commitment for our

387
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,980
agency is that we will keep open the

388
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:48,029
avenues for enhanced patient

389
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,309
accessibility as we've become a greater

390
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:53,460
point of contact for patients because of

391
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:56,460
our scale our size and our distribution

392
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,759
channels it's clear that olcc is

393
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,400
statewide we have more retail operations

394
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,680
than Starbucks does in this state now we

395
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,290
have the opportunity to use that to do

396
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,890
the job better and we're going to need

397
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,450
your help

398
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,790
working with cannabis commission the

399
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:15,210
legislature as we work through the

400
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:17,519
ethical and economic and value clashes

401
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,740
that limit our ability to provide the

402
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:24,629
right services to the right patients at

403
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:27,569
the right time whatever is decided we'll

404
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,770
implement it so now's the time to

405
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:34,259
rethink and reimagine our role with the

406
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:37,650
medical marijuana community just as the

407
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:41,759
commercial cannabis community reimagined

408
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:43,740
its role with us three years ago so for

409
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,799
three years from now and three years

410
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,620
from now Oregon is as well known for

411
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,889
being patient friendly as it is for

412
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:55,500
presiding providing consumer access to

413
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,750
quality cannabis in a well regulated

414
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,829
market that's what I think we're all

415
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:10,150
looking for thank you very much in panel

416
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:10,149
[Applause]
