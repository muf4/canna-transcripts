to come to our party tonight about space

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,369
monkey I do not and nothing the industry

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,739
Canada's mystery since 2016 I started

15
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,659
investing in Canada and then invested in

16
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,308
the United States early on in some of

17
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:57,149
the now leading multi-state operating

18
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:59,009
operators own recently I started

19
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,250
shipping some of my investment focus

20
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:05,188
from multi-state cannabis operators to

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,680
brands and one of the companies that I

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,899
invested in is bang and I've gotten to

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,150
know the team more and more I haven't

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,009
thought that often great yeah yeah

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,900
Monica Joel sure like so we've been

26
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,250
invested starting the private equity

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,750
side in a Canadian space since 2011

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,609
you know starters were generalists and

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,140
weren't a lot of the big names very

30
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,009
early on so it's been a good market to

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,570
us

32
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,849
I had a focus in the US for the last

33
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,099
couple of years and now really focus on

34
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,649
the European opportunities here and

35
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:41,219
really narrow down our scope into your

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:45,060
investment ecosystem my name is Henry

37
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,700
Buhl I'm working from framework we

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,700
control a small family office we

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,200
actually have not invested into CBeebies

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,980
and Canales companies yet but the main

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,799
reason why is to look at opportunities

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,670
potential for such companies in the next

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,789
one or two years but I could also make a

44
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:12,800
very short-term investment if there are

45
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:15,680
some interesting use right now here very

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,670
good so you guys see a really diverse

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:26,150
group on the panel the investors

48
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:28,459
basically rooted in Europe Canada in the

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,319
US but all of them investing globally

50
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,490
but um that's where the market is right

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,909
now and all of them touching both

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:42,969
private and other countries so really

53
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:48,740
interesting viewpoints jumping right in

54
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:52,729
as we say in Switzerland some of the

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:56,480
other panelists discussed you believe

56
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:57,679
that exit lens is the Swiss but really

57
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,079
jumping in what are the primary

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:08,930
differences in raising funds right now

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:11,980
this is North America start fuel even

60
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,230
away the order or first ones were

61
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:17,869
immediately backed by our capital and

62
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:19,129
then Canadians but most of our

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,539
experience in the public markets in the

64
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,949
early days was actually selling things

65
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,739
that we killed two publicly traded

66
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:26,629
companies if these difference I see when

67
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,739
you look at like the aim or the next of

68
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,019
some of the markets over here the

69
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,939
barrier to entry and I'm just allergic

70
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,180
wired over here is quite a bit higher

71
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:36,439
than need a finisher or this CC indicate

72
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,830
you might see it for most of the

73
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,180
cannabis companies now so you know

74
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,370
they'll be a lot more questions a lot

75
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:48,650
more diligence you know in requirements

76
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:51,800
just from reporting business plans kind

77
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,890
of basically all the things we should

78
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,840
have in candidates and I think that yeah

79
00:03:53,889 --> 00:04:00,349
yeah essentially more mature from the

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:04,879
gym yeah yeah I think the maturity

81
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:06,919
aspect is very important I think looking

82
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,900
at where the US was a couple of years

83
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,589
ago I've been

84
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:15,670
sir it was a pretty fragmented landscape

85
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,798
and you're quite sure how the business

86
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:21,339
was warm and a lot of the companies

87
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:23,409
raised money we're not very professional

88
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,228
what's become much more professional I

89
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,539
think in Europe looking here looking

90
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:30,129
around there here's a sunset a lot of

91
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:32,019
the operators here are bringing a very

92
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:35,649
high level of professionalism right from

93
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:38,198
the get-go I think that also looking at

94
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:43,029
this market from the US operators

95
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:46,300
perspective and investor perspective we

96
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:48,519
seen on out twice what has happened in

97
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,100
the cannabis industry in Canada and the

98
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:55,990
United States going from some talking

99
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,199
and building that talk building up to a

100
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,240
groundswell of support to an industry

101
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,250
built and I think that looking at the

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,340
air market if there's no question about

103
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,689
the same things that happen here so

104
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,888
investors are going to be looking at

105
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:10,509
this market with a certain degree as

106
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,780
patients and they're also bringing

107
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:16,419
capital that has raked in need in other

108
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:19,478
markets from campus activities so

109
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:22,149
there's a degree of confidence companies

110
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,939
and operator NFS or they have looking at

111
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:27,848
the market here I think it's both very

112
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,740
well for the operators here looking to

113
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:31,839
raise I'm going it looks vertical keeper

114
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,370
partners and also helper and that's the

115
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,209
result of opportunities here

116
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:40,418
thanks could just add that I see the

117
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:41,978
potential of CBD you I know as the 2000

118
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:44,680
estimate of utility where we had the

119
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:46,719
public so right now Europe is still very

120
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,360
premature and if you look at the US

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,770
companies or some interesting CBDs

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,139
companies they start from the seat all

123
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:59,049
the way down to the to the selling of

124
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:02,918
the product and I would rather invest in

125
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:07,288
the US kind of deal where they grow

126
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:11,250
seeds and state I don't want to name any

127
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:16,639
compared to Syria another

128
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,639
some European countries definitely Syria

129
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:25,439
so let me take a quick poll here CDE is

130
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,590
seems to be a hot topic here

131
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:33,029
that's all operators or investors in the

132
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:36,259
sector who here operates a business or

133
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:40,619
invest in a business that is kisi only

134
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:55,319
hands Wow

135
00:06:40,620 --> 00:07:00,199
and CBE only THC and CBD okay very cool

136
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:03,899
so let's segue into a question right now

137
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:09,269
about investing in CBD and so Henry

138
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:12,079
start us off David you've obviously made

139
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:16,859
a not just an investment but you're also

140
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:19,259
putting in additional resources your

141
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:29,939
mind shift means you've essentially cpp

142
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:33,629
I wait here investment bank and others I

143
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:36,959
do CVD to me of one aspect of the

144
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:42,569
cannabis plant I think that the cannabis

145
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:44,509
plant is where the that's the word worth

146
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,918
of the potential ins before this

147
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,379
industry age the whole time in all the

148
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,109
calves annoyed and I think that THC is a

149
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,550
big big part of that but we have to of

150
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,430
course deal with the radio tower

151
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,030
realities and I think that CBD is

152
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:04,500
available now and there is a quicker

153
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:06,478
ready for a pathway to to CBD being

154
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,680
watered available and I think that's

155
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,289
where the market the markets following

156
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,829
that but from a personal perspective I

157
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:18,560
think that there the demand for THC a

158
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:22,279
underestimated as well LAN I'm talking

159
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,129
about necessarily high THC of people

160
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,349
giving zone but there is something to

161
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,750
being home and the afternoon if you're a

162
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,850
housewife and cleaning up the water here

163
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,259
or a house with a husband and have a

164
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,090
little bit of THC can make it

165
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:38,720
interesting right we're not talking

166
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:42,950
about them sell them so I think this

167
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,649
whole plan offers a lot so the type of

168
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,480
personal take on this to ancillary

169
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:51,949
businesses that work synergistically

170
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,639
together and the FarmVille you know

171
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:58,430
rocked our world gave us a much bigger

172
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,939
for instance with but calm instead of

173
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:04,059
delivering in California and then going

174
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,110
and setting up partners and framework in

175
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:09,019
Massachusetts and then doing that in

176
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,649
Florida and the states allow those right

177
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:17,149
amended sort of regulations now we can

178
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:23,500
go ahead and ship CBD next air basically

179
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:27,439
globally it up our addressable market

180
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:31,250
immeasurably so when is over 99% of

181
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,770
people go to our site but calm

182
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,259
I generally can't deliver them and this

183
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,899
unless state live in these parts of

184
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,000
California and so all the sudden it's

185
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:46,100
changed the game there are a lot of

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,299
companies or whom this has happened so

187
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:54,620
again is a professional investor so what

188
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:56,779
do you see CBD as it is a professional

189
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,759
investor rate of it what we focused on

190
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:59,899
the agent downside risk right it's like

191
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,490
if everything goes well we're going to

192
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,230
power

193
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,389
faster but what happens when it doesn't

194
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,339
go well and so you know from a

195
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:09,309
cultivation stamp on the THC

196
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,529
I was never pro cultivation is you have

197
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,569
jurisdictional risk you're limited to

198
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,250
one state and you know if you buy a

199
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,990
license in Washington and look as

200
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,480
pricing margins and you can't do

201
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,759
anything else with that license so you

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,700
know CBD has a whole lot of really

203
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,919
interesting opportunities simply because

204
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,440
you can cultivate it here make a brand

205
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,659
here and then ship it in a whole lot of

206
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,980
different areas so you know our focus is

207
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:34,329
now big things that they'll have that

208
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,610
kind of rich or risk

209
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,310
you know from equipment companies that

210
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,440
manufacture machines to you know we have

211
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:42,879
an ethanol company we want to companies

212
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,160
are difficult or tell us which

213
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,600
manufacturers extraction machines will

214
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,088
make those in Canada or ship them all

215
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,490
over the world so you know that's really

216
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:53,470
very important part of our thesis is

217
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:59,470
just not having that jurisdictional risk

218
00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:01,570
which is exciting you were one of your

219
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,660
big plays as a it's a hardware

220
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,180
manufacturer right to there its

221
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:09,069
extraction equipment what percentage of

222
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:14,199
that equipment do you think is being

223
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:15,579
used inspect CD a huge amount of it I

224
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,509
mean the interesting part for us is we

225
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:21,609
used to buy extraction equipment and you

226
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,799
know we have this machine over here a

227
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,419
different one over there yeah I just

228
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,609
fundamentally believe that if you're

229
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:29,649
investing in brands you need the same

230
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,810
extraction methodology you know there

231
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,458
needs to be consistency of that brand

232
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:35,588
you know when you can who's a Starbucks

233
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,449
or McDonald's it's the same expresso

234
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,910
machine the same cash register those

235
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,470
consistency of that experience you know

236
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,028
if you get a license to brew Budweiser

237
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,350
they don't tell you to just go and buy

238
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:46,539
whatever equipment you want that's

239
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,120
exactly what they need so that it's the

240
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,860
same another market and so you know when

241
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,570
we started Vitalis it was just something

242
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,759
we had a standardized platform for

243
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,028
everything and then we started making

244
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,919
really big equipment and I mean we

245
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:01,870
should oughta make enough for the CBD

246
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,789
more coats but now we're starting to see

247
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,220
you know co2 extraction machines there

248
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:09,528
the whole facility that can do

249
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,750
a little tons a day so you know basket

250
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:16,679
incredible pace it's just a skill some

251
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:20,250
of these facilities of what I think that

252
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,649
speaks to the fact engine CD is just

253
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:27,299
driving one song you wrote it just

254
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:31,438
flat-out is we also run a hardware

255
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:36,899
business where the make bullets pattered

256
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:39,629
tech does have the scale to which right

257
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,389
now our dress will market is rung for

258
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:48,060
that they wouldn't have built those we

259
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:51,028
should those EOT machines without TV so

260
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:53,159
the other interesting thing is what see

261
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:56,278
me he has done is it's rock both saying

262
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,850
that were averse to TC forever ease and

263
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:04,379
regulatory because are the psychoactive

264
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:09,509
work with their model but an investor

265
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:13,170
like Henry and invested broadly

266
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:18,360
different verticals now finds himself in

267
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:22,318
his room because it seemed so very easy

268
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,740
I just want to happen I am from back

269
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:29,429
home medical doctor and I never been

270
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,060
like the toxic part of the THC and now

271
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:36,568
we have the non-toxic product available

272
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:39,149
which can be used in both ways and we

273
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:44,009
already have approached by one of our

274
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:47,100
own energy doing that people who wanted

275
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:50,068
to go or not a volunteer after we've had

276
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,959
this problem to put CBD in the drink and

277
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:54,389
that's how we got away

278
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:57,558
what wait a minute that's interesting so

279
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,558
it's just

280
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,620
[Music]

281
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:15,740
so so we passed it so to me it's a

282
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,730
little hard to it's gotten so big but

283
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,829
it's it's only one component of this

284
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,110
space and generally when we talk about

285
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:27,679
CED just like when we talk about

286
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,709
cannabis it still breaks out to its and

287
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:34,039
hardware's and software is it flowers of

288
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:36,229
cultivation is it packaging right so

289
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,049
right now the question to investors on

290
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:42,019
the panel is never going down what are

291
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:46,338
the types of verticals what products

292
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:50,749
what within the space is right now sort

293
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:54,879
of most demands as best or better

294
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:57,889
oh my perspective nothing is any Brezza

295
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,050
there's so much white space and so on

296
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,058
opportunity and thus of an illegal part

297
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:04,519
after two goes for operators or anybody

298
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:06,259
watching the business there's so much

299
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,959
opportunity all over the place setting

300
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,240
in order to succeed you need to have a

301
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,099
measure of focus and whether it's a

302
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,308
certain area that you're focused in or a

303
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,629
certain market or what any cattle lane

304
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:19,789
because they're just looking for the

305
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:23,120
next opportunity you just won't do is

306
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:26,028
just too much so I mean the way I look

307
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,549
at it is of being I've tried to become

308
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:30,769
an expert in companies that make and

309
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:32,179
sell cannabis products I don't really

310
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,068
look at any of the other ancillary

311
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,628
verticals not that there's not a lot of

312
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:38,838
opportunities here of course they are

313
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:41,480
but I focused in that area and what was

314
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,709
in that particular area at least in the

315
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,438
u.s. I've seen a trend I wrote a white

316
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,568
paper in September of 2018 I spoke about

317
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:53,509
it in Berlin called the green regulatory

318
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:56,058
arbitrage case for investing in u.s.

319
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:59,240
multi-state vertically integrated

320
00:15:56,058 --> 00:16:01,448
cannabis companies and that set out the

321
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,100
history of where I think lovely

322
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:06,438
prohibition were I think legalization is

323
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,379
headed and my thesis were investing and

324
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:11,149
after time multi-stage advence operators

325
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:13,220
I think those are still great investment

326
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:15,909
opportunities in the United States but I

327
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,759
think that brands in the night

328
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:20,829
we're the real real winners are going to

329
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,750
be levantate upwards

330
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,850
some of them are Denzel French but the

331
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,730
reason why illegally my personal

332
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,610
investment focus has turned of brands

333
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:34,450
and why I'm doing bang to help them with

334
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:37,210
global initiatives is because this is a

335
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,780
CPG industry nobody really really cares

336
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:43,540
you know where I was grown our who grows

337
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:47,259
some kind of sores but most people don't

338
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:49,120
and they are buying a proc CPG finished

339
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:53,080
product and they want it I think they

340
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,970
many times from a credible brand bang is

341
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,480
one of the first cannabis companies in

342
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:01,210
the United States found in 2010 the

343
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,000
company has navigated all the challenges

344
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,019
of existing in the US cannabis ministry

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,869
for ten years to go public in the next

346
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:13,209
next couple of weeks and I think if

347
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:16,958
you're looking at and that's one of our

348
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:19,779
Chinese liquor brands that I haven't

349
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,949
have half traction that's good it has a

350
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:27,789
time and I have the potential to become

351
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:31,539
in the case of US national brands or as

352
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:34,539
our missions are to be a global brand so

353
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:38,339
so interesting so cpgs brands

354
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:41,289
manufactures essentially I think

355
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:44,649
anything Joel's got a different strategy

356
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:46,750
and also it should be noted that brands

357
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,060
are right now I think it's it's a little

358
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,730
pretty given Canada

359
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:54,250
so non-existent they've got something

360
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,860
like that one would say yeah but yeah so

361
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,319
what's your sort of you know I mean

362
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:01,449
first and foremost for us as always you

363
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,399
know people you know the management team

364
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,870
is the first thing we look at but

365
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,880
ultimately I mean it you know whether

366
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:08,469
you're looking to make an investment or

367
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,170
or if you're looking to receive

368
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,120
investment I mean look the other side of

369
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,650
just the cash right like what else can

370
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,539
you bring to the table what else does

371
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,330
that company need do they have the right

372
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,159
people to actually execute the strategy

373
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:22,899
you know the early days of Canada it was

374
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,830
like oh we have a license and then the

375
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,900
values would go out

376
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:27,429
I think you know that's come to a

377
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,500
grinding halt now you have to be able to

378
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,160
execute business plan and make that

379
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,900
important stuff of profit you know one

380
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:40,690
of the Canadian companies forgot to do

381
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:43,450
that if I you know for us it's always

382
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,820
about you know what if we're negotiating

383
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,340
a deal and the infrastructure that we

384
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:49,899
already have can really help the company

385
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,000
or investing and our money's not the

386
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,740
same cover right but we can make the

387
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,869
investments we can get the operating

388
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,079
capital but we can also provide them

389
00:18:55,869 --> 00:19:01,239
with you know being our global network

390
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,490
of supply people on the equipment side

391
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,170
if it's another equipment company or you

392
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,420
know if it was a brand if we can

393
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,150
introduce them to our license processors

394
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,310
who all have the same machine right we

395
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,160
can invest in a brand introduce them to

396
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,619
our clients and globally get them into

397
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,930
legal markets with partners who all have

398
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:22,629
the same extraction machine here the

399
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,130
SOPs and that gives the brand an unfair

400
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,380
advantage so it's good for the brand

401
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,000
it's good for our investment and it's

402
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,130
also good for the people who honor our

403
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,630
machines so it's full transparency it

404
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,730
really is a win-win-win

405
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,100
so it makes us a very good partner for

406
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,049
you know our what we call our our

407
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:45,339
ecosystem so that's what we're focused

408
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:49,299
on them to super focus focus I think the

409
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:51,759
overarching we feed off investors there

410
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:55,149
is so much out there that you can't

411
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:59,819
really dive in and understand a space or

412
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:04,720
a bit of a new level you're not trench

413
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:07,089
I would agree one for the two gentleman

414
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,529
said before so I'm just in the learning

415
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:15,000
process I'm very excited of this new

416
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:17,279
or call the CBD investment but I agree

417
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,170
to what everybody has said before so

418
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,079
that hey that I can have he can be

419
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,970
closing smart CVD yeah well not with all

420
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:30,449
the the cash bugs

421
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:33,839
I was definitely the best of all so so

422
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:38,059
that will click on on CED by touching on

423
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:40,769
the regulatory component just because

424
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:44,579
David sitting here has some very

425
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:48,619
interesting color working essentially

426
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:51,869
with with Senate committees look

427
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:54,839
beautifuller so here you see is that

428
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:58,679
will absolutely impact you know the

429
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:00,589
investment landscape right now it's a

430
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,420
big open question what you see him and

431
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:07,829
please also describe the capacity before

432
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,269
so the white paper that I mentioned

433
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:12,389
before which was published on new

434
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:15,269
cannabis ventures was read across the

435
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:17,340
world and also in the US Congress and

436
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:19,740
got me invited to join the US Senate

437
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:22,799
candidate working group and the US House

438
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,410
and this working group so I'm in DC

439
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,269
twice a month of in your two working

440
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,180
groups which are with with our members

441
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:32,730
of their congressional staffers working

442
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,410
on drafting and crafting federal

443
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,120
cannabis legislation and trying to get

444
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,550
more support for it in the US Congress

445
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,519
and we worked through a whole bunch of

446
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:47,099
issues done on a cannabis ion the HTM

447
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:50,369
CBD aside I'm probably speaking from the

448
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:53,009
legalization of cannabis I very much

449
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:55,619
agree with the congressman world record

450
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:58,170
view this morning and the frankly the

451
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:00,269
whole industry worldwide it was a debt

452
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,180
of gratitude to him of the world record

453
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:06,150
our amendment is a single most important

454
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:09,660
piece of cannabis legislation in the

455
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,190
world so uh I think that I agree with

456
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,650
him that it worked with moving forward

457
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,580
quickly in Congress there's a lot a lot

458
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,090
of activity behind the scenes

459
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:21,909
our the state packing act is very likely

460
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:24,429
you're going to have something they'll

461
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,080
have in this summer no that's going to

462
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,910
advance the industry very very

463
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,339
significantly when banks like JP Morgan

464
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,200
bank of America seed bank are banking

465
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:35,679
the industry it's going to become

466
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:40,360
normalized by quickly on the CBD side

467
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:43,299
a recent economy there was a reduction

468
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:45,039
that Mitch McConnell was the second most

469
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,720
powerful person in the United States

470
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,940
after the president the Senate Majority

471
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,069
Leader he was largely responsible for

472
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,700
getting the farm to the past

473
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:58,139
at the end of 2018 at the farm bill hemp

474
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:03,039
from the CSA no longer a drugs now

475
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:05,259
agricultural Mitch McConnell used center

476
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,089
call use a lot of his political capital

477
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:09,640
and a lot of his key supporters in

478
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:11,980
Kentucky I work wishing he got the farm

479
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,140
bill week in place and he got it done a

480
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,900
monumental accomplishment in the skin of

481
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,509
Congress but now the FDA has effectively

482
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,600
put a great sight and said no you can't

483
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:25,869
put seaweed in food and the claim is of

484
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,639
course any to please that can't have it

485
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:28,629
to it you can't market ourselves as a

486
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,730
dietary supplement

487
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,620
so they they've started interested

488
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,259
there's this massive demand and the FDA

489
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:37,059
has stepped in and the Congress I think

490
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,369
is frustrated with that they're not

491
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,039
happy with that and the f getting

492
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:43,479
headaches have things like asthma

493
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,599
indicated that big they want Congress to

494
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,190
legislate some more about em about how

495
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,500
CBD can be active food and I think

496
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,380
Congress has perspective is that no you

497
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,269
FBAR agency charged with doing this and

498
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,810
the messaging that it should take for

499
00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:02,559
years it is unacceptable and the FDA

500
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:05,259
regulates drugs and alcohol which tell

501
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,009
people every day yet are sold every

502
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:11,670
single day

503
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:14,650
it is worse not helpful right at works

504
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:17,289
doing it the oxide and the downside of

505
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,870
it are get the outside versus the upside

506
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:23,109
that the FDA should be able to with him

507
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:25,299
I say six months figure out how this he

508
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:27,909
brought to market in a sensible way with

509
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,710
dosage

510
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,880
patience potentially but we're not

511
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,059
dealing with something that's dangerous

512
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,900
here so a Congress is actively looking

513
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,759
at forcing FDA to move forward quickly

514
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,860
including through appropriations

515
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:46,569
measures and other measures so I think

516
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:51,369
that don't be too pessimistic about the

517
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:53,109
progress of CBD food in food in the

518
00:24:51,369 --> 00:25:03,339
United States I think there's gonna be

519
00:24:53,109 --> 00:25:07,299
harvest they're doing - yeah you know

520
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:09,069
those barriers you know I have created a

521
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,629
ton of opportunity there's certainly

522
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:13,539
things that you have to watch out for

523
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,070
and you know as state by state or you

524
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,309
know the different rules of Switzerland

525
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:21,369
anymore - wherever you know around

526
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:23,019
potencies of CBD to th see you know

527
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:24,789
different allowable limits etc I mean

528
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:27,009
there's great opportunity if you know

529
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,589
how to navigate that you know as soon as

530
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:31,359
safe banking comes in and our bills

531
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:32,740
totally cleared up that's also gonna

532
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,919
bring in a whole lot more competition

533
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,470
both on the capital side but you know

534
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,779
also on the production side so you know

535
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,990
once once there's lending and people can

536
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:45,759
build much bigger farms and get mortgage

537
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,109
rates and you know you're not having to

538
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,670
go out and work as hard as everyone

539
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:51,039
those rivers work the Builder business

540
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,779
is the dam you know there's a lot more

541
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,970
scale a whole lot more production which

542
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:57,220
is gonna drive prices down so there's a

543
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,450
great opportunity right now but you know

544
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,519
you still have to make sure that there's

545
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,950
a there's a plan for the price

546
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:06,069
compression that baby is coming it's a

547
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:11,650
no doubt I'll say it has an operator you

548
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:15,009
know clearly hemming them just more

549
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:19,300
readily access to the big banks as far

550
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:22,690
as funding is one thing but for us you

551
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:24,549
know having a business with 120

552
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,559
employees they're made out of cash

553
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:32,139
weekly is asinine

554
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,879
it's beyond asinine and we have a person

555
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,920
accounts money that's that person's job

556
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,040
and so the efficiencies that are

557
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,940
come from at my perimeter or there is

558
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:46,639
parking and sort of moving the words

559
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,910
yeah they're just it's it's it's rough

560
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,420
operating right now so I think it will

561
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:56,960
smooth things not just with a capital a

562
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,880
man like normalize operations and that's

563
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,980
the crazy thing in California where were

564
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,120
the you know if largest economy in the

565
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:08,660
world were we're the largest and this

566
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:12,169
market in the world and it bank accounts

567
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,210
closed you know so and right now our

568
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:18,670
industry is hiring more than any other

569
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:21,350
industry in the other state no doubt so

570
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:24,550
interesting things and I think in all of

571
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:27,649
them absolutely opportunity lies right

572
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:29,930
so I don't know where we're at but

573
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:33,710
generally this is a panel that elicits

574
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:54,350
tons of questions so I want to go ahead

575
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:57,170
and take it out your banking system my

576
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:59,659
name is Graham you are from marginal

577
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:03,740
density which is like a crypto currency

578
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:07,640
system and Ruby don't wanna pursue an

579
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:11,779
alternative and having a diverse life

580
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:15,650
as a senior companies so I think if we

581
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:18,559
look at a lot obviously because of

582
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:21,200
having necessity and it's sort of an

583
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,319
option I think a lot of folks have taken

584
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,940
the view that you know two negatives

585
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,349
don't make a positive

586
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,269
we're already sort of in a you know

587
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:34,759
difficult industry so now sort of poking

588
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:36,829
the bear a little bit more and saying

589
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:41,150
hey we're gonna use this sort of off the

590
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:43,819
charts method of you know taking in our

591
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:48,500
funds that's why you haven't seen it

592
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:50,528
it's because it's the bigger players

593
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,378
don't think that

594
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:54,579
is a great look for the regulator's

595
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:58,089
right now that will trying to convince

596
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:59,589
to let us bank but you guys have any

597
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:01,449
insight onto that I know what I've been

598
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:03,428
asked that question I mean I've seen all

599
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,739
I'm gonna tell them from pop a green

600
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:07,570
coin a whole bunch of them if so many

601
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:09,848
kinds but you know if someone could

602
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:11,888
bring me a paper that basically like the

603
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,718
KYC side of this like anti-money

604
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:15,758
laundering approval that this would be

605
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:17,950
okay the process cannabis payments that

606
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,139
way I mean all day long it solves a few

607
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,450
throng no one's been able to prove that

608
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:23,368
so you know I'm with you there like two

609
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,450
wrongs don't make a right

610
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:26,949
it's a huge problem that's an

611
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,538
interesting solution but I don't think

612
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,419
it's great right area for me personally

613
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:35,200
any solutions in a book right now but I

614
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:38,139
think that's where a long-term close to

615
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,519
sort of hold it is I think they're

616
00:29:38,138 --> 00:29:44,228
coming in the sunset I think the

617
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,479
blockchain camera in the cannabis

618
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:48,548
industry is interesting I know

619
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:50,580
IBM instead of doing a partnership with

620
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:53,408
a company called wasabi to build

621
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:57,278
watching to cover the entire painting

622
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:59,589
cannabis industry nap and I see Chris

623
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,479
Tillman of cannabis duck I usually stop

624
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:04,450
reading it not because there's anything

625
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:09,249
wrong Grizelda just to the point that he

626
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:11,919
made I think it's too much it will leak

627
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:18,489
too far to take both of these leaks in

628
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:24,159
one in one chop there's gonna be more

629
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:26,409
questions probably have a question let's

630
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:35,080
talk about this opinion you know me like

631
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:38,469
does it work like I mean yes a point

632
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:40,388
where people Calvinists yeah what's the

633
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:47,048
stop the government from shutting down

634
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:49,598
oh you're seriously dying I think that

635
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:51,990
the difference between crypto and

636
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:54,089
cannabis is

637
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:58,710
Devendra campus is very easy to

638
00:30:54,089 --> 00:31:00,839
understand and the demand is proven or

639
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:04,370
are those two things right there are two

640
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,369
things that we don't have a fertile

641
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,629
[Music]

642
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:28,279
earlier money and also the fact that you

643
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:33,389
need right now armored vehicles so

644
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:38,399
actually it's so soon the new on sucks

645
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:40,679
but what's worse is it's a like you're

646
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:45,720
risking lives you know so people will be

647
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:50,160
killed so in Oakland which is a huge

648
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:55,558
animus of in California there are you

649
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:58,890
know the crime is it's is a big issue we

650
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:01,379
had our facility broken into most of our

651
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:05,429
neighbors most big brands in California

652
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:07,230
deal with this and and it's no fun so

653
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:12,019
it's not just about the new since it's

654
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:16,860
about like we are friends and employees

655
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:18,660
like danger that is that you walk into

656
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,389
this but you're in there so security and

657
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:26,009
guns and cameras and all because it's

658
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:28,200
yeah yeah well I mean what do people do

659
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:34,529
little like you didn't lobby the federal

660
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:37,140
government I suppose it is going to

661
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:39,539
resolve that yeah we don't think of this

662
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,000
time next year we're gonna be having the

663
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:44,700
same conversation and that's why I use

664
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,369
companies in the cannabis space that are

665
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,500
I think the closest to this issue that

666
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:51,449
are have been processing payments or

667
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,069
cabbage companies are really ramping

668
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,080
down their operations them in

669
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:57,389
anticipation of having regular banks

670
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,529
gonna go once we had there was a point

671
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,570
earlier

672
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:03,119
one of the questions and talk about

673
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:05,429
biggest differences in the US and Europe

674
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:08,459
and I think that the maturity and the

675
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:10,980
fact that you come out without this sort

676
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,819
of marking obviously their pockets and

677
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,099
you know are slow nine years that's

678
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:20,069
their the cultures there but the

679
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:23,909
businesses is is growing up basically

680
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:25,559
like ground up legal mature and there

681
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,910
were a lot of deals that we looked at in

682
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,889
the US which would have been fantastic

683
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,390
investments but you know for you to jump

684
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,009
on a plane and go and pick up a hockey

685
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,040
bag every month is just not an option

686
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:37,079
right so we had to pass on them but you

687
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,940
know with with I mean the track record

688
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:40,589
that was talking about you know the

689
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,509
European landscape is gonna be very very

690
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:45,329
interesting I mean the borderless nature

691
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:51,539
of these you is very interesting there's

692
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:52,799
so much opportunity here so yeah I was

693
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,629
just going to say that I think that most

694
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,480
another component part from the

695
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:00,270
government to sign Lending Act is also

696
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,019
the aspect of money laundering and how

697
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:06,529
dealing with cash yeah is facilitate

698
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:10,230
some reason well we have you know the

699
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:13,019
funky thing is that someone used funky

700
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:17,398
early that's German word it is like a

701
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:19,789
you know like yeah there's a there's

702
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:22,848
they're different components

703
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:22,849
[Music]

704
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:42,289
so usually the connotations with cash

705
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:44,239
are like hey it's cash and even sock it

706
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,190
away when you're not that's not true

707
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,658
though in our case everything is run

708
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,898
through tractor trades and through our

709
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,760
books so all the benefits of cash money

710
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:54,679
are not there in this industry it's

711
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,460
literally just a nuance of hearing

712
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:01,280
bags with you places and to pay

713
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,280
the you know to pay our taxes those bags

714
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,430
ash you know our excise taxes you know

715
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,160
hundreds of thousands of dollars so we

716
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:11,690
need to make one more point about the

717
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:14,779
deployment from from before

718
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,429
yeah the FDA looks at companies I might

719
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,300
look at this more closely and I think

720
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:19,519
for sure

721
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,670
the same thing will happen in Europe the

722
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:25,099
company that will won't be targets for

723
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,980
the FDA and will succeed in the industry

724
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:32,029
are ones that follow meticulous QA of

725
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:35,719
standards and have detailed labels and

726
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,180
not only odds cross some T's of follow

727
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:42,289
all the rules rules to to a TEM you USAF

728
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:44,389
GRS notifications and various ways drug

729
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:46,099
and you you have probably Eagles not

730
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:48,440
script curriculum processor to

731
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:51,170
regulation around food safety so I would

732
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,829
encourage anyone in the state's looking

733
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:57,559
at the food category book just in

734
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:59,929
general to become CBD they think

735
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,929
technology and all of the rest of being

736
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:04,460
meticulous about all the things that you

737
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:08,119
think we should be meticulous about

738
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,470
because it'll be to your advantage as

739
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,880
industry becomes more and more regulated

740
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:16,159
we just say what one thing to that point

741
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,170
home I think that what we're seeing

742
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,000
we've seen it in Canada with the company

743
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,130
like products but what we've seen in the

744
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,079
US with other companies companies that

745
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,720
are able to navigate this regulatory

746
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,809
landscape and comply with it are the

747
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,219
ones that succeed and otherwise you just

748
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:34,070
anticipate for Nia and over and over

749
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:36,049
again so it is important to be very you

750
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:39,110
know to into that a company like ours

751
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:41,070
has done this for decades already very

752
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:45,130
well huge

753
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,840
in all this but we see here's a

754
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,660
question what did you need to do to be

755
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,960
able to stomach invest in your company

756
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:55,329
that right now is you know has all these

757
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,210
sort of regulatory issues you're the guy

758
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:00,880
that liked CPG so these are all land

759
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:03,340
touch what was that process like well

760
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,559
III think that if you look at any

761
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,809
investment right any investment is a

762
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,400
balance of risk versus reward

763
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:12,039
all right website here's risk the other

764
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,139
side here's reward I'm the the reward

765
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:17,349
side of this of this industry and

766
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:18,969
cannabis cooking cannabis products is no

767
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:21,099
moral here in this room because we know

768
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,849
that the demand for this product is

769
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:24,069
massive

770
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,989
it's underreported it's going to be

771
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,539
tremendous when it's right regular

772
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:30,939
normal wing pot so you look at that the

773
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:34,179
reward is known on the rich side I think

774
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,820
bill illegality is what the risk is and

775
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:39,099
it's not in my view our real risk and

776
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,039
it's just a question of time there's no

777
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:43,569
question the us worldly wealth

778
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,250
decriminalized reschedule legalized and

779
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,559
as I said earlier there's no watch thing

780
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,820
about and in my view there's no question

781
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,670
about it in Germany and Switzerland

782
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,620
inflicted like that too as once we do it

783
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,659
the single convention will have to be

784
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:58,809
revised and we're the ones who call it

785
00:37:55,659 --> 00:38:01,690
business so when we dig ourselves out of

786
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,980
the mess that prohibition has been the

787
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,519
rest of the world I think will follow

788
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,769
suit over time so I think that the the

789
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:12,130
perceived risk of investing in cannabis

790
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:15,070
products is much it is large but it's

791
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,599
not an actual risk and that was the

792
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,370
title of my white paper the greening

793
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,099
where the other Tory Arbitron hazardous

794
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:24,009
it it's an arbitrage is a mismatch in

795
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:25,989
value because of this artificial fair

796
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,690
that's been created hemisphere is where

797
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:30,129
there's lots of money that you need we

798
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,809
didn't run out of time but this is a few

799
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,820
really artificial people go to jail

800
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,989
people Chris well there hasn't been

801
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,990
already and

802
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:39,009
since 2016 on it although I don't

803
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:41,649
anything

804
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,540
Annabeth's top producing companies the

805
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,610
reason for that is because even though

806
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:49,300
individual I mean maybe not a federal

807
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:51,039
rate but there's still space already

808
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,869
they're either gonna federal grade or a

809
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,849
seizure on a cannabis company since the

810
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:56,410
end of 2016 anyone knows of an instance

811
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,059
we probably have the federal that

812
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,759
they're definitely interested ring so

813
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:03,759
look I think the point being here is I

814
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,540
think you went in and you assessed and

815
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,750
the risk relative the reward and clearly

816
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:13,090
you make me consider I'm an investor I'm

817
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,639
you know if they invested a lot of my

818
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,590
own money into my businesses and we saw

819
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:21,129
the same thing so please don't see me as

820
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:23,470
a complainer about bags of cash I'm just

821
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:27,550
talking about that as it's a nuanced and

822
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:29,589
