so this will welcome you all come from

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,680
industry let us start with the position

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,799
what do we have now in Industry what are

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,860
your stories what are your products how

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,400
do you see your specific

31
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:36,060
maybe with you Luca fryer so I've

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,939
entered the industry early 2014 with a

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,240
product that was meant for dispensing

34
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:45,059
cannabis resin precise dispenser that

35
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,839
led to a different uh so that led that

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,640
evolved to a project in Macedonia where

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,100
we where we have a license to grow

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,700
medical cannabis that led to the project

39
00:01:53,099 --> 00:02:00,599
in Slovenia which involved the purchase

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,180
of a GMP facility in Copper and that

41
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,339
later led to

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,719
public offering on the on the UK stock

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,618
market

44
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:14,699
that later left led to Manitou which is

45
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:17,639
the company I founded in 2019

46
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:21,479
and is now operating mostly in the space

47
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,919
of let's say Everyday Use cannabis so

48
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,780
you can some people would call it

49
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,059
recreational Cannabis some people would

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,560
call it CBD cannabis some people would

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,780
call it

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,280
cannabis

53
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,219
a whole cannabis let's say product from

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,259
A to Z so which is your annual turnover

55
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,259
is it a profitable business

56
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,479
it's a profitable business yes after

57
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,859
many years of struggling in the industry

58
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,459
in this this is actually profitable

59
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,280
and

60
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,640
the turnover annual we'll see like last

61
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,400
year was good this year is better

62
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,859
regarding the legislation as we heard do

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,680
the legislators need some

64
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,800
monetary push or what should we say not

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,379
it's not corruption but maybe some

66
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,879
some push from the from the industry

67
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:17,340
maybe some offerings of some bonuses

68
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:21,439
that's what we heard on the former

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,439
Roundtable former panel

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:30,120
yeah do you need to Lobby

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,400
and finance the I believe lobbying yes

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,560
I've seen it have I've seen it done in

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,539
the states I've seen it done in

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,060
different jurisdictions like Czech

75
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,459
Republic where we're also moving part of

76
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,098
our production

77
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,598
um lobbying definitely helps with the

78
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,699
politicians but in Slovenia you don't

79
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,859
need to lobby with politicians they're

80
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,018
actually very willing to make changes

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,580
but unfortunately I think they don't

82
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:59,099
have the

83
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:01,019
the power to to beat the the let's say

84
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,639
the

85
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,219
bureaucracy

86
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,738
okay bureaucracy is an obstacle Pietra

87
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:11,060
marinco founder and owner of Pharma G

88
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,000
nabia what is your product

89
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,199
ah we are we started six years six seven

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,279
years ago

91
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,139
and uh we are we are creating I'm saying

92
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,258
creating because it's a process of

93
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,060
creating things and I love to to wrap it

94
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,879
like that

95
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,699
um we're creating a bit of different uh

96
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:36,240
kind of products with also hemp extract

97
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:40,160
and also other Botanical extracts we do

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,699
skin care cosmetics and food supplements

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,280
and

100
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,460
um we have a quite a big range of

101
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:51,000
different products that we have to offer

102
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:54,478
to our customers so do you think that

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,120
the potential cannabis industry should

104
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:00,560
be Unleashed in Slovenia are we too

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,418
close do we need some whatever

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,978
legislation change what do we need what

107
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:08,579
do you need personally

108
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:11,579
I think the Cannabis stigma is getting

109
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,680
Unleashed finally I think because of

110
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,560
events like this talking about this in

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,540
media it's showing a lot in media in

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,699
these days and

113
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,600
um I think that's really necessary for

114
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:27,960
the not only the business part but also

115
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,400
the healing part of the the plant to

116
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:36,359
proceed also to educate

117
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:39,179
also politicians and medical doctors and

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,460
staff that works with this kind of

119
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,280
things

120
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,899
from my opinion Slovenia is really open

121
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,819
for this

122
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,319
kind of

123
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:55,918
solutions that cannabis has to offer

124
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:58,199
but I would really be happy to see the

125
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,659
regulation that comes within this

126
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,919
because on the market we we can find a

127
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,860
lot of things that shouldn't be there

128
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,538
not only with cannabis it's the same

129
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,160
with other ingredients that show up in

130
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:13,800
cosmetics and food supplements and so on

131
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,479
which shouldn't be there and are toxic

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,660
and so on

133
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:20,579
um and it's

134
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,080
ironically the Cannabis is always in

135
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,639
front of the

136
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,279
um

137
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,120
to be on the stand where they talk about

138
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:33,239
toxicity but from what I've learned now

139
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,620
when we are we're in this six years that

140
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,439
we are doing this

141
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,439
a lot of ingredients should be on the

142
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,038
list before cannabis because they are so

143
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,660
so many hormonal disruptors so many

144
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,538
cancerous ingredients that are in our

145
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,880
everyday soaps and products that we use

146
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,879
every day that should be really banned

147
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,819
not the Cannabis that can only help why

148
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,899
is that so

149
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:03,780
well uh

150
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,779
it's not for me to say probably but

151
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,840
Pharma industry is one of the things

152
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:15,000
that probably is stopping the the

153
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:17,939
business to to grow and also cosmetic

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,139
business is is really really hard and

155
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,160
really

156
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,120
um

157
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,720
profitable and everything goes at the

158
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,199
end it's all about the profit so uh

159
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,319
cosmetic Industries are using products

160
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,840
are using ingredients that are the

161
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,139
cheapest because they can and it's

162
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:43,918
allowed to and

163
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,560
doing harmful things to to people that

164
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,779
are using that is not even a question

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,060
because it doesn't bring a profit it's

166
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,859
really expensive to do this so we've

167
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,720
experienced it so your products are in

168
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,879
the field of cosmetics and you are

169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,280
actually taking some market share from

170
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,620
the Cosmetic industry well you're

171
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,478
attacking yeah we're not taking the big

172
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,579
market share from the Cosmetic business

173
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:12,360
but we we narrowed down to be a niche in

174
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:15,779
Niche so if I can if I can say that

175
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,598
because we are Niche using cannabis

176
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:21,478
which is not that common and we are also

177
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:25,019
Niche for using for for doing clean

178
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:28,978
products and non-toxic in any way so we

179
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:32,278
every ingredient that we use is tested

180
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:36,299
we don't use any hormonal disruptors no

181
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,019
our products don't use ingredients that

182
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,379
um

183
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,819
cause allergies and so on so what's your

184
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,458
annual turn around

185
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,460
uh it's hard to say because I'm not

186
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,559
looking for it as annual turn turnover

187
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,620
[Music]

188
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:55,979
um when I started this company I started

189
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,940
it with a long-term goal and we're not

190
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,860
there yet I have to admit that but I'm

191
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,740
still positive and thinking that we can

192
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,060
come to the the goal that we

193
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,459
put in on the table six years ago and

194
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:13,639
hopefully think about this okay we will

195
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:17,399
talk about obstacles later but uh

196
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:20,100
primosaurus what is your success story

197
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,659
um well I can correlate a little bit

198
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:28,139
with my colleagues before uh because

199
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:31,319
my mission is to make people's living

200
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,360
and working environment better but we

201
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,000
are let's say we're looking from a

202
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,700
perspective of the whole plant we use

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,860
the straw that means basically we use

204
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,778
fibers and we are working in the field

205
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,919
of building industry

206
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:48,778
so we are offering to our clients whole

207
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:52,139
hamburger based Building Solutions means

208
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:55,919
a house is made of which made of natural

209
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:59,458
materials leading uh insulating with

210
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:02,449
hemp Crete and hemp insulation

211
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,759
so we want we also want to

212
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,920
[Music]

213
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:08,539
um

214
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:11,759
like flower part we also want to make a

215
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:14,278
better Want to Make a Better Health for

216
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,559
a people because if you take a look from

217
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:20,720
this perspective that we leave that we

218
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:24,659
spent our lifetime 70 percent in indoor

219
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,820
basically uh so there is a opposite of

220
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,939
that so we have a building industry

221
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,700
which promotes materials that could be

222
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,120
probably cheaper because of the economy

223
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,879
of scale now uh but there are very

224
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,360
harmful for the people living in it and

225
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:45,059
for the environment we can see from the

226
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,278
construction site we can see from the

227
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,939
let's say from the perspective of life

228
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,159
cycle assessment

229
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,100
that which waste construction waste is a

230
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,319
big problem nowadays

231
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,899
and we have to use because of this

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,440
multi-purpose plant we have to use it

233
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:08,659
all so it's crucial that we connect to

234
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:13,200
each other and we start systematically

235
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:16,620
approach to to legislation because also

236
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,180
in our building industry the current

237
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,720
regulatives

238
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:23,000
are more let's say

239
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,399
um

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,639
more on a more more connected to let's

241
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,259
say materials that are currently uh in a

242
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:36,299
mass building industry production so

243
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,338
natural materials work differently like

244
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,338
cannabis Works different differently

245
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,640
also houses made with natural materials

246
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,140
work differently so

247
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,559
our vision is

248
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:53,659
the that that we spread as much as

249
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:56,159
possible our business model and to help

250
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:58,199
establish the industry which is needed

251
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,259
so a bio industry is the base of

252
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,600
everything since industrial cannabis is

253
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:08,278
allowed in Slovenia do you have any

254
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,579
proposals for any legislative changes

255
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,799
Industrial Hemp is is we have no

256
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:16,500
problems with that but we don't have

257
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,639
resources let's say quality resources of

258
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:23,519
fibers in Slovenia

259
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:27,838
legislative is it's different area

260
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,459
because building industry parameters are

261
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,880
very very strict

262
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:36,979
but they don't have established

263
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:39,958
processes to be to create some kind of

264
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,459
regulatives for natural materials like

265
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,179
hemp Etc

266
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:48,539
so this is a gap how to prepare the base

267
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:51,359
for the building with hemp

268
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,838
Luca fryer the pharmaceutical industry

269
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,300
did find some niche in this field

270
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,980
regarding synthetical cannabinoids so

271
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,979
what do they mean on the market

272
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:16,199
a form of THC that you can get in

273
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,958
pharmacies which is uh synthetically

274
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,320
processed CBD to get a pure substance

275
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,838
which is then Delta 9 THC

276
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,839
um there is also I mean this is

277
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,399
something that's okay in the in the in

278
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,459
the farmers in the pharmaceutical

279
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,860
industry but we're seeing now on the

280
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:39,119
market in the Europe there's a big let's

281
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,579
say impact or a big

282
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,799
massive turnover is going is happening

283
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,739
on the market of also synthetic

284
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,139
cannabinoids which are substitutes for

285
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,240
THC

286
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:54,959
they also derive from

287
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,940
from CBD most of them and the government

288
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,219
started pretty much

289
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,700
[Music]

290
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,940
not regulating them but Banning them you

291
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,820
know and then opposed to Czech Republic

292
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,800
which actually decided to regulate them

293
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,639
because these are the only cannabinoids

294
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,199
that I mean these cannabinoids are not

295
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,360
considered and are not listed in the

296
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,320
treaty the United Nations treaty so

297
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,379
Czech Republic saw an opportunity to

298
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,360
regulate these cannabinoids and and

299
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,740
they're actually working extensively on

300
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,759
that

301
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,339
um preparing guidelines so producers can

302
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,519
now actually legally sell and produce

303
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:42,060
this synthetic cannabinoids the

304
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,799
framework will will entail from from the

305
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,399
standards you need to meet in order to

306
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,778
be able to get certified and registered

307
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,698
and then there will be also ruled

308
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:52,439
supplied on how to distribute these

309
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:55,740
products how to sell and who can sell

310
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,160
them and what the dosages are and so on

311
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,480
and so on so certain countries

312
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,120
specifically in this case Czech Republic

313
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,459
is really doing

314
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,500
step forward

315
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:10,078
compared to countries like for instance

316
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,078
Austria which was the first one to ban

317
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,799
synthetic cannabinoids

318
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,138
and

319
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:19,439
it's really there's a pattern you can

320
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:22,860
see in all the countries that have

321
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,699
strong THC Lobby so Austria being the

322
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,159
largest producer of THC clones basically

323
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:32,219
they Supply whole Europe with

324
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,899
clones that are that eventually end on

325
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,720
the black market the product saying on

326
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,480
the black market plus they Supply most

327
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,639
of the legal cannabis companies with

328
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,379
these clones like Macedonia for instance

329
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,919
Imports millions of these clones from

330
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,838
Austria this is a country where THC

331
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,419
companies or companies involved in this

332
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,940
THC business actually lobbied against

333
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:57,479
synthetic cannabinoids

334
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,519
and they achieved this this listing very

335
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,079
quickly

336
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,940
not very efficiently also because they

337
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:06,659
were rushing into it so they didn't

338
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,519
manage to to get all of them listed

339
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,458
and there's no loopholes you know people

340
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,120
still find ways and and molecules that

341
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:17,939
they can use and sell and so on so my

342
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,639
opinion here prohibition is it's again

343
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,680
not the right way to go regulation

344
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,899
should be the way that this thing should

345
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,399
go forward

346
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,259
um and that's

347
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,759
maybe on the but what happens if

348
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:34,379
Slovenia decides for prohibition

349
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,720
right now nothing is prohibited in

350
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:40,139
Slovenia so all this is

351
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,980
yeah according to the to the

352
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:46,079
it's a opinion from the ministry these

353
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,360
cannabinoids are not illegal they're

354
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,338
illegal to sell as chemicals or

355
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,560
fragrance products and so on for

356
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,940
instance

357
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,638
but they're actually considering I mean

358
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,940
we've we've we've had the the

359
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,299
unfortunate we're in an unfortunate

360
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:06,838
situation where

361
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:09,838
Customs so Ministry of finances Customs

362
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:11,039
are seizing the packages because they

363
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:15,838
don't know what it is they don't know

364
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:18,659
how to treat it and they have no no

365
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,159
no response to our requests to let us

366
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,259
know what's going on with the packages

367
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,240
these are the packages that come to us

368
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,599
from the from our customers so we just

369
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,919
do service in this business area

370
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,319
and

371
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,480
and it's impossible to get to to a

372
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,639
situation to a resolution of such

373
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,380
situation because nobody really knows

374
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,538
what's going on it's

375
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,919
it's legal is it not so Ministry thinks

376
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:45,240
it's not illegal the ministry of so the

377
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,660
customs

378
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,519
officers think different obviously but

379
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,860
they don't communicate it so in this

380
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:56,160
space there is a lot of

381
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:58,439
unknown and therefore the regulating

382
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,360
these things would be would make a lot

383
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,519
of sense okay so this is one of the

384
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,558
reasons that you decided to move your

385
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,359
company to Czech Republic

386
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,160
no we're just moving a part of the

387
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,219
company so the part that has to do with

388
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,860
the service of uh of that we do for

389
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,538
these customers so that part of the

390
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:19,319
production is moving to Czech Republic

391
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:21,419
and the remainder so the the products

392
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,639
the Branded products what we release on

393
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,620
the market is still gonna stay in

394
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,460
Slovenia Ljubljana

395
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:31,259
so uh Pedro marinko could we say that

396
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,620
there is a Chaos on the legislative

397
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:37,259
field and what does that mean

398
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,859
I would say that it is

399
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:42,679
um what surprised me when we started was

400
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:45,538
that actually

401
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,419
cosmetic industry is more regulated than

402
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:51,720
food supplements which is kind of ironic

403
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:56,220
because you put stuff into you and can

404
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,380
harm you and for example we have a lot

405
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,160
of products on the market that come from

406
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,679
China with Unknown Origin with unknown

407
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,220
ingredients inside with that have

408
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,460
nothing to do with what they are

409
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:13,558
saying that's inside which is a really

410
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,940
bad thing for all the industry that is

411
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:21,298
uh doing this

412
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,640
but I think that

413
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:27,599
right regulation

414
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,840
should be one thing that Slovenia could

415
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:34,740
lead on maybe in also in Europe and to

416
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:36,798
be a an example of a good practice

417
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,798
um

418
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:43,919
we've dealt with a lot of different

419
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,160
um for example a lot of customers come

420
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,460
into our shop that we have in Ljubljana

421
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,340
and they come with uh with

422
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:56,220
drops that they bought somewhere on the

423
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,500
black market or with someone else and

424
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,419
say how is this different than your

425
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,419
product you know it

426
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:06,360
I cannot say about anybody how how the

427
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:09,600
things are different but if we regulate

428
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:12,779
it and make rules okay you cannot you

429
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,519
have to have cannabinoid levels checked

430
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,558
for every batch which is really

431
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,179
important for a person that uses

432
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:22,259
cannabinoids as

433
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:25,140
healing addition or or cream or

434
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:28,859
something else I think it would be

435
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,740
easier also for customers to to get

436
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,859
really good products

437
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:38,099
can we learn something from your story

438
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:40,399
your in the market for several years I

439
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:43,319
suppose so how did you actually

440
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,179
introduce your product regarding that

441
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:49,798
you are in a civil engineering business

442
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:52,340
building houses was that easier

443
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:56,700
far from that

444
00:20:52,339 --> 00:21:00,720
we struggled quite many years to I think

445
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,480
the biggest problem is to gain

446
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,720
trust in the in new materials and new

447
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,160
approaches from customers

448
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:14,100
because they're there there was a few

449
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:18,120
scientific evidence about advantages

450
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:21,119
of the materials itself and the the

451
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,339
materials itself if I compare to

452
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,459
existing regulations they are only

453
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:29,699
focused on few parameters or maybe one

454
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:34,440
if we are talking about Energy

455
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:37,500
Efficiency of the buildings Etc but Camp

456
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,700
materials in building in the building

457
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:45,000
have many more advantages than than the

458
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,519
existing let's say synthetic materials

459
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,019
which are not taking into consideration

460
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,220
of

461
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:57,679
um when doing the researches and Etc so

462
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:00,419
the biggest struggle was to to convince

463
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,240
customers that are many more advantages

464
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:05,820
living in that kind of a building made

465
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,380
with hemp hemp create hemp insulation

466
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:08,279
Etc

467
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,059
um

468
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:14,899
but

469
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:14,899
gaining going deep deep

470
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:23,480
through years we we get we get many more

471
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:27,418
uh evidence scientific evidences that

472
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:30,419
confirms our marketing approach let's

473
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:33,020
say it's our sales approach so we

474
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:37,200
started doing new houses

475
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:39,740
we developed our own systems which are

476
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,159
basically totally natural based

477
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:46,980
diffusively open means it regulates

478
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:50,460
moisture it has many more advantages

479
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:54,200
that are measurable than any other

480
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:57,120
material so now we are

481
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,940
we are already present in the market

482
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,219
from 217.

483
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,360
and we have three employees constantly

484
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,659
employed

485
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,979
I think we are on a good way to expand

486
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,380
now

487
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,019
do you have any opportunities to change

488
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,780
the legislation since we are all focuses

489
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:18,119
on the Energy Efficiency of houses maybe

490
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:21,599
you have some bonuses here we are

491
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:24,418
already in this process we will have all

492
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:28,798
the certification in a few months I

493
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:32,299
guess uh regarding our materials and our

494
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,879
let's say process itself

495
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:37,379
so it will be

496
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,860
totally aligned with the existing

497
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,860
legislation in this way we are changing

498
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,099
things but we are financing by ourselves

499
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:49,199
everything and it's getting slower

500
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,459
otherwise if we will be financed from

501
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,460
the

502
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,940
uh some other sources it will be much

503
00:23:53,460 --> 00:24:00,240
easier and faster to gain this but let's

504
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,519
say we already made nowadays we are

505
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,079
talking a lot about carbon captures I'm

506
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,599
sorry to interrupt you right now but

507
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,099
this just in if you anybody here drive a

508
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,538
white Audi Q7

509
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,959
because you're parked in front of a bus

510
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,339
and they're upset about it

511
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,919
yeah right

512
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,259
listen you hotwired out driving

513
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,700
we won't be suspicious at all

514
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,140
if you think you know who it is it's

515
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,679
perfect okay perfect then we have a

516
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,360
solution thank you so very much carry on

517
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:31,559
we're talking about carbon capture and

518
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:34,678
this environmental uh impact Etc so we

519
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:37,200
already made life cyclist analysis of

520
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,840
our materials and from the National

521
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,179
Institute of building and it shows that

522
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,119
it's carbon negative material

523
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,860
so means

524
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,599
I don't I don't see and I don't know

525
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:51,240
about the material it is carbon negative

526
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,740
in market so there are many more

527
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,000
advantages that are scientifically

528
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:00,179
proved already which is in our favor and

529
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,940
pushes out of sales forward so Luca

530
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:06,120
fryer we heard about the German model

531
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,759
the second pillar uh there are some

532
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,879
projects scientific projects scientific

533
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:15,779
research they plan to do that would that

534
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,820
help Slovenia as well if these products

535
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,480
would be involved in some scientific

536
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:20,480
research

537
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,240
[Music]

538
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,240
I've

539
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,019
let me

540
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:32,879
I've had the chance to speak to a couple

541
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,400
of companies in Switzerland who were

542
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,960
involved in the pilot programs that they

543
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,380
that have a

544
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,079
permission permit permit and

545
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,260
and are already doing something on the

546
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,939
so I'm referring to the THC market so

547
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:50,940
Switzerland has a couple of pilot

548
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,558
programs each jurisdiction

549
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,720
decides when they want to do it and then

550
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,778
they give couple of licenses we were

551
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,179
looking into one of those ourselves we

552
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:03,179
see ourselves in this market also in the

553
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:06,320
long run once it starts becoming

554
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:06,320
more let's say

555
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:13,500
easier to to get in now the this we're

556
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,480
also in touch with a couple of German

557
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,798
companies which are already working on

558
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,579
the

559
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:22,679
on the so-called

560
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:26,158
getting licenses for cannabis clubs

561
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,360
meaning they can grow for other for

562
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,000
other people

563
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,740
which we could also call like kind of a

564
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,919
pilot program from the German German

565
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,900
government which is help yourself or

566
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,299
have someone to do it for you

567
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,880
uh and yes I think this this kind of

568
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:46,259
programs are becoming more and more uh

569
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,720
thing that seems to work for for other

570
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:51,058
countries so why not I think Slovenia

571
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,579
could also try with couple of pilot

572
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:56,220
programs

573
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:59,220
Define really well what what they want

574
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,440
to achieve and then not make things too

575
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,480
complicated you know make things in a

576
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,419
way that uh

577
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,360
even small companies can maybe come even

578
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:13,740
maybe normal just regular people with

579
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:15,959
know-how and and the proper approach try

580
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,500
and do something on this field because

581
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,480
it seems like fighting this uon treaty

582
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,240
and

583
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,278
other regulations that prevent

584
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,339
governments from changing the law

585
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:32,759
quickly and efficiently is the way to go

586
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:34,619
yeah so I would definitely endorse

587
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,658
something like that so would you and

588
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,759
your company be involved in such a

589
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,278
project we would probably what kind of

590
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,679
study would you be involved in so we

591
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,839
tried to get licenses for uh for

592
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,538
different studies so as I mentioned we

593
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,778
had received a license to produce

594
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:55,500
medical cannabis in Macedonia in 2017.

595
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:58,319
at that time Macedonian legislation had

596
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,558
a a part of the legislation said that

597
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:04,439
you can only plant uh strains that are

598
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:07,139
on your European seed list that was a

599
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,380
complete mistake in the legislation

600
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:14,460
because you couldn't grow there was no

601
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:17,159
THC dominant plans on the so that led us

602
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,620
to the to to start the project in

603
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,380
Slovenia we prepared everything with the

604
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:25,319
faculty of agronomy and faculty of

605
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,960
Pharmacy in Ljubljana a really really

606
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:31,139
quality project

607
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,778
um and went to the Ministry of Health to

608
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,720
apply for a research license we wanted

609
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:40,079
to breed new strains so breeding strains

610
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,360
it would eventually be listed on the

611
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,220
European seed list because we've also

612
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,379
learned in the process that it's now

613
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,400
possible to register strains with high

614
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,799
THC in in Holland and so we went with

615
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,860
that project to the Ministry of Health

616
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,900
and we were really I mean surprised with

617
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,979
what kind of arrogance we were turned

618
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,380
down

619
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:06,419
in Slovenia he has the the who was that

620
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,700
who was the person there

621
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,159
you want me to name name the person

622
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,460
really

623
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,020
will this be on any news or sure

624
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,360
um so it was the lady that was

625
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,889
responsible at that time is Kirsten

626
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,979
petrich

627
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:25,200
[Music]

628
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:28,200
so her her point of view was that only

629
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,259
and until she is present in the ministry

630
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,019
nobody but government

631
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:35,579
institutes and bodies will be able to do

632
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,940
research

633
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:43,220
and or production that involves cannabis

634
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:47,100
so what did you do today we had to like

635
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,659
bow down and leave the place we were

636
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:51,298
actually treated like we were some

637
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,520
criminals there almost like and I've had

638
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:56,038
the honor to have two professors from

639
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,139
the University of Pharmacy in Ljubljana

640
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:01,500
with me and one Professor from

641
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:04,620
University of agronomy

642
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,659
and we left with a big I don't know how

643
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,339
to say with the lamp in our throats like

644
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,580
it was really hard to digest that

645
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,579
because

646
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,819
really spent a lot of time and it put a

647
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,240
lot of effort in it so yeah then we've

648
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:23,278
also applied to arso to the to get funds

649
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,880
from the government to get this project

650
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,839
approved there or subsidized and it was

651
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,000
the same

652
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,359
no success we were graded very low with

653
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,359
our project

654
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:37,679
what about your experiences not so good

655
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,500
ones I mean

656
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,200
in what way

657
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,419
regarding your production

658
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:49,399
legislation we had a license anecdotes

659
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,399
that come in this business

660
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,558
firstly the

661
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:57,178
it was really interesting when we

662
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:58,200
started this

663
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,100
um

664
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,919
I first went to the

665
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:06,839
health Ministry to get information what

666
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,220
can we do what are the regulations

667
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:14,480
please tell me what are the limits and

668
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:18,480
within within which limits should we be

669
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:22,558
and there were no clear answers for this

670
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,079
thing and when we started we asked okay

671
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,058
is it legal to put these products on the

672
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:30,960
market because we know it's

673
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:34,200
if ifsa European food Association has

674
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,000
this on a novel food list can we

675
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,519
actually make

676
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,440
food supplements out of this or is it

677
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:44,398
only cosmetics and

678
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:47,340
they said yep well you can do them it's

679
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:51,119
prohibited to do them you can do them

680
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:54,778
and if you you make them then there's no

681
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:57,418
regulation or no law that would give

682
00:31:54,778 --> 00:32:00,359
these products out of the market and I

683
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,299
was shocked and with the lump in my

684
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:07,859
throat going out and say it was

685
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:10,619
unimaginable how non-regulated can one

686
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:13,379
substance be on the other hand for

687
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:15,379
example I had a interesting story from

688
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,659
our production company

689
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:21,600
and a few others that we talked about at

690
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,880
that time when we came with a list of

691
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,619
ingredients that we don't want in our

692
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,980
products

693
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:30,778
we want cannabis we want other Botanical

694
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,679
extracts and there was no problem

695
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:37,940
problem with rosemary and so on

696
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:41,640
but there was one thing that came

697
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:44,100
staying in my mind and that is when I

698
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,960
got a question why are you doing the

699
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:49,139
list of products that you don't want

700
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,360
inside because this list of products can

701
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,659
make your products

702
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:57,778
really cheaper so your profit will be

703
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,419
instead of this you'll get this and I

704
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:02,759
was like okay I'm probably the dumbest

705
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:05,399
person in the world but we have actually

706
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:08,759
made a list of products that we of

707
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:12,359
ingredients that we don't want in our uh

708
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,558
products because it's so uh

709
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,500
harmful

710
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,839
so Petro this is like the story of blind

711
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,000
bleeding with the blind when you go to

712
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,398
the offices I mean how do you actually

713
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,440
decide what to do

714
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:29,939
uh business-wise it's hard because

715
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,120
business wise you have to look for the

716
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,640
profit eventually

717
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:38,639
but I still believe that connecting

718
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:42,600
people and um

719
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:48,059
maybe gather people from different

720
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:51,619
fields and giving a chance like Luca

721
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:54,200
said before maybe to regular people that

722
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:57,678
know their stuff

723
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,659
I think that's the way to to implement

724
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,120
changes into our lives and for example

725
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,899
Slovenia has a wonderful

726
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,098
um

727
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:13,918
chance right now with the flooding to

728
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:16,559
show an example of good practice with

729
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,679
growing cannabis in all the fields that

730
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:23,099
are heavy polluted with

731
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,358
heavy metals that was in the News 14

732
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:30,179
days ago and all the the pesticides that

733
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:33,358
are in our country we can actually make

734
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:35,820
Slovenia clean again and we can do this

735
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,159
with this magical

736
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,720
plant it's like

737
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,419
it is Magic

738
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,699
so primozzores is there a story or a

739
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:48,980
person in bureaucracy that

740
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,980
you dream of from time to time

741
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:58,618
I am person like I'm trying to eliminate

742
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:02,239
everything from my head that that wasn't

743
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:06,480
so okay but it teaches me usually a lot

744
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:10,199
and I turn around this experience to

745
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,539
move forward there were some stories it

746
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:16,379
was one let's say funny stories if I'm

747
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:17,900
going back at my when I was finishing my

748
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,720
study also

749
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,460
because I was making already a

750
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,699
comparison about

751
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,820
from data that the word these times from

752
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:32,939
hemp Creed and other materials

753
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,940
and one Professor it was doctor doctor

754
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,559
so I mean double doctor I guess he had a

755
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,320
lot of knowledge about materials and

756
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,980
everything asked me

757
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:45,000
uh you that he was very skeptical about

758
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,900
maintaining costs of that kind of

759
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,880
building

760
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,099
and he said when you go from time to

761
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,338
time and cut the corner and roll it and

762
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,660
smoke it so the maintaining costs can go

763
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:55,880
up up

764
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:59,338
so

765
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,440
it's very funny because smoking climb

766
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:04,460
and hemp can be very harmful for them

767
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,159
but he didn't know I guess

768
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,039
but in general let's say in institutions

769
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:15,838
there there was a lot of closed doors

770
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:18,659
during years no no subsidies when I was

771
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,059
trying to let's say help customers to

772
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:22,940
gain subsidies for that kind of build

773
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:25,739
Building Solutions

774
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,740
but there are there are already because

775
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:31,139
there is a initiative care for climate

776
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:32,838
which is more and more present in

777
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:35,338
building sector

778
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:38,759
there are more and more people also in

779
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:41,838
government institutions that are that

780
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,599
that they like very much that kind of

781
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:48,000
bio-based material so basically there

782
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,838
was a lot of struggle at the beginning

783
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,780
but if you are consistent and move

784
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,539
forward move forward I look positive in

785
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,300
every aspect of my life so is there any

786
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:01,920
question from the public q a maybe five

787
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,400
minutes for Q a because there was a

788
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,320
person who wanted to ask something yes

789
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,800
wait I have the microphone I'm coming

790
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,800
I'm coming

791
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,260
okay

792
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:21,660
I would like to ask Luke actually about

793
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,680
your new new artificial cannabinoids

794
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:26,899
that you are doing are these

795
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,460
molecules that are mimicking natural

796
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,740
cannabinoids or are these

797
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,599
endogenous endocannabinoids like

798
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:36,379
molecules

799
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,720
some of these molecules are

800
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,880
also produced by the plant because

801
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:45,659
they're produced from CBD with the

802
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,300
synthesis and enzyme enzymatic processes

803
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:52,319
you can also change the CBD to this

804
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,099
other non-listed cannabinoids which are

805
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,019
not

806
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:58,559
in nature you don't find them in

807
00:37:55,019 --> 00:38:03,920
abundancy at least not so but they're

808
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:07,619
quite easy and the the the technology is

809
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,980
relatively inexpensive and the

810
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,599
production is cost effective and the

811
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,179
product is really safe in the end

812
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,119
because it's basically just

813
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:20,759
the reagent solvent usually and then

814
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,099
purification when you get the the final

815
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,760
result we're not actually involved in

816
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:29,338
producing any of those we mostly uh we

817
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,920
do the service of applying these

818
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:34,099
cannabinoids on in a different cannabis

819
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,139
materials like flowers

820
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:40,440
pollen you know like yeah it's a thing

821
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,299
Tamara it's a thing now I thought you

822
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,820
are also using them for some kind of

823
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,460
pilot studies somewhere no no no no no

824
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:50,820
no no no not like I said we're mostly

825
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,920
con during service because we have a

826
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,599
proprietary technology which we bought

827
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,579
also in Slovenia I have to say that

828
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,680
there is this company this little

829
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,780
startup that made this fantastic machine

830
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,039
that we're using and this kind of

831
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,740
launched us to the international

832
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,739
European markets because it's the

833
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:11,639
technology is really cool and fakes good

834
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:13,319
results so many customers find us and

835
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:18,239
we're scaling this production and then

836
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:20,940
we do mostly we do the service of let's

837
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,219
say homogenizing we're now looking also

838
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,619
into pharmaceutical industry where we

839
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:26,819
could with this device we can homogenize

840
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,460
for instance

841
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,720
flowers in when you standardize a

842
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,838
cannabis flower

843
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:36,779
you got the top flowers range between 18

844
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,440
and 20 percent THC these flowers you

845
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,660
register and then you can sell them as

846
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,659
active pharmaceutical ingredient but all

847
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:48,239
the lower flowers on the plant are are

848
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:51,118
lower in cannabinoids yeah yeah so now

849
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:54,179
this technology allows us to boost or to

850
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,720
to take the extract from the the lower

851
00:39:54,179 --> 00:40:00,659
quality plant material and apply it to

852
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:03,299
the to the material that has less active

853
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:06,118
ingredient and therefore the producer

854
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,339
can really use the whole plant as

855
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:10,619
something so you can you can homogenize

856
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:12,599
with this technology for instance this

857
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,358
is a direction we're looking into right

858
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,400
now I'm trying to offer our service to

859
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,799
some of the medical cannabis companies

860
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,800
yeah because it's also in the medical

861
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,019
industry the Holy Grail is how much THC

862
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,839
or how much active ingredients you can

863
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:30,239
you can give to your customer so it's

864
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,130
new Green Technology it's a new thing

865
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,219
it's a new

866
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,019
[Music]

867
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:40,919
is there any other question

868
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:43,280
yes please there is a man on the back

869
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,280
yeah

870
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,640
I have a question about marketing

871
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,500
because

872
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,460
I know that there is sometimes problems

873
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,960
to reach the customers there are some

874
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,900
problems with social media in general

875
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,940
Banning the

876
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,338
bearing the marketing of the product so

877
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,358
I'm interested in how do you overcome

878
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:11,358
these problems

879
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,639
very hard

880
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:23,039
for example on Facebook

881
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:26,098
with our page Nabi we cannot even say

882
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:29,519
it's a beautiful sunny day outside

883
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:31,260
because and sponsor it because the

884
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,699
because we sell CBD and that's

885
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,460
prohibited

886
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:38,039
and we sell CBD which is legal which can

887
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,880
we can sell in our shop we can sell it

888
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:44,119
online everywhere but it's illegal to to

889
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,099
put a post about this

890
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:50,039
uh we tried different approach we didn't

891
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,640
use influencers

892
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,099
um

893
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:58,440
it was a special reason for that and I'm

894
00:41:53,099 --> 00:42:01,260
not that uh sorry that we didn't and we

895
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,380
tried in Slovenia for example we did

896
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,200
some interesting

897
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,480
moves that were not known here for

898
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:13,500
example we were selling our products in

899
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,559
90 degree Mark chops or 100 in Slovenia

900
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:20,579
which is a big thing to be in every

901
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:24,659
village in Slovenia and uh nobody knew

902
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:28,980
about us so we made a product which were

903
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:31,799
a pack of gummies that were called that

904
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:36,240
cost seven Euro and something

905
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:40,440
and the and the big bag that costs I

906
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:43,259
don't know 20. and to approach the

907
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,960
customers we did the small packaging

908
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,640
which was totally unprofitable for us

909
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,800
because of the packaging and the

910
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,799
aluminum boxes and everything it's

911
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,579
expensive so we kind of

912
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:00,000
did the marketing part with this kind of

913
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:01,640
product and it showed off that it showed

914
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,679
up that

915
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:07,078
people are buying the small packages

916
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:11,219
because it's not that much money to try

917
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:14,280
products in the next month the

918
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:17,578
people were buying I don't know the the

919
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,000
the the sale of the big package was

920
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,579
tripled four times so it it was growing

921
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,219
eventually and we we gathered a lot of

922
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:29,780
customers in this way and uh another

923
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:32,279
interesting story was we

924
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,440
since we didn't put a lot of money into

925
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,920
the marketing into

926
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:41,940
um the paper uh I don't know newspapers

927
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,358
and so on uh we invested this uh into

928
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:49,679
giving away our products so the customer

929
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:53,098
has his own its own experience to unpack

930
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:56,098
it to try it in the safety of their home

931
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:59,039
to see that there's no THC inside I

932
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:02,579
don't feel any bad reactions out of it

933
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:05,639
and people started buying our stuff

934
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:10,440
because of that so we for example we

935
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:14,279
gave away 500 gummies or gave away 500

936
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,159
body oils to people to try it and we got

937
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,859
actually 80 percent repurchase out of

938
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:23,399
that so that was a big thing for any

939
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:28,019
cosmetic product we know women never try

940
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,940
never change their cream and we kind of

941
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:33,780
did that so I think

942
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:36,300
you can do it it's hard hard also

943
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:39,780
because for example we didn't even try

944
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,400
to beat Google we could do that with a

945
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,280
lot of expenses and everything we didn't

946
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,980
even try it but we showed up in every

947
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,339
conference that there was so we were

948
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,920
there we were trying to educate people

949
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:55,440
we tried to approach newspapers with

950
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,460
informative

951
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,358
um

952
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:03,240
content that they need for their for

953
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:07,019
their newspapers and so on so it was

954
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:10,559
it's kind of more talking about the

955
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:14,338
planned about the cleanliness of the

956
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,559
products then how our product is good I

957
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:18,739
I never spoke about how good is our

958
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,719
product that I speak about

959
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:24,479
ingredients and the mixes and mostly

960
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:26,879
what is harmful and people are really

961
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,679
eager to know about this

962
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,119
thank you so much did you want to say

963
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,578
something

964
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,858
half of the sentence because you

965
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:37,079
I just wanted to say that we saw that

966
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:38,759
maybe the emerging cannabis

967
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,880
opportunities for slovenians are

968
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,760
startups spin-offs together with

969
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,980
universities maybe if you agree I would

970
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,500
that would be maybe the conclusion and

971
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,940
