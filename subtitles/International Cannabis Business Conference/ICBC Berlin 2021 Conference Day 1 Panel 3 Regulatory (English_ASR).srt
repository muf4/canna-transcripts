1
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,279
so one thing to be clear right now

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,919
cannabis is highly complex the

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,879
regulatory environment

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,198
is

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,199
ever changing and we need to be

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,520
differentiating our products against it

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,840
and success is most likely to achieve

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,839
pipeline by being meticulous

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,920
about identifying potential risks and

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,920
opportunities and by being

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,679
always up to date with the latest

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,359

capitalism

44

uncertainties and challenges producers

and can you give us a quick update on

50

thank you so much for your kind

55
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,599
introduction

56
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,118
this is a very long question and i can

57
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,038
actually speak for the next three hours

58
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,560
about the regulatory environment within

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,799
germany and europe

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
but i would like to touch on just three

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,520
through theirs uh

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,159
just i would say in the last couple of

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,560
months

64
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,919
the first one is with respect to the

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,479
production producers there are a lot of

66
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,759
new producers coming up

67
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,238
in particular

68
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,598
we have heard that this morning already

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,599
producers coming from the european union

70
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,959
like in spain

71
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,719
greece

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,759
and other countries

73
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,039
but there are also cultivators

74
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,439
in other

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,519
countries outside of the european union

76
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,959
who would like to get

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
their products exported into europe and

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,719
to june

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,959
they are currently facing a significant

80
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,680
issue which is

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,120
receiving their

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,599
certification for their performance

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,158
those who are outside of the european

84
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,158
union need to have an inspection

85
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,120
off-site inspection of the facility in

86
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,120
order to get the eu gp certification by

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,719
the respective authorities

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,599
in germany

89
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,919
as

90
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,479
you to call it currently we have trailer

91
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,518
restrictions we have a long list of

92
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,000
different

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,640
producers in countries outside of the

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,039
european union who are waiting for

95
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,238
officers coming over to their side and

96
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,439
to get respective eu certification and

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,840
we will see

98
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,759
hopefully what is

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,759
to a certain extent overcome

100
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,759
these

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,598
for our clients is that indoor growing

102
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,560
is

103
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,399
at least the basis for

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
a steady quality

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
which can be much more easily achieved

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,238
under these certain circumstances of

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
indoor growing than in greenhouse or

108
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,560
even outdoor

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,560
and with respect to the

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
german monography

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
with

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,840
quality

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,000
provisions regarding

114
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:34,000
cannabis the thc content should not

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,519
deviate more as times 10 from division

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,360
which is a challenge for producers and

117
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,240
even some producers who are currently

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,160
exporting them to germany may have

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,319
difficulties to really

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,919
reach this plus minus 10 percent and

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,918
last but not least the wholesalers we

122
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:53,198
have heard of this mod already

123
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,240
they are under are confronted with the

124
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,600
price

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,319
erosion

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
is a price reduction and another price

127
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,478
fight right now

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
the

129
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,240
respective agreements between the

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,199
health insurance association and the

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,000
pharmacies to fix the price to a maximum

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,280
of 952

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,038
for per gram of flowers

134
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,159
it was an indication of certain price

135
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,759
control

136
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,360
and we see that this 952 program

137
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
from the wholesale to the pharmacy

138
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,800
which have a significant impact

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
and

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,560
reduced pricing significance

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,879
in 1996 there were the last reform um

142
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,479
and then we had a still literally until

143
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,120
2017

144
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,959
and 2017 germany legalized medical

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,720
cannabis but only due to a personal to a

146
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,159
private patient

147
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,120
litigating his right to foreign

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
and the court accepted this right and

149
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
provided him

150
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
the option to drop this all americans at

151
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,879
home and then the federal government

152
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,399
said nobody doesn't want that we don't

153
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,759
want the patients about their own

154
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,959
cannabis it's too much of a

155
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,598
distress for society for police

156
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,279
lot of foreign medical cannabis that was

157
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,918
a milestone of course

158
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,038
but in regard to hemp and recreational

159
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,560
cannabis there's still sales that until

160
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:03,519
1996

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,280
we had 2017 the last elections

162
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,198
the last elections and the green party

163
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,598
were negotiating with the liberals and

164
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,280
the conservatives

165
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,399
for a coalition

166
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,198
for

167
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:18,079
for the support of micah coalition this

168
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,759
coalition negotiations lasted four weeks

169
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,800
and then the liberals said no we don't

170
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
want to

171
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
govern

172
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,839
because we might put government falsely

173
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
so

174
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,359
at all

175
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,038
and then the main coalition came and

176
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
another skill set

177
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,680
so that's four years

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,800
but then you saw two important decisions

179
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,000
by the courts by the ecg in november

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,720
2020

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,759
saying the kind of web case

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
at stake was cbd eliquid and

183
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,160
the

184
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,759
ecg said

185
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,160
no cbd has no psychoactive properties

186
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,038
and the french government couldn't prove

187
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,360
any

188
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,399
health risks for the

189
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,000
population

190
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:04,638
so they said it's uh movements of goods

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,120
the principle applies here it's legal in

192
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,759
the czech republic and has to believe in

193
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,639
france as well that was also a milestone

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,639
from the god and then

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,280
in march

196
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,680
this year

197
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,878
because law enforcement said you can't

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,639
give away any head product to their

199
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,639
consumer for consumption purposes

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,560
the federal court of justice said then

201
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,119
okay you can give it to the head

202
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,119
consumer which is a very big change was

203
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,399
a very good change but still the

204
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,639
question of

205
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,278
the misuse of interpretation is not

206
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,519
clear right now so that's why we decided

207
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,439
to start a procedure on the principle of

208
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,679
removal of goods

209
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
we applied for a general decree for

210
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,759
clients of us

211
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
because the cbd flowers are very popular

212
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,399
in germany flowers they are legal in

213
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,080
luxembourg austria

214
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,278
and

215
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
belgium

216
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,720
and

217
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,719
so if they are in these eu countries

218
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
they should be eaten in germany too and

219
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
we applied at the

220
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,719
federal office of consumer protection

221
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,039
for this general degree

222
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,278
this was dismissed in this application

223
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,039
and so we started

224
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,360
yesterday two days ago

225
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,360
we filed a lawsuit to the administrative

226
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
court of contract

227
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,879
helps me that the court will say okay

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,879
it's

229
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,838
it's a matter of you being not here

230
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,679
but

231
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
he may have would be if the next

232
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,159
election outcome would be that

233
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,800
we had another before and liberalize

234
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,639
these regulations

235
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,838
thank you man

236
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,278
and let's get a question to you um

237
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
what do you think what are the most

238
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,439
important questions farmers should ask

239
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,838
themselves before entering the german

240
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
industry from a regulatory point of view

241
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
can you tell us something about the

242
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,880
ecosystems that are in place here of

243
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
course

244
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,838
i think it's very important to

245
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,838
understand

246
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,880
that the end market and the medical

247
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,360
economics market are totally different

248
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,240
so you should always be aware that you

249
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,879
have to prepare as well as you can

250
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,959
before entering the markets

251
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,519
because there will be a lot of struggles

252
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,679
or there are still struggles

253
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,360
entering the market and i think

254
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,799
it will take some time to regulate

255
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
everything

256
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,399
it's getting better and better since

257
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,399
2017.

258
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,278
now we have a regulation and you should

259
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,679
be very well prepared

260
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,360
because you need a long breath and it's

261
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,159
not like running a

262
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,839
sprint it's more like running a monitor

263
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,199
entering the market

264
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
and

265
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
yeah for example the medicine market you

266
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,159
you also have to

267
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,880
to face a lot of uh

268
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,199
questions regarding or from your local

269
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,559
authorities opium shelter

270
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,959
and registering the products and

271
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:15,119
i think this is now more regulated than

272
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:18,000
the end market in my opinion and

273
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,639
yeah so you should always think about

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,480
that it takes much more time than you

275
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,838
expect

276
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,278
and

277
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
yeah

278
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,879
so

279
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,120
there are two um things there's hemp

280
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,120
against cannabis and within all of that

281
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,078
there's cd peter

282
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,360
cbd lifestyle

283
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,078
well

284
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,399
if you look into the cbd market

285
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,479
and into the regulatory environment

286
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,720
regarding cbd products

287
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,039
and you can actually sell cbd products

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,160
in three different sections

289
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,679
one is cosmetics including

290
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,159
gts

291
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,838
the second one is good sound evidence

292
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,639
i'll come to that in a minute and the

293
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,639
third one is

294
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,610
so with regard to cosmetics the

295
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,039
respective

296
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,600
[Music]

297
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,759
rules and regulations of the directive

298
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,320
for cosmetics of the european union

299
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,000
deployment which are not that stupid

300
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
however you have to be careful with

301
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,958
regarding the cbd to be implemented into

302
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,320
the cbd product because the german

303
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,559
economics act sees it is much stricter

304
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
and currently put that in comparison to

305
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,359
the european directive

306
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,199
and here

307
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,440
the european court of justice decision

308
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
which my colleague just mentioned may

309
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:39,160
help in the future

310
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:39,159
as we're clearly stating that cbd is

311
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,639
with respect to the fruit side event i

312
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,160
think there's an european commission

313
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,039
very clearly

314
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,360
confirmed that these food supplements

315
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,120
which contain cbd need to be registered

316
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,200
under the global food directive of the

317
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,120
european union so

318
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,720
we have currently about 40 or 45 maybe

319
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,078
50 respective applications for student

320
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,040
supplements

321
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,838
pending

322
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,838
to be recognized as

323
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,440
which

324
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,040
includes cbd and last but not least with

325
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,959
regard to medicine products containing

326
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,679
you need as you discussed this morning

327
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,359
in the first place

328
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,078
authorization about the authorization

329
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,320
for these drugs

330
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,958
so you have to be careful if

331
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,600
the ball alive between supplements

332
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,399
cosmetics and medicine products is the

333
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,639
medical claim if you have a product

334
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,879
for example which is a nicer supplement

335
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,879
you have

336
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,278
[Music]

337
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,600
improving your health condition to a

338
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:07,039
certain extent like

339
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,199
it's helpful for skin inflammations that

340
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,240
would qualify that prolapse medicine

341
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,078
product

342
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,039
and definitely

343
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,039
so the cbd market

344
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,838
difficult is moving forward with the

345
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,920
help of the european court of justice

346
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,320
and this

347
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:26,799
is an advantage

348
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,079
thank you kai what would you say

349
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,919
in all this

350
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,198
regulatory crazy

351
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,159
[Music]

352
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,039
as we say in german what will

353
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,879
the

354
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,360
elections play in terms of cannabis

355
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,159
reform and what factors could limit or

356
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,240
destroy the success of ongoing cannabis

357
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,719
reform

358
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,799
yeah the the elections will play a bit

359
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
well this year we are at a decisive

360
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,078
point in time here in germany as i

361
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,958
mentioned before

362
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,198
there were still some still there over

363
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,078
two decades almost

364
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:03,519
and this year germany has the chance to

365
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,278
start reform in all three areas

366
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,320
of cannabis

367
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,360
and at the moment it looks like that

368
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
this reform will take place because when

369
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,839
the

370
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,639
final results of the federal elections

371
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,519
will be clear at the 26th of

372
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,440
september so in four weeks time

373
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,839
we will see that we will have a new

374
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,320
chancellor a new government a new

375
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,560
coalition new parties and in every

376
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
constellation at least one party

377
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,159
probably two parties for complete

378
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,959
legalization of cannabis for

379
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:41,039
recreational cannabis and all parties in

380
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,039
the cbo agreed at the end of

381
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,000
because we see the law and we saw law

382
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,680
enforcement actions since january really

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,159
strict and

384
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,679
powerful law enforcement actions even

385
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,600
against handily key trailers and he has

386
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,278
been on the shelves in germany for

387
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,079
decades and

388
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,559
law enforcement decided early this year

389
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,958
also to go after handy

390
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,719
because it's canvas and it's

391
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,159
not possessed and

392
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,199
from that

393
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,198
point it's comprehensible to

394
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,599
is a great product and we see that with

395
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,240
everything every we can make a

396
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,240
discussion of everything is a cbd

397
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
product it's a supplement is there is

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,600
phd in it

399
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,278
is the cfg called enough to be uh

400
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,240
then we have the uh

401
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,799
ecg ruling which which helps but that is

402
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,278
a strong need for cannabis reform and i

403
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,359
hope that the

404
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,838
new government will also take early

405
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,278
steps right after

406
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,240
the new government came in place

407
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,639
for

408
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
decriminalization it's very very

409
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,400
important point that should be the first

410
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
measure of a new government and then we

411
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,959
can agree on the rules for recreational

412
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,079
uh in the next two years but the

413
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,199
accumulated immunization would be a big

414
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,639
advance

415
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,079
step

416
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,559
and then we can talk about modern

417
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,558
projects

418
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,519
and and how the rules will work on

419
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
that

420
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,038
okay just add that right here

421
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,558
we have to use

422
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,480
currently on the spot we are

423
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,240
representing one of the largest

424
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,200
producers in germany and they had a

425
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,839
wonderful team in that portfolio

426
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,558
system also believed to study

427
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:47,359
for two reasons reason number one

428
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,240
it is against the law to insert b

429
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,759
to c

430
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,558
uh and secondly it has exactly an effect

431
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,200
so it was from pure help

432
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:00,160
no thc definitely not

433
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,160
what actually happened

434
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:08,798
what really happened was uh the

435
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,200
federal court uh actually decided e2c is

436
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,160
possible oh my clients thought oh that's

437
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,798
fine

438
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
but then they are using an expert

439
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,720
witness

440
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,599
who actually

441
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,960
stated that if you use the hemp tea

442
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,719
leaves

443
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
and put that into

444
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,640
cookies

445
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,639
and bake it

446
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,640
[Music]

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,720
but that is something which

448
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,799
is kind of strange

449
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,880
we hope that this is going to change in

450
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,200
particular with regard to hemp because

451
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
industrial hemp as we all know has been

452
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,720
on

453
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,639
on the shelves have have been sold

454
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,600
for a long time

455
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,640
so

456
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,480
this shows this hatchery heterogeneous

457
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,360
environment which we're facing in the

458
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,839
different areas of cbd products and

459
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,839
products

460
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,720
so let me just quickly back to

461
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,720
how would you say

462
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,798
if we get cannabis regulation for

463
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,679
recreational cannabis in germany how

464
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,400
would this affect medicinal cannabis and

465
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
products here

466
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,279
of course this would be uh it was called

467
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,519
this was would cause a boom the green

468
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,960
rush

469
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,119
[Music]

470
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,919
hundreds thousands of companies

471
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,798
only dealing with irrigation kind of

472
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,640
thousands of jobs tax revenues

473
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,558
and

474
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,480
engineering businesses taking care of

475
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,200
the product quality

476
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,200
and consulting services uh

477
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,000
yeah that would have a great impact of

478
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,279
course

479
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,720
as

480
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,079
our

481
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,240
panel before they discussed already the

482
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,879
american campus industry will

483
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,960
probably get not a problem but

484
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
they always have a natural advantage in

485
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,000
the market because of the option of

486
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,799
reimbursement

487
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,599
the public health providers

488
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:10,000
so but then we have to focus on really

489
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,158
medical uh purposes

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,038
and the studies and then we need more

491
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,600
evidence and more uh more painful twice

492
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,400
clinical studies

493
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,759
designation areas where patients can

494
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
rely on

495
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,119
the the normal patient probably would go

496
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,200
up to the recreational market and

497
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,558
get their medicine for

498
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,440
their own therapy therapy there

499
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,960
so

500
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,840
but the market will open up we have 600

501
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,600
to 800 tons of dry flowers to the black

502
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,759
market in the regression black market in

503
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,240
germany

504
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,960
so there's lots of potential for for

505
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
that if we have

506
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,080
but i think that

507
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,839
both markets

508
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,960
can coexist because the first one is the

509
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,119
regression market and then it is

510
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,240
regulated in another way and the second

511
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,639
one is

512
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,359
that the patients get the costs covered

513
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,480
by the public health insurance so maybe

514
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:17,519
the medical market will

515
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,798
be a little bit um

516
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,918
smaller

517
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,679
but i think both markets can work

518
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,000
for sure yes but then of course the

519
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,919
public health insurers probably ask

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,880
why should we pay such a

521
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,360
such a expensive therapy they just go to

522
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,360
the next uh

523
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,079
yeah

524
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,079
still i think like we should not

525
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,480
underestimate the need for a doctor when

526
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,798
you're a sick person so

527
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,880
i definitely also think that medicinal

528
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,279
cannabis will still exist even though we

529
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,039
have a regulatory environment for

530
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,038
recreational cannabis

531
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,759
let's talk about regulatory environment

532
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,240
in the european union basically we have

533
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,839
a free trade union here in the european

534
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,679
union unless we're talking about

535
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,519
cannabis peter um

536
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,840
what possibilities do you see for

537
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,960
regulatory organization

538
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,558
level

539
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,319
yeah i think we need to go back a little

540
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,119
bit in history

541
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,119
and you may ask

542
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,279
and this is a resolution

543
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,679
of the european parliament dated on 13th

544
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,798
february 2019

545
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,400
which calls the european commission

546
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,000
to harmonize

547
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,240
the european

548
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,480
legal environment for the use of

549
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,919
medicinal colors

550
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,079
it has not been re-recognized

551
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,480
this is the initial step forward for

552
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,240
creating a new directive which needs

553
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,798
then to be implemented

554
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,640
in the respective legislations of the eu

555
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,038
united states

556
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,200
and it has been that it was published

557
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,798
celebrated by the chambers yes yeah we

558
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,360
are going forward

559
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,599
probably nobody has read it completely

560
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,639
but if you look into those 18 different

561
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,158
points

562
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,880
i would like to cite just two points

563
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,320
to make you understand where the danger

564
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,919
of those resolutions the point itself

565
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,798
reads as follows

566
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,280
calls our member states to reconsider

567
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,599
the relevant legislation of the use of

568
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,558
currency-based medicines

569
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,119
scientific research proves that the same

570
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:29,519
positive effect can be achieved by using

571
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,359
ordinary medicines that do not have

572
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,679
addictive effects

573
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,678
oops

574
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,599
that is something which is totally

575
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,359
contrary to the development which we

576
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,759
have earlier in the market and the

577
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,678
number 14 is the universe

578
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,079
calls on the commission to work with

579
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,320
member states to ensure that safe and

580
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,558
controlled cannabis used for menstrual

581
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,678
purposes can only be in the form of

582
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:56,158
cannabis revived products that have gone

583
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,798
through clinical trials regulatory

584
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,400
assessment and approval

585
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:04,200
which is not yet the case as you all

586
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,200
know who is

587
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,319
the pharmacist is going to do a hand

588
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,720
manufacturing thing before he hands it

589
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:16,639
over to the patients so there is no uh

590
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,558
relationship approval necessary no

591
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,159
marketing improvement

592
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:24,720
and as such uh you know this is is kind

593
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,159
of dangerous if the eu commission will

594
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,600
follow and implements the respective uh

595
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,880
direction

596
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,879
so the industry has to work against that

597
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,080
has to work with the information in

598
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,159
order to

599
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,439
have an environment a regulatory

600
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,960
environment throughout your

601
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,278
establishment

602
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,798
for the industry and not against the

603
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,640
interests of things

604
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,038
when this will be implemented while

605
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,520
nobody else corbit has of course uh

606
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,200
slowed down each and every process uh

607
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,960
for the year in commission and they are

608
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
not as quick as you know

609
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,360
in general

610
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,079
but

611
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,599
there's a process going on and we have

612
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,879
as an industry

613
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,959
to to

614
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,600
put forward our interests

615
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,240
and to lobby the interests of the

616
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,240
respective

617
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,360
only agree uh it's in each and every one

618
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,558
of our responsibilities to lobby for

619
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,639
policy and to be there and to

620
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,879
work together as an industry so we can

621
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,600
get a more harmonized and also

622
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,960
operatable regulatory framework where

623
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,918
our interests are reflected in and we're

624
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,679
not there taking decisions that we have

625
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,440
to work with that in the end

626
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,320
so we're always at the end like i have

627
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,159
one last question for all the speakers

628
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,480
what is your personal message to our

629
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,520
founders and investors having a look at

630
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,000
the cannabis regulatory environment many

631
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,000
times

632
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,599
yeah look at the rules the state of line

633
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,960
but don't let them

634
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,199
over value

635
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,200
if it's too

636
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
confusing or it doesn't make sense

637
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,559
and i think

638
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:15,278
you should have a very long breath and

639
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,278
you have to fight

640
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,880
make yourself available with the

641
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,120
heterogeneous

642
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,919
regulatory environment not only within

643
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,599
europe but also within germany different

644
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,080
states has different views as you heard

645
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,319
this morning on what kind of products

646
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,278
are it has an impact on your on your

647
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,918
business

648
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,480
and of course how any of the investments

649
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,799
and as such make yourself familiar with

650
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,480
all these different and

651
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,720
heterogeneous regulations

652
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,519
okay great um

653
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,038
yeah

654
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,319
yeah do we have time we have science

655
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,798
there's a question right there look he's

656
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,960
so excited

657
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,960
here

658
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,118
[Music]

659
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,439
market here as in

660
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,158
non-champions

661
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
has anybody heard about any

662
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,679
conversation landing or if that's moving

663
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,519
forward

664
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,840
yeah we have indeed currently a route

665
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:22,000
of colorless products which are just

666
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:23,839
gacp processed into europe and into the

667
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,119
german market as well

668
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:30,398
products are then here we've refined

669
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,479
under eu gop certification and then sold

670
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,278
into the market the authorities are

671
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,759
looking very closely into discipline

672
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,200
because of patient safety of course is

673
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,839
something which

674
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,960
is top on that is

675
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,798
and we'll see how the authorities react

676
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,480
but they are watching it very very

677
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,200
closely and

678
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,919
also whether these products which are

679
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,319
important to the european union and into

680
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,919
their data to germany

681
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:02,240
we know one

682
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:04,159
producer from ui via spain into germany

683
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,519
has been the only

684
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,520
ghcp process there is a kind of a great

685
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,879
zone between regarding the trying

686
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:16,398
process free trial is allowed under jcp

687
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,120
really a further driving process is gnp

688
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,119
and would then require gdp certification

689
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,678
so and if you have a product which

690
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,639
arrives in europe which has the ability

691
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,480
of maybe 20 or less

692
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,520
that might not be gacp process

693
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,079
and so

694
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,278
only in gsp process this may be also a

695
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,158
gmp

696
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,880
process which of course would

697
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,880
lead to certification it is not entirely

698
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
useless

699
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,158
currently the night of the german

700
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,079
authorities are looking into that in

701
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,679
particular some of the lower

702
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,038
pharmaceutical authorities in the

703
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,240
various states

704
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,519
where the importers are located

705
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,000
thank

706
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,000
questions

707
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,038
you're so informative apparently you've

708
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,038
talked about everything

709
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,720
for the whole panel

710
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,639
[Applause]

711
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:17,359
