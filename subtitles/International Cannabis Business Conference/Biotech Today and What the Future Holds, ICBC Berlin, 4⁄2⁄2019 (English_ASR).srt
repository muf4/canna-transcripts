1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,500
so what would you start with a very very

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,450
quick real quick introductions to keep

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,160
this moving like hi under this comfy and

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,609
then we'll move into some other question

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,410
into conversation haunted some money was

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,330
then Adams and work with files file

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,109
sites where cannabis genomics company

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,118
may support United States

9
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:23,939
my name is irrational bunny on this DTO

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:27,179
africana we're at Ronald based biopharm

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,039
company located at the johnson johnson

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,710
innovation incubator jail absent he also

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,160
cultivate in colombia so we do R&amp;D and

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,160
cultivation my name is Sheldon Curtin I

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,549
would at the spot technologies founders

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,769
presidents we produce and processed

17
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,628
canvas in Edmonton Alberta Canada as a

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,489
licensed producer and we're currently

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:53,488
opening operations in Denmark in the UK

20
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:56,070
so so I'm missing a thing no question

21
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,619
here when when you see people in private

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,020
industry what exactly does that mean

23
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,669
does it mean research testing labs

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,300
doesn't mean testing doesn't mean

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,609
growing

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,429
does it mean formal entrance what

27
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,019
exactly does that mean I think it's

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,939
probably means something different all

29
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:21,890
of us and probably specific to what we

30
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:25,129
each do technology so when you see

31
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,689
Nestle what's separating the girls boys

32
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:31,469
if you want to do that time everything

33
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,669
guys I'd say more than the varieties

34
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,609
available in the market today

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,799
so the clear you like multi cars in five

36
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,228
years let me conclude that day totally

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,220
useless in the means when you say that

38
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:46,500
what do specific candidates Elvis never

39
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:51,420
undergone intensive breeding efforts and

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,209
so because of these ways that the loss

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,829
of change many biotechnology companies

42
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,569
including finalists which was collected

43
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:58,468
the motion of data on campus in the

44
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,478
world

45
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,188
canals you intensive breeding program so

46
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,989
we could read it in agronomy traits to

47
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,259
this point they're not just brief or

48
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,299
itcs

49
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,020
three four specific flowering times

50
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,629
specific cannabinoid levels you know of

51
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,090
course it's the baseline from me and all

52
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,799
my doing on that as well like they it's

53
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,950
the breeding for me acceptable rating

54
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,750
but also the formulations attached to

55
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:23,739
mrs. Weston three four so you know if

56
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,349
you want a different amount of

57
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,689
cannabinoids innocence it's um

58
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,750
CBG for instance you can breathe for the

59
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,969
CPG and you know what you said is true

60
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,069
sort of genetic stock market today will

61
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:37,750
probably also be a few years from now

62
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,159
just because of the amount of reading

63
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,039
that's work right now in reading for

64
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,689
specific neighborhood profiles what

65
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,629
happens then is in the population side

66
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,680
of things which is what we specialize in

67
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,689
it's important to realize that the

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,270
genetics really dictates which to pull

69
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:59,889
out as your ultimate fuel from that from

70
00:02:52,270 --> 00:03:01,450
that particular string or cultivar so

71
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,829
essentially the way I looked at last

72
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,839
night right now in this industry at

73
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,010
least is that it's really about what she

74
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,450
which in grower basically three four

75
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,250
then when she can pull out of that flex

76
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:17,049
and then formulate from the specific

77
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,789
compounds that you read work-related so

78
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,760
if you have a Landry strain which is

79
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:23,889
interested aren't landrace traits better

80
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,019
for what you can pull out of it than

81
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,250
turning to and that's that's what what

82
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,769
are what does that meet you in the

83
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,539
direction I would say that necessarily

84
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,159
and so they have unique send these

85
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,900
pathways that may be modern varieties

86
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,389
done so there's a lot to learn from that

87
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,120
but I would say that the interest of man

88
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,759
recent more mobility post anything else

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,349
waiting

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,479
production-wise with labor strains in

91
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,609
our community so they could take a break

92
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,500
on the flower they may produce very low

93
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,540
cannabinoid content

94
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,870
I'd say the games more about my ability

95
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:58,789
maybe the baseline for breeding programs

96
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,060
ladies weren't actually under tie

97
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:03,919
company or it was it was basically Asian

98
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,670
country musica Australia or New Zealand

99
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,438
or

100
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:09,318
from that part of the world who actually

101
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:12,229
had started to engage in trying to find

102
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,310
new land race across Asia and Latin

103
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:16,009
America

104
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,168
why would I completely do that because

105
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,339
they want to breathe air in medical side

106
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:21,889
of things want something to do that

107
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,509
again most unique subjects pathways that

108
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:27,129
don't exist in modern varieties so

109
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:29,478
violence my company we essentially

110
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,310
started as a property theater he's

111
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,199
seeing of Natural History in New York we

112
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,120
see once about a thousand land race

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,530
rides from over 80 different countries

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,870
but most of those were from the

115
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:40,339
University or barriers so they existed

116
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,360
pre-prohibition so they were formally

117
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:46,879
eighteen hundreds to the 19th century so

118
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,160
so what you guys are doing is basically

119
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:55,129
creating documentation and testing for

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,050
the cannabis formulations of tomorrow

121
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,418
whether that's your plant or whether

122
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,879
that's the liquid in your jar or the

123
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:05,029
stuff in your medical device or the

124
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,339
stuff in your so here basically you guys

125
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:11,509
are the formulations the foundations of

126
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:13,219
that industry right yes so I to answer

127
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:17,329
your previous question of what I think

128
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,830
of the biotech industries what people

129
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:20,779
there's a big misconception in this

130
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:24,469
initiative guy when a jurisdiction is

131
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:26,239
legal and go that's natural it equals a

132
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:31,039
safe and effective product that's not

133
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,019
the case so for me keep it simple so for

134
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,819
an example could be that you can have an

135
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,639
oil teacher sitting on a shelf right now

136
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:39,199
for medical patients and you don't know

137
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,689
if there is stability testing on that

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,430
product so meaning that that product is

139
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:45,348
actually stable for the past ten months

140
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,840
if the cannabinoid content is still

141
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:48,918
there if it's not decorated but even if

142
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,408
it could be toxic

143
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:52,859
there's not real testing really done in

144
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,688
the industry not something that

145
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,120
kind of bridge - yeah and that's why the

146
00:05:54,689 --> 00:06:00,840
medical community has not as in Seoul

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,759
distant or open-minded - you know

148
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,158
prescribing medical cannabis for

149
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,680
patients and you know bringing that

150
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:09,709
education is plagued requires data and

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
rigorous testing we need to do

152
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:14,489
formulation where you need to do you see

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,500
where QA work you need to do analytical

154
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,478
test preclinical testing eventually

155
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,000
individual testing this is the type of

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,908
stuff that at a basic level we need to

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,589
bridge that gap between the medical for

158
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:28,889
medical community from a physician

159
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:29,929
perspective as well as the patient

160
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,629
perspective

161
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,728
let's save cannabis innovation is of

162
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:37,729
mass law higher kid needs than breeding

163
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:41,158
the baseline of that period in that

164
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:43,258
formulation go up tonight that's right a

165
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:45,180
math test and that's what you're getting

166
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,939
at is the testing really that proves the

167
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,769
accuracy of those tamarins that you're

168
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,800
save reading for and we're reading for

169
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:54,060
and then testing in the labs which is so

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,500
important because really what you're

171
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,629
really what we're trying to do in the

172
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,848
end you trusting and highly ethical

173
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,080
focus is making sure that what we

174
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,939
produce in the middle market has a

175
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,680
formulation of work flour even on

176
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,110
certain markets or campuses to be the

177
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,060
formulation it's important to make sure

178
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,620
that the patient is getting you know

179
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,968
come today they're looking for and

180
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,329
really dynamics down to the camera

181
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:16,379
quality flower or robot formulation and

182
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:19,019
of course the stability of that

183
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,539
formulation this is very fascinating and

184
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:24,709
but I'm the next question is how would

185
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,878
you guys say this ties into things like

186
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:29,068
GMP now for those of you who don't know

187
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,810
what GMP is right it says it's a

188
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,000
standard here in Europe that applies to

189
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,278
it's good manufacturing practice and

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,129
it's like a seed to sale quality test

191
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:41,908
how does what you guys do tie into that

192
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:44,789
discussion it creates a standard global

193
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:46,588
standard that you know when you're

194
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:48,718
following certain types of protocols and

195
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:49,528
practices and as a cultivator in

196
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,750
Colombia

197
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:53,939
there is a stigma around the Colombian

198
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,088
market but when you say you're like for

199
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,650
us where we're G ACP going to be G AP so

200
00:07:57,088 --> 00:08:00,538
good agricultural practices so we're

201
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,948
going to be Agri we're going to be

202
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:03,209
producing these products with these

203
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,000
international standards and then

204
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:06,269
manufacturing them with GMP standards as

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,860
well

206
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:10,049
it creates some sort of level of comfort

207
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,240
and a level of sophistication because

208
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,740
you could say I'm a cultivator in

209
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Colombia and you will some people might

210
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,920
think you're growing in the jungle and

211
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,870
you know I was like an illegal market

212
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,939
but that's not the case right there's a

213
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,610
lot of it adds that that prestigious

214
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,439
level and and creates a high quality of

215
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,530
the the active pharmaceutical ingredient

216
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,269
that we treat the cannabinoids us okay

217
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,919
so I'm gonna I'm also trying to get some

218
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,909
reaction from the audience can I have a

219
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:39,029
hands up who in the audience is actively

220
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,100
engaged in this kind of environment or

221
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:46,110
this kind of activity in Europe is there

222
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:47,790
anybody in the room if you if we can get

223
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,899
a microphone to you are you hearing

224
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:53,129
things from the folks here from

225
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:55,079
non-european sources and I know you your

226
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:57,990
global as well but what I'm curious

227
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,970
about is how this discussion has

228
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,560
differed so far from the conversation in

229
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:11,970
Europe on these because do you have any

230
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:14,759
insight on that well do thank you it's

231
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,310
hard to give an estimate over here since

232
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,429
there's very very few companies who do

233
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:23,399
do so or specialize in its kind of R&amp;D

234
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:25,169
activities don't take this for granted

235
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,840
maybe I just don't know about all the

236
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:30,000
companies that are active in this field

237
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:33,000
however what we're focusing on is fairly

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,470
similar to what you guys do so I think

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,419
it's in a way on par on par so so do you

240
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,029
think I'm gonna bounce this back so cuz

241
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,909
my spirit is sitting here this seems to

242
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,740
be the groundwork all the next certainly

243
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:48,750
the medical discussion right so if a

244
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,450
doctor knows that they're prescribing

245
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,679
this brand that is proven to be stable

246
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,670
and you've gone through the tests and

247
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,669
it's treated like a pharmaceutical

248
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:58,259
that's that's a great discussion but

249
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,939
then there's the flip side and those of

250
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,210
us in the room who are older than

251
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,120
probably 35 remember this Hardwell fear

252
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,910
that sort of came out of the old timey

253
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,070
or industry of like oh my God my strain

254
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,870
is gonna be bought up by Monsanto to

255
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,180
name one company and they're gonna rule

256
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,610
the world and then cannabis is going to

257
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,000
go into another strain controlled world

258
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,778
and how scary

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,470
I guess uh so when when you're talking

260
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:30,198
about types of specific indications that

261
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,860
people are suffering from and you know

262
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:36,679
they're already using different types of

263
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,600
pharmaceutical products right so in in

264
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,088
in our field we we take it very

265
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,889
seriously as well so there has to be a

266
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,110
level of sophistication you don't want

267
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:46,970
to give someone an oil to ensure that

268
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,459
you say oh this oil to ensure works for

269
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,129
epilepsy and they have a bad reaction so

270
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,929
this is why you treat it at this serious

271
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:56,930
level it's a social responsibility for

272
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:59,838
everyone who's in this space as as much

273
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:01,609
as it it people you know think it's a

274
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,629
very it's a new economy that's being

275
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,199
built and it's a very interesting

276
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:08,539
fast-growing industry but you still need

277
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,979
to have that responsibility that if you

278
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:12,980
are gonna put products out there that

279
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,569
they should be properly tested I agree

280
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,839
entirely I think the global reputation

281
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:18,378
is on all of our shoulders right now

282
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,629
well that's my question

283
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,129
I mean it is it being really regulated I

284
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,050
mean certainly in Europe if you're if

285
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,300
you're a medical product if you're a

286
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:27,859
pharmaceutical product there are testing

287
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,389
and other things that go along with it

288
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,389
that are mainstreamed into this

289
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,799
discussion is this regulation discussion

290
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,688
saying that on the biotech front

291
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,549
certainly in the American hemisphere

292
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:42,110
what you guys are doing is ahead of the

293
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:43,429
regulation I mean that for for me being

294
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,769
in this industry for about three and a

295
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:47,448
half years the European market feels

296
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:52,730
like Canada three and a half years ago

297
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:54,469
so it we are trying to look the good

298
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,379
thing about being in Canada as well and

299
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,079
being based in in in Canada's from being

300
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:02,839
the first g7 company to our country to

301
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,688
to legalize marijuana for not just

302
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,910
medicinal but recreational the one good

303
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:09,708
thing is that we could do R&amp;D at a

304
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:11,269
federal level and we can do clinical

305
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,458
trials at a federal level so these are

306
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,519
Health Canada approved testing that you

307
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:18,818
know has a level of sophistication

308
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,558
globally in the US unfortunately

309
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:23,448
cannabis is not considered it's

310
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:25,458
considered a controlled drug so it's

311
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:29,389
illegal from a federal level which

312
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:30,799
limits the Americans to do any Rd and

313
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,860
clinical development so they can't

314
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,990
necessarily generate real actual data at

315
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,980
market that data or use that data in

316
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:43,070
their in in their production or on Rd so

317
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,350
in Germany what I've noticed is now is

318
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:49,670
like because it's such a young ingenue

319
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:51,440
yang industry here or in Europe I should

320
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,909
say that it's so growing and it's in the

321
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,580
early stages there's a lot of room for

322
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:57,889
growth and to add that level of

323
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,410
sophistication just makes it that much

324
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:02,779
better for medical practitioners in

325
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:04,850
Europe to bridge that gap and be more

326
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,220
comfortable prescribing medical cannabis

327
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,560
so I'm gonna push this one again and

328
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,710
come back to you Meowth where is there

329
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:15,019
is another example of the industry being

330
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,680
ahead of the regulatory environment or

331
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:21,049
when you call cannabis say a medical

332
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,609
product does it slot into the testing

333
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:24,829
environment even in the United States

334
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,600
even before federal reform because

335
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,950
there's something called the FDA this is

336
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,750
their narcotic it will probably a

337
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,180
schedule 2 I mean all those things are

338
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,070
coming I'm gonna go back quickly to the

339
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:37,069
intellectual property and GMP factors

340
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,660
because I think that GMP first off you

341
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,250
know good manufacturing practices for

342
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,079
the European Union which is essentially

343
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,990
at least right now in the cannabis

344
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,040
industry the highest level you know it's

345
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,740
similar to what you might do in a

346
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:51,439
pharmaceutical industry that's I believe

347
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,029
important because if you focus on that

348
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,200
and you're you're manufacturing to that

349
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,839
level you're gonna always get a

350
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,009
consistent product for the patient which

351
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,960
means you're gonna of course be able to

352
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:01,039
provide things like the stability data

353
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,139
and other things that I personally

354
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,480
believe is important if you're selling a

355
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:07,939
medical product you can do that with

356
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,529
flour even but it just it just takes

357
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,090
time basically proving that stability

358
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,529
but is important if you have the right

359
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,660
flour then you can still potentially

360
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,839
make that the right medicine now

361
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:20,779
intellectual property a whole complex

362
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,700
ball I should say basically because it's

363
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:25,189
very it's kind of difficult to register

364
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,680
certain things like cultivars in fact in

365
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,200
the US it's what's what's a cultivar a

366
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,539
cultivar is a strain it's just the

367
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,759
proper way to say it so the scientific

368
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:37,069
term would be cultivar the black market

369
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,600
called it a strain but actually if you

370
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,400
talk to any of my breeders they say

371
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,220
cultivar and they'd actually but just

372
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,230
anybody over like 35 sister okay it's a

373
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,460
stranger in a strange strain or first

374
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,470
more it's like bacteria

375
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,750
so exactly strains actually a plant

376
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,639
virus so so cultivar is a little bit

377
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,839
more you know if I can get everyone here

378
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,899
certain cultivar that's what I'm gonna

379
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,570
do variety work to it's a variety yeah

380
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,528
that works but so intellectual property

381
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,330
is something that's very hard to

382
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:05,600
register when it comes to plants the

383
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,700
Monsanto model a bit of an odd model but

384
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,709
they did pretty good at it but if you

385
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,050
look at some other companies that that

386
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,059
are doing similar things what they do is

387
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:16,069
effectively they register plant breeders

388
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,079
rights which takes a plant breeders

389
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,180
permit which takes someone who has at

390
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,879
least 15 or so years of experience in

391
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:24,169
plant breeding which is rare so if you

392
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,088
can combine these two things and

393
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:28,278
essentially find someone who can do that

394
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,800
then register those strains and then

395
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,838
manufacture that a GMP level that's

396
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,569
essentially the future of cultivation at

397
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,920
least in in my in my books when it comes

398
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,379
to formulation there's a whole nother

399
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,639
aspect of intellectual property and of

400
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:42,879
course the efficacy of all those

401
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,289
different formulations it's a nice

402
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,490
you're a wealth of information okay so

403
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:48,889
I'm gonna jump in with one of those

404
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,709
stupid questions okay so so why would I

405
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,230
go ahead and register my strain I don't

406
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,849
know excuse me it's my cultivar if I'm

407
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,519
going to go ahead and just like have a

408
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,170
like a processed something which is

409
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,539
obviously has to be tested and whatever

410
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,769
but if I'm just going to be making

411
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:05,419
liquids or something from that and

412
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,370
mixing and matching or whatever

413
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:10,549
certainly if I'm out of the medical

414
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,440
space I mean we're just I mean I

415
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:15,049
understand to a certain extent why this

416
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,089
is important but again to my question

417
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,740
where are the people telling you guys

418
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,029
what to do whether regulations or are

419
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,528
you guys doing this as you're going

420
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:23,750
along which is not necessarily a bad

421
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:27,439
thing but where is that and get a good

422
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,970
lawyer but I mean you know really it's

423
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,230
it's it's just it's very hard to

424
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,759
actually register some of these things

425
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,589
it's actually more like a process patent

426
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,149
it's not so much of protecting the

427
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:36,410
formulation itself and then of course

428
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:38,139
there's the trademarks in the brand

429
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:40,069
associated to that particular product

430
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,199
that's probably the key takeaway from

431
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,350
that that's that's your IP really not so

432
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,079
much that you've just combined CBD and

433
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,000
and some particular you know flavonoid

434
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,769
or something so it's it's really about

435
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,059
the process of how you derive that then

436
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,379
how did you put it together and then if

437
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,750
you can protect that in some way that's

438
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,789
that's a way to secure some IP and even

439
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,200
in the u.s. it's a way to secure IP in a

440
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:02,149
place where it's not

441
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,950
completely federally legal and Europe

442
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,139
you can do it as well it's just only in

443
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,299
certain places right now because THC you

444
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,740
can't work within certain countries okay

445
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,599
so I didn't do a quick hands up I'm

446
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,578
gonna keep you active all right hands up

447
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,529
in the audience who is kind of like

448
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:17,209
bugged I mean not like you know a

449
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:20,149
professional and you know whatever but

450
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,220
just as visceral level who is bugged you

451
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,860
need to time out I said it no I'm crazy

452
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,078
bugged by this whole conversation man

453
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,269
awesome so there's one so hands up who

454
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,849
is bugged by this conversation ends up

455
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:36,559
or is p4 this sleep sleeping who is like

456
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:38,509
profoundly worried right now about the

457
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,579
fact that private companies no offense

458
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:44,150
cuz these guys are really smart private

459
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:46,730
companies are creating IP this is

460
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,070
intellectual property is protected by in

461
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:52,099
cannabis hands-on well they're a couple

462
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:54,230
why I'll tell you why it's the old

463
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:56,179
hippie of me first of all cannabis has

464
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:21,160
been decentralized for a very long time

465
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:23,810
right it's 257 these sort of things

466
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,390
sometimes seem to me to be the opposite

467
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,309
of how cannabis culture has evolved and

468
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,470
I understand that the world changes and

469
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,319
I understand that business is business

470
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,569
but how do you patent a plant what's

471
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:36,950
gonna stop people from saying like I

472
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:38,299
said you have to grow these seeds you

473
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,160
have to buy these seeds from us all the

474
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:44,329
time I'm surprisingly I'm actually very

475
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,330
anti capitalist but to make the hippie

476
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:49,339
here modern very happy we actually think

477
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:51,049
we've collected about now three thousand

478
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:52,009
or sequence of the DNA of about three

479
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,710
thousand plants from eighty four

480
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:56,539
countries to date and that most of that

481
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,940
data has been uploaded to the open

482
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:03,200
canvas project and the NCBI

483
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,930
so we are currently fighting utility

484
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,940
patents and creating data space to fight

485
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,460
future utility patents what's a utility

486
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,009
patent it's just a broad scoping patent

487
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,419
on a particular plan

488
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:15,519
Shelburne I'm actually probably like

489
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:18,850
I've got I've got the I've got the

490
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,259
strain and you can't use it but

491
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,519
varieties like the og cush trainwreck

492
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,839
things that we're on the market today

493
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:27,579
can never be patented and they never

494
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,839
will be nor should they be no no no make

495
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:31,210
it quick go ahead go ahead

496
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:34,028
so there's a there's a landmark US

497
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:37,090
Patent Office ruling I think the 2013

498
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:40,179
ruling its myriad versus someone else

499
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:43,418
that basically says that anything that's

500
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:46,480
natural anything any plant or anything

501
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:49,690
any DNA that any genetics that existed

502
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,870
naturally cannot be patented but if you

503
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:56,259
have if you have modified the genetics

504
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:58,648
in the lab you can patent that so

505
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:01,720
anything that existed up until now

506
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:04,209
naturally cannot be patented the process

507
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,528
to extract to do whatever you want to do

508
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,829
can be patented

509
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:10,778
but the genetics itself cannot be and

510
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:12,879
everybody in the world pretty much uses

511
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:15,759
that that's ruling which was a big

512
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,409
Supreme Court case in 2013 so so my

513
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,269
question then is so what you guys are

514
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,010
doing well important and cool and like

515
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:24,429
the land race discussion is awesome

516
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:26,230
right is what you're doing really for

517
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,659
the pharmaceutical market I mean I can

518
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,899
certainly see an application or is this

519
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:34,210
really for the recreational folks who

520
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:37,178
are like you know what this is my beer

521
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,880
this is my gin this is my cigarette this

522
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:41,649
is my data I mean where do you really

523
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,899
see this being applied the commercial

524
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:46,269
recreational space or medical and be

525
00:20:43,898 --> 00:20:49,298
honest specifically for philo so it's

526
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:50,889
both medical and recreational that's why

527
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:54,308
we're in multiple markets today from

528
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,669
Canada Colombia Spain all the United

529
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:55,898
States

530
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,850
I'd say it's both in that sense

531
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:59,500
pharmaceutical will definitely be larger

532
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:02,829
market in the future and that's where

533
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,019
breeding for novel cannabinoids will

534
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:06,460
come into play but I'd say a recreation

535
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,158
is still a big part of it as well too

536
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,630
I mean I have to agree I mean I look at

537
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,669
what happened in Canada with with

538
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,289
legalization there's I think the

539
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:15,990
recreational is in the future probably

540
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:19,720
going to be a big part of the market

541
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,370
Atlas is focused on medical so because

542
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,839
we focus on the formulations and and the

543
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:24,419
efficacy of those formulations that's

544
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,059
that's really where we

545
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,920
where we focus our efforts but I do see

546
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,629
a huge opportunity in the recreational

547
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,700
markets and I think a company like yours

548
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,050
is gonna do very well with that well I'm

549
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,029
gonna throw another one in here okay so

550
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,930
those of you who are in Europe know

551
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:41,190
about this whole novel foods discussion

552
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,840
right so if you guys are like

553
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,519
registering all these strains for those

554
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,339
of you don't know what novel foods is

555
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,109
the European Union has regulations that

556
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,480
say that any plant-based material and

557
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:53,039
you can if you know better definition

558
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,220
please criticize me later but basically

559
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,269
the European Union says that any

560
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,390
plant-based material that makes its way

561
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:03,089
into human food that is was not in

562
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,950
common use before believe 1997 has to go

563
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:08,669
through a special regulation process and

564
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:10,769
of course CBD in particular in food

565
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:14,519
right now is falling into that

566
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:16,319
discussion across Europe so how is what

567
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:17,970
you guys are doing and maybe if you

568
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,549
don't know that's fine how is what you

569
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,860
guys are doing going to help or aid or

570
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:26,220
hold back or hinder that novel food

571
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,959
discussion here in the EU let me speak

572
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,329
to that because I think that for us

573
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,370
being able to infuse are isolated

574
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:34,169
compounds proven compounds that we know

575
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:35,549
are consistent and dosed properly is a

576
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,370
huge part of what would make people

577
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,589
comfortable having an infused product of

578
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:42,719
any sort be it a beverage or a you know

579
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:44,250
an edible product and I think that for

580
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,930
Europe having this big debate right now

581
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,579
with regards to CBD and how it should be

582
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,160
produced and and how it should be

583
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,689
distributed I think it's important that

584
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,250
being a something that many people

585
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,750
consider medical and I personally

586
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,920
consider medical it's important that it

587
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,619
goes through the right processing the

588
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,210
checks and balances to make sure that

589
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:02,459
what you purchase is actually what you

590
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,350
get and I guess that's that's an issue

591
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,299
I've seen in a lot of places including

592
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,679
in some parts of the US where where

593
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:10,289
there's less regulatory environment and

594
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,750
you get a product and in fact we tested

595
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,119
30 products CBD products or claimed to

596
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,859
be a CBD and out of 30 there was

597
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,899
actually just a fraction that even

598
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:20,129
contains CBD and only three that

599
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,830
actually had the amount that they said

600
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,330
they did so to me that regulatory

601
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:26,490
environment that's going to oversee

602
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:28,649
what's going to be an infused product is

603
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,140
is important and how it was produced and

604
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,890
is it clean is a real that's also

605
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,400
important okay so so any questions from

606
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,640
the audience

607
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:45,170
any thoughts okay there's one over here

608
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:48,299
I have a question

609
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:51,269
when do strengths you develop but they

610
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:55,170
can cross in nature with the original

611
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:58,859
hemp strains so we can see it in the

612
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:02,519
corn industry or corn farming but the

613
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:05,909
natural strains no more exists in the

614
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:09,240
world because the artificial strains

615
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:12,120
crushed in the fields with the natural

616
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,480
strains and so the natural strains they

617
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:18,599
have been here maybe 30 years ago you

618
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:23,849
can never find in the planet anymore and

619
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:28,558
I'm afraid that this danger will expand

620
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:32,699
worldwide with a hemp - and the old wise

621
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:36,178
plant our hemp will disappear from

622
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,330
plamen planet great I totally agree with

623
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:42,059
you and I think preserving seed

624
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:45,418
diversity particularly in cannabis is

625
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:47,460
same thing is very important during the

626
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,900
20th century we saw a massive decline in

627
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,860
the diversity of seeds available which

628
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,769
is what you're speaking about

629
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:55,558
I think only maybe 10% of the original

630
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:57,329
varieties that existed a hundred years

631
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:01,700
ago are still available today there's

632
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,699
only one kind of banana damn-near I know

633
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,889
we have to avoid monoculture and I think

634
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,808
part of what

635
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,620
Philo's has done at least with working

636
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:09,240
with the American Museum of Natural

637
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:11,189
History on a project called the cannabis

638
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,980
evolution project is about identifying

639
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,390
and then preserving the seed diversity

640
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,890
and so that's actually where small

641
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,630
growers around the world will come in

642
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,429
and they will be the powerhouses that

643
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,620
preserve this diversity of cannabis we

644
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:25,110
see today which absolutely needs to

645
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,189
exist in and as we move ever forward we

646
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:28,109
have to remember where we came from

647
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,940
always and I couldn't agree more

648
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,798
honestly about preserving those strains

649
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,840
and making sure that first off the

650
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,889
breeders the the jedis of the industry

651
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,298
that have been around forever that

652
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,640
they've they've really been the ones who

653
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:39,900
have defined the industry today and it's

654
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,280
important that they're recognized and

655
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,690
that's where these these strains and

656
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,460
strain names and other things cannabis

657
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,070
and hemp really it's important to

658
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,600
recognize who originally brought these

659
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:50,339
to the market who's been producing these

660
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,928
and and then we don't forget that

661
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:52,178
because we don't want to wind up in a

662
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:54,820
city

663
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,559
where everything goes away like bananas

664
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,759
for instance you know which you're right

665
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:58,960
they are gonna go away at some point

666
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,849
well that was my question about the

667
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,649
regulatory environment I mean think it

668
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:07,928
is lagging and those are issues

669
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:10,628
obviously so the next question yes early

670
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:15,580
this year a team from Berkeley have used

671
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:20,709
synthetic biology to produce purified to

672
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:24,970
each C and CBD using yeast has has

673
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:28,659
vector so I'm wondering how you has

674
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:32,740
traditional breeder are considering

675
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:37,419
these successful new advanced which will

676
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:39,638
be one of many others in the next year I

677
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:41,259
mean I think we also Raphael mushrooms

678
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:44,528
talked yesterday at least I hope we did

679
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:46,058
I think it's impossible to get those

680
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:49,509
East genetically engineered East

681
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:51,730
varieties to produce the same level of

682
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:54,069
compounds that cannabis can today talk

683
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:58,089
to the research kings in Dortmund

684
00:26:54,069 --> 00:27:00,999
Germany well they were talking about I

685
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:02,918
mean just producing THC cannabis is the

686
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:06,159
whole entourage effects actually just as

687
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,080
THC is the CBD the CPG the CDA and the

688
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,519
mercy the blah-blah-blah-blah cost to

689
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,839
produce those isolates from yeast is

690
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,019
extraordinary it's absurd to do that

691
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:21,519
might as well just grow a girl weed

692
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:23,230
first yeah yeah okay I think no sorry

693
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,759
the boss says no I'm sorry but of course

694
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,618
as always you can all huddle in the

695
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,868
hallway and have heated debate and

696
00:27:26,618 --> 00:27:31,209
discussion and coffee we thank you very

697
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:34,819
much let's hear Thank You Sheldon in a

698
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,880
rush and Marguerite's

699
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,879
