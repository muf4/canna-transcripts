for coming uh so today's presentations

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,600
is like intended to talk a little bit

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
about data and not just data um for a

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,778
sake of talking about data but data that

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,100
we actually know exists

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,739
um but before we get started I really

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,480
want to thank all the uh organizers from

14
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,858
ICPC this has been a really great

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,960
conference this is actually our third

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,480
year here I also want to thank the the

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,280

getting us prepared for for this and

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,520
then I also want to thank all of you

20
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,398
again too for all the great panel

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,559
discussions and uh and and uh

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,120
experiences that have been shared uh

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,038
yesterday and I'm sure there's gonna be

24
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,378
more today in fact as we've been

25
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,520
listening to everybody talk this uh last

26
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:55,019
couple of days

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,760
um it's really started to solidify some

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,120
of the thinking that we have around what

29
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,899
the potential is uh here uh in Europe

30
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:07,019
for a larger scale commercial Market

31
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,260
that includes more medical sales and

32
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:13,019
also at some point adult use sales so

33
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,400
this is the agenda we're going to first

34
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,579
of all just kind of talk a little bit

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,740
about my background and some of the work

36
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,379
that we've done creating centralized

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,579
supply chain data and then we're going

38
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,560
to talk a little bit more about how that

39
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,780
data actually gets transitioned into

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,060
actionable insights we'll actually share

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,460
a little bit of information from inside

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,840
the system that we utilize and then

43
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:38,039
transition some of that into some

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
thinking about how that might actually

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,380
look here in Germany and then start to

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,320
maybe prognost a little prognosticate a

47
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,899
little bit on what a market here might

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,459
look like in Germany

49
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,618
so

50
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,978
um I know and we've heard it like quite

51
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:59,459
a few times uh this week uh that there's

52
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:02,640
like I think a a sense of disappointment

53
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,519
um and skepticism around the path that

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,280
Germany has charted for itself

55
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,719
especially since April of this year when

56
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,520
we all were kind of thinking this time

57
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,199
last year when I was presenting at the

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,780
same conference that there was this

59
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,598
potential for a very large German Market

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,000
that would then also start to encourage

61
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,519
other member states within the EU to

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,979
take up more canvas policy but after

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,439
April I think everyone and like our we

64
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,539
took a hard look at it too saw this big

65
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,520
Market potential which we knew was going

66
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,378
to be challenging really shrink and

67
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,540
almost get kicked down the road a little

68
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,159
ways where we were really starting to

69
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,318
get concerned about how soon this was

70
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,659
was going to happen and so my background

71
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,659
so you know is is both in government

72
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,359
service but also uh in the private

73
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,219
sector and in government service I was

74
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,819
the director of the Colorado marijuana

75
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:56,759
enforcement division in 2013 going into

76
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:59,098
2014 when we first started adult use

77
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,799
legalized sales there in the country

78
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:04,738
and at the time we had really three

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,080
goals uh that were preoccupying our

80
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,759
thinking the first one was to do

81
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,400
everything we could to disrupt the

82
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,519
illicit market and then supplant that

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,219
illicit Market with a viable commercial

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,340
Market that could produce a much safer

85
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,719
product at at scale to Consumers and

86
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,459
then the third one which was not

87
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,340
unimportant but was we wanted to limit

88
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,080
the amount of exposure that children had

89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,900
to cannabis products whether they were

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,440
illicit products or commercialized

91
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,959
products and so that was back in 2013

92
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,680
going into 2014. those are the exact

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,840
same goals that we see we keep here get

94
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,519
repeated by countries that are

95
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,658
contemplating more permissive cannabis

96
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,360
policy

97
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,280
and so now since that time we've been

98
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,680
part of and I've been part of close to

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,959
two dozen different implementations of

100
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,340
cannabis policy and as we've seen it

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,219
played out we've seen a lot of different

102
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,319
approaches to that cannabis policy and

103
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,539
uh we

104
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,579
um have seen a lot of successes and a

105
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,519
lot of failures but when we lay over all

106
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,760
that experience over the pathway that

107
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,000
German Germany has stated we still see a

108
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:18,599
viable path forward for a commercial

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,519
Market at scale that can be done within

110
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,460
the confines of a scientific framework

111
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,680
that would help

112
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,359
not only address some of the the

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,720
concerns and the goals the government

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,620
has for legalization but to actually

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,000
build sustainable investable Marketplace

116
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,399
for cannabis in here which is great news

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,779
I think for everybody in the the room

118
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,239
who's really focused on kind of the

119
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,799
business side of this

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,040
so what I'm going to do today is I'm

121
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,259
going to use supply chain data to kind

122
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,939
of illustrate

123
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,160
and substantiate some of the things that

124
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,740
we think could be like outlined as

125
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,620
success factors for countries in Europe

126
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,500
to follow based on kind of what we know

127
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,519
from from other marketplaces

128
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,240
so sticking with the nostalgic look back

129
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,978
on my experiences in in government

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,819
when we first started regulating

131
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:16,079
cannabis uh in 2013 and 2014 for adult

132
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,579
use

133
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:22,918
um in Colorado we were we were cons we

134
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:24,899
were we were like aware of the fact that

135
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,519
there was a dearth of data that was

136
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,019
available in fact one of the first

137
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,060
things we started to realize is that

138
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,459
there were massive gaps in data where

139
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,079
people assumed there would be data so

140
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,239
for example we assumed that there was

141
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,698
data that existed already on youth

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,680
consumption rates or driving under the

143
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:45,780
under the influence of cannabis or

144
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,400
testing data Etc there was just like

145
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,918
what we what we learned is that that

146
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,859
data hadn't been collected at all during

147
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,560
the uh prior to adult use legalization

148
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,840
and so as a as a as a state and as a

149
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,899
government

150
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,939
we we became hyper focused on trying to

151
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,859
collect the right data to be able to

152
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:08,000
inform the market and we realized at

153
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,560
that time that we were going to have to

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,538
recreate the data structures to collect

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,519
the data and start all over with brand

156
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,079
new Baseline data which is probably to

157
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,060
some extent true in a lot of the

158
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,459
countries here in Europe

159
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,319
we are also cognizantly aware of the

160
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,180
fact that the industry was brand new

161
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,919
it's not what it didn't have the same

162
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,620
appearance that it does in a lot of ways

163
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,799
today it wasn't uncommon at all for us

164
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,780
to see handwritten labels

165
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,160
um on on on products that were being

166
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,219
sold at retail

167
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,479
um it wasn't uncommon we actually saw

168
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,280
concentrate production done in slow

169
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,740
cookers we call them crock pots in the

170
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,978
U.S or washing machines they did we saw

171
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,439
cold water extraction of of cannabis

172
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,899
concentrates in older washing machines

173
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,180
uh and and then we also saw packaging

174
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,739
that was probably more similar to what

175
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,439
you would see at a high school bake sale

176
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,538
than an actual retail Marketplace and so

177
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,639
there was a lot of business aptitudes

178
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,259
that just didn't exist at the time and

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,019
so we knew that this would be

180
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,400
challenging for this new Marketplace to

181
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,978
in the in the actors within the

182
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,019
marketplace to actually be able to

183
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,300
comply with a comprehensive set of

184
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,339
regulations so we we needed a tool we

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,220
needed a tool to have some visibility

186
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,198
into to the supply chain and we needed a

187
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,340
tool to help start collecting data so

188
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,319
that we could describe what was

189
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,418
happening in the marketplace to the

190
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,800
population writ large to demonstrate

191
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:30,299
that there was some credit bill and then

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,180
also be able to compare and contrast

193
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,160
some of that data to Showcase what was

194
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,319
happening in the industry we also were

195
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,300
really cognizant of the fact that

196
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,660
government success in this area of

197
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,038
public policy is indelibly tied to the

198
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,360
business success and so we wanted to

199
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,879
make sure that the tools were available

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,979
for small medium-sized businesses to be

201
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,019
able to comply what we landed on was

202
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:54,659
supply chain track excuse me supply

203
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,939
chain tracking and just a quick little

204
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,680
overview of how that works in almost

205
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,560
every supply chain tracking system

206
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,780
there's a physical tag that goes on

207
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,918
every plant

208
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:06,779
that follows that plant all the way

209
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,339
through its life cycle all the way up

210
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:10,258
until the point where it gets harvested

211
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:12,000
and then as the plant material is

212
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,680
packaged into other things like trimmed

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,779
to go to a manufacturer for concentrate

214
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,720
Productions or testing batches going to

215
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,119
testing facilities or buds go going to

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,400
storefront

217
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,819
all those those products get packaged

218
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,978
and they get transported to various

219
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,300
other license premises and it's tracked

220
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,759
all the way through the supply chain and

221
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,799
all of those data events are collected

222
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,958
from the time it's a little baby plant

223
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,879
all the way to the time it's sold at the

224
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,098
point of sale so every movement from one

225
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,799
room to the next the date of the Harvest

226
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,540
how much the yields were the results of

227
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,599
the tests how much it sold for at

228
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:51,899
wholesale how long it takes to transport

229
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,639
it to a a facility and then how much

230
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,620
it's sold for at the point of sale those

231
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,659
things and everything else is collected

232
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,360
along the entire supply chain so

233
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:02,338
government has transparency into what

234
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,919
the the licensed Community or the

235
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,459
regulated Community is reporting in and

236
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,139
businesses then can uh

237
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,419
um if the government chooses to can see

238
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,399
a lot of the aggregated data from the

239
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,159
supply chain to help make strong

240
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,139
business decisions going forward

241
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,278
so to illustrate this a little bit

242
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,100
further we're going to talk a little bit

243
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,379
more about some of the actionable data

244
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,259
that comes from uh having a centralized

245
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:31,080
platform where many of the stakeholders

246
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,240
within the Cannabis uh

247
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,980
um many stakeholders within the Cannabis

248
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,839
industry co-create value with one

249
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,860
another and so what we've done is we've

250
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,620
created what we would call like a sample

251
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,659
jurisdiction or fictional jurisdiction

252
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,700
to demonstrate some of uh what you can

253
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,199
see in our system and I'm going to start

254
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,540
with two slides that are going to be the

255
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,620
bookends of the supply chain one is is

256
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:57,958
like how much cannabis is output by a

257
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,720
particular Market followed by what does

258
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,759
adequate to in sales and so think of

259
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,100
this as a if if you're trying to like

260
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,080
frame the size of the sample Market that

261
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,879
we've created for you think of it as a

262
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,580
state that's somewhere between 10 to 12

263
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,679
million people in population

264
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,019
that has a long-standing medical program

265
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,099
and an adult use program that's been

266
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,659
ramping up since around uh 2019 for the

267
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,278
First full year and what you can see

268
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,679
here kind of looking a couple of years

269
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,559
after this Market's really been up and

270
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,319
running that the commercial Market takes

271
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:35,039
time to be able to supply all of the

272
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:39,480
inputs into the product categories so in

273
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:41,699
2020 we are at 181 metric tons in our in

274
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,300
our sample Market by the time we got to

275
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,459
2022 we were closer to 925 metric tons

276
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,139
so if you put that into perspective you

277
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,759
know the how cup study that was here

278
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:53,519
done here in Germany where they

279
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,980
estimated it at 400 metric tons this is

280
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,620
a market of like 10 to 12 million and

281
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,259
we're seeing something closer to 920

282
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,759
metric tons of cannabis produced and

283
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,100
there's a lot of reasons why there might

284
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,740
that might be it might be that that

285
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,899
edible products or concentrates take up

286
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,959
a big part of the marketplace which also

287
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,339
takes up more plant material and many

288
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,899
other different things but I think what

289
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,959
the the most important thing to

290
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:21,240
understand is that even if and this kind

291
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,099
of gets to my Unapologetic optimism

292
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,959
around what could happen here in Germany

293
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,800
is even if

294
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:31,919
uh Germany were to legalize today and

295
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,620
intend on having their initial sales uh

296
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,939
start January 1st of 2024. there is no

297
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,919
way that even the full-scale

298
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,180
legalization model would be able to

299
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,399
accommodate

300
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,500
um the demand for cannabis uh here in

301
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,600
Germany on day one it's going to take a

302
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,399
matter of years for that to be able uh

303
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,560
to ramp up and so when we think about

304
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,440
that in the context of Social Clubs and

305
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:55,619
model projects they could potentially

306
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,120
produce if done well and at scale in a

307
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,339
sizable enough market of somewhere

308
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,560
around five to ten twelve million people

309
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,300
uh the German of the German Market they

310
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,599
could actually like potentially produce

311
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:09,059
a fair amount of of the product for the

312
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,278
entire demand in Germany so to kind of

313
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,599
put this in perspective I think a lot of

314
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,820
times and again I know this is a little

315
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,339
self-serving because I have such close

316
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,839
ties to the Colorado model but it's

317
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,260
considered to be one of the more mature

318
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,579
Market places in the world for cannabis

319
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:26,100
and even though it's been fully

320
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,919
legalized for a number of years now

321
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,899
since 2014 when the first sales began

322
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,240
less than half of the local

323
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,120
jurisdictions in the state of Colorado

324
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,278
allow for cannabis commercialized

325
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,019
operations within the state and if you

326
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,939
look at a state like California which is

327
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,500
massive which is starting to get close

328
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,500
to like half the size of Germany in

329
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,320
terms of population it also has a local

330
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,940
approval requirement in its law and less

331
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,660
than half of those local jurisdictions

332
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,459
have allowed for for cannabis

333
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:58,679
commercialized activities in in their

334
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,799
jurisdictions so that means that Supply

335
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:05,159
in those States is coming like that goes

336
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,599
to people who live in in cities or

337
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,159
counties that do not allow for

338
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,360
commercialized cannabis they're still

339
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,338
able to supply

340
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,360
um the Cannabis that people are going to

341
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,519
consume

342
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,379
so this was one end of the bookend the

343
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,240
the inputs into the system this is the

344
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,480
other end this is the sale so if you

345
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,480
look at our sample Market

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,899
we see that buying patterns are also a

347
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,039
little slower to shift so overnight

348
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,720
consumers are not going to trust that

349
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,679
the commercial market and all the

350
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,200
products that are produced in that

351
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,939
market are fit for their needs and there

352
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,860
just might be supply shortages that

353
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,139
prevent that from happening but we see

354
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,839
that buying patterns also kind of follow

355
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:47,399
a similar trajectory where

356
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:49,500
uh um the the consumers are uh

357
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,778
purchasing more and more over time and

358
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,339
then businesses are ramping up or

359
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:54,720
scaling their operations to be able to

360
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,700
meet that but again it doesn't happen

361
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,278
overnight it takes a little bit of time

362
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,680
for this to happen

363
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,639
so this is a a bit of an eye chart so I

364
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,500
want to take a little bit of time to

365
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,320
explain it so we've looked at

366
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,019
um both all the the inputs uh to the

367
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,519
supply chain and we've looked at what

368
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,578
the total sales so now we can start

369
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,100
taking a look at the breakdown of of

370
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,679
sales or what the breakdown sales look

371
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,420
by product category so for you all in

372
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,299
the upper left-hand corner of the screen

373
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,338
is the market share per product category

374
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:28,939
so we have seven categories that we've

375
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,560
listed here for our sample Marketplace

376
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,180
and what we do here what we did here is

377
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,299
we took the sales

378
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,859
that we had from the previous slide and

379
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:38,879
we broke it down within the category so

380
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,120
you can start to get a little better

381
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,639
understanding of how much of the various

382
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,639
product categories are purchased and

383
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,459
consumed so on our slide here roughly 45

384
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,740
to 50 percent of the market has

385
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,299
consistently been with smokable Bud that

386
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,519
goes directly to the store from

387
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,259
cultivations

388
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,120
followed by concentrates and think of

389
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,220
concentrates as essentially like vaping

390
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,440
products and other types of concentrates

391
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,560
along with infused Edibles that are a

392
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,500
bit of a distant third in comparison to

393
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,239
those two

394
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,399
categories of buds and concentrate and

395
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,100
then on the right hand side because this

396
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,440
is a very important issue is you're able

397
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,680
to actually track what happens to

398
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,420
pricing of products over time so in a

399
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,399
saturated Market where we think that

400
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,099
there's overproduction of cannabis

401
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,679
oftentimes we see prices really starting

402
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,199
to decline rather than the scenario that

403
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,059
we have here where can this bud is

404
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,278
actually kind of like continuing to

405
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,739
climb throughout the first five five

406
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:46,278
years of legalization and we also start

407
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:49,198
to see concentrate Productions start to

408
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,720
decline in this particular scenario

409
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,578
now don't know exactly why that is but

410
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,899
this is giving us some information to

411
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,000
kind of like indicate that there's a

412
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,320
change or a shift in the marketplace I'm

413
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,519
just going to go back here to this slide

414
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,199
real quick

415
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,539
um speaking of the product categories

416
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,939
the the the the graph at the bottom is

417
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,379
just kind of charting out you know how

418
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,899
sales and each one of those product

419
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,759
categories has changed uh from the early

420
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,559
Inception of legalization all the way to

421
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,299
2023.

422
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:20,159
here we just kind of take a closer look

423
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:21,599
at the buds and concentrates and and

424
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,799
what's happened with those over time

425
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,079
because they seem to be kind of like

426
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,819
competing with one another for Market

427
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,819
space in this particular sample Market

428
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,260
that we created for you here and it also

429
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,579
might be on the concentrate side that

430
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,379
those have become much more popular

431
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:36,899
products and so they're producing more

432
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,919
and more of those and as they uh as more

433
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,440
of them are available in the supply

434
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,299
chain than uh um the prices are

435
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,940
decreasing too the bottom line though is

436
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:47,159
that we can always look again kind of

437
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,779
going back to this slide we can always

438
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,559
kind of look at these things to get a

439
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:54,000
closer look at in more detail so while

440
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,219
I'm showing you the aggregate kind of

441
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,259
bigger picture data we can drill down

442
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,740
all the way into or government can drill

443
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:03,480
down all the way into the the

444
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,818
um different categories of products to

445
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,980
get more insights which also is kind of

446
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:10,980
like uh kind of gets us to this next

447
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,078
slide though as I mentioned earlier like

448
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,759
part of the reason we want to have the

449
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:18,240
kind of like centralized collection

450
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:22,379
point for data so that we can inform and

451
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,539
evolve the policy as we see changes in

452
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,579
the marketplace that might be negatively

453
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,379
impacting businesses within the

454
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,539
community within that that regulated

455
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,780
community and one of the more common

456
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,759
things that we hear when when concerning

457
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,759
ourselves about market segments is what

458
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:42,119
is the impact going to be when adult use

459
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:43,798
is implemented on medical programs that

460
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,319
already existed beforehand and what we

461
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,480
see here is kind of like a common uh

462
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,960
pattern that we've that we've seen in a

463
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,538
lot of different states where

464
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,200
the adult use legalization as it's

465
00:17:54,538 --> 00:18:03,200
ramping up we actually see increases in

466
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,120
patient counts and and medical sales as

467
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,980
the regulated adult youth Market is

468
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,459
really kind of starting to take hold and

469
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,279
then as the adult use sales surpass the

470
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,419
medical sales then we start to see those

471
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:19,558
decline back to what they were prior to

472
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,720
legalization and there could be a lot of

473
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,819
reasons for that it could have to do

474
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,860
with

475
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:28,619
pricing and adult use and medical being

476
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:31,259
in parity with one another and so

477
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:32,599
patients migrate back towards the adult

478
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,099
use Market

479
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,678
or like in some of our states we

480
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:39,719
actually see where the medical sales are

481
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,120
saying somewhat steady and that might be

482
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,558
because that the products that are

483
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,659
offered to patients are altogether

484
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,779
different than the products that are

485
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,200
offered to in the adult use market so

486
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:52,940
there are markets still in the U.S where

487
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
the the

488
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,140
medical products are more focused on

489
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,558
high potency low calories versus lower

490
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,320
potency products that are offered in the

491
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,178
uh in the in the Market at any rate if

492
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,460
you look at the the data that's down

493
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,259
towards the bottom of the slide it's a

494
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,480
it's a lot of data but it's still

495
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:14,519
looking at how not only are we looking

496
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,160
at the different segments and gross

497
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:22,379
sales but we're also looking at how

498
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:24,360
those different customers are are and

499
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,480
their buying patterns are shifting over

500
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,699
time so we can we can tell if a patient

501
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,798
purchases are shifting away from

502
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,500
smokable cannabis to concentrates or

503
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,819
edibles or vice versa and then we can

504
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,919
take a much closer look at what's

505
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:40,259
happening in the marketplace to make

506
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,940
informed decisions about that both as a

507
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,200
business but also as Government actors

508
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,298
too

509
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,919
here's a quick close or a closer look at

510
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:49,259
at the cultivation so going back to

511
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,360
cultivation uh one thing that I think is

512
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,740
really important to mention here is or

513
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,038
just like to kind of point out to you is

514
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,599
the the number 226 so when we put our

515
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,058
data together we ended up with actually

516
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,819
a fairly High number any cultivators

517
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,960
here in the in the audience all right so

518
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,460
you know that's a pretty high number of

519
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,500
what you probably celebrate if you had

520
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,419
226 that you packaged out of every plant

521
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,798
so that's a pretty sizable number but

522
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,520
again this is like intended to be

523
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,139
directional and give us a a like an

524
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,779
insights into what the marketplace looks

525
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:24,299
like so this is along the y-axis is 2018

526
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:26,038
to 2023 and across the x-axis is January

527
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:28,679
to March and this is a heat map so the

528
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:31,259
lighter the color the less the yields

529
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,360
were on average during that month

530
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,179
um the darker the color the higher the

531
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,139
yields were and if you look at this like

532
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,820
at a diff like from a different

533
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,440
perspective you'll see that almost every

534
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,918
September and October there's this

535
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,840
massive spike in the the number or the

536
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,580
amount of yield per plant and that

537
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,199
almost always has to do with that being

538
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,178
the time of year where outdoor

539
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,700
cultivations which are included in our

540
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,200
sample jurisdiction are harvested and

541
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,700
they tend to have a little bit higher

542
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,200
numbers so like the the takeaway from

543
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,460
this though is and what's really

544
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,080
interesting and happy to talk more

545
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,480
detail with anybody in the room about

546
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,939
this is laters we did a an analysis on

547
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,558
what this might mean for Social Clubs so

548
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,140
if a social club just say it was like

549
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,899
200 grams was the gold standard per

550
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,720
plant you harvested if you were only

551
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:22,919
able to do that like 65 percent of that

552
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,880
your first year in production uh and you

553
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:29,159
had 500 customers as part of of or 500

554
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,659
members as part of your Social Clubs and

555
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,520
assuming that those three plants that

556
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,620
you're allowed to home grow can be

557
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,359
delegated to the Social Club a social

558
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,879
club a good grower would be able to

559
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:41,099
harvest those three plants four times a

560
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
year and if they were able to do that

561
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,399
and assuming that the numbers that were

562
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,919
used using to kind of inform the

563
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,798
analysis out of our system they'd

564
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,380
actually be as big or bigger than 50

565
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:55,200
percent of the regulated cultivations

566
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,940
that exist in the U.S those are rough

567
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,419
rough directional numbers but Social

568
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,400
Clubs could potentially be significantly

569
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:06,059
sized and so that kind of gets us

570
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,500
thinking about like that that the the

571
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,119
um different schools of thought on how

572
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,099
Social Clubs should be structured going

573
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,719
forward one is is that if they can be

574
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,000
sizable that there probably should be

575
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,100
some form of sensible kind of like a

576
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,140
small scale regulation and transparency

577
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:21,480
of that Marketplace and then the other

578
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,419
side of it that we think about a lot is

579
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,880
is the the reality that those uh that

580
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,520
those social clubs are probably going to

581
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,320
at some point want to transition into

582
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:36,839
the the fully regulated for-profit model

583
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,639
so thinking strategically now uh like

584
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,740
how do we start to collect data on those

585
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,080
that we can better understand how

586
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,240
they're impacted over time when the

587
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:47,099
Market continues to grow with regional

588
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,460
model projects Etc

589
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:52,319
so uh

590
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,840
now I want to kind of transition a

591
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,879
little bit out of that but before I do

592
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,038
um what I want to just like like really

593
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,600
drive home on all the data that we just

594
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,058
looked at in the previous half a dozen

595
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:06,000
or so slides is that that data that

596
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:07,619
we've collected has been proven in every

597
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,298
state that we operate and we operate in

598
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,639
23 different states plus there's other

599
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,980
companies that do similar work to us so

600
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,960
almost every state in the U.S and Canada

601
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,000
they do some form of track and Trace

602
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,759
data and that data has been proven to be

603
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,400
evidentiary in in value and if it's

604
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,500
evidentially and very evidentiary in

605
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,259
value in a Judicial System it can also

606
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,259
certainly be used as evidence to support

607
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:32,519
science and and I think we've like we've

608
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,619
heard a couple of times today that's

609
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,000
very important whatever framework gets

610
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,859
adopted in the EU under current

611
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,200
circumstances for regional model

612
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:42,538
projects has to fit into a scientific

613
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,720
framework and we think that the data

614
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:48,240
that exists right now for describing

615
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,740
what happens in the markets and then

616
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,859
being able to compare it and contrast

617
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:56,159
between the various model projects is is

618
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:58,979
is uh is a is a viable path forward for

619
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,620
creating Regional model projects that

620
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,400
can be done at scale so that the market

621
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:07,379
is is is supports business models like

622
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,940
all of yours and it also supports

623
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,740
investment into those those business

624
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,360
models something that makes it

625
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,620
sustainable going forward

626
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,740
so

627
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,739
um

628
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,400
getting into the thought experiment on

629
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,500
Germany and to kind of elaborate a

630
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,360
little bit more on what I just shared we

631
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,440
took some sample data from our system

632
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,119
and we randomly plant uh plugged it into

633
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,820
Germany kind of like pretending that

634
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,619
Germany's been legalized or we've been

635
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:36,960
tracking cannabis data for for the last

636
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,759
five years and again I mentioned that

637
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,340
it's really important like from up from

638
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,019
a scientific standpoint for uh

639
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:46,439
government officials to be able to

640
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:49,918
describe and compare and contrast we've

641
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:53,220
randomly assigned data from different

642
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,020
areas within the U.S market into states

643
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,519
to kind of just demonstrate for you

644
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:57,779
please don't put a lot of stock on these

645
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,220
numbers it's like we really think that

646
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,058
there's going to be a billion dollars in

647
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,740
sales

648
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:02,658
um in barbaria I think we know barbaria

649
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,159
is probably

650
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:06,840
one of the states that may be slower to

651
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,240
take up Regional products but the the

652
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,720
idea is that you're able to use the data

653
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,819
that's collected within a shared system

654
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,440
where everyone's co-creating value and

655
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:18,240
be able to compare and contrast what's

656
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,038
happening in those regions and then you

657
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
can even take a little bit deeper dive

658
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,579
into

659
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,080
those various regions and get a better

660
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,359
understanding of what might be happening

661
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,639
with those like for example with product

662
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,319
category sales this is just one example

663
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,940
and we could look at test results we

664
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,980
could look at transports we could look

665
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,298
at

666
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,640
plant yields we could look at almost

667
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,259
anything that's in the system and we can

668
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,820
start to be able to compare and contrast

669
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:43,440
what's happening within those

670
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,798
jurisdictions and we think this is a

671
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,120
very important

672
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,859
aspect of creating a scientific

673
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,259
framework and we also think it kind of

674
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,759
fits into that that definition although

675
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,740
it's a little bit different way of

676
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,259
thinking than I think we've seen in

677
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,079
other attempts at adult use legalization

678
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,158
outside the U.S

679
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,699
um

680
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,919
so with that I want to uh

681
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,580
kind of like close with a couple of of

682
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,740
thoughts that we've had as we are

683
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,418
watching closely What's Happening Here

684
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,640
in Europe one is like we're actually

685
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,799
really excited about what the potential

686
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,960
is here and one of the reasons why we're

687
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:23,900
so excited is we've seen this replicated

688
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,240
time and time again where government

689
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,940
collaborates with the industry and other

690
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,500
uh stakeholders that exist within the

691
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,919
ecosystem

692
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,079
to support an industry's effort to

693
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,720
supplant the illicit market and replace

694
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:42,119
it with safer products and we've been

695
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,240
able to like we've been able to see

696
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:47,939
government like balance the the

697
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,620
regulatory requirements not always but

698
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,960
like in some cases be able to balance

699
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:53,339
those regulatory requirements with the

700
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,720
business needs like some of the

701
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:56,519
businesses have been successful and

702
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,740
while we recognize and we're not tone

703
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,139
deaf to the reality that

704
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,240
um the market in the U.S and a North

705
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,220
American General is is definitely

706
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,500
experiencing some hardships along with

707
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,900
some of the other economic downturn that

708
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,240
exists but we do know that if you have

709
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,340
the right data structures in place they

710
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,558
can help to inform that policy when

711
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:17,480
things are a little bit tougher and able

712
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,798
to

713
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,599
right-size the regulation over time no

714
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,700
matter what happens you're not going to

715
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,199
get the the regulations and the laws

716
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,819
correct the first time so you have to

717
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,880
have the right data there to be able to

718
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:33,119
inform how different actors within the

719
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,400
market are being impacted and you can do

720
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,079
that at the same time collaborating and

721
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,360
partnering on what's important to

722
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,918
protect Youth and public health within

723
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,479
within the market

724
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,220
and so

725
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,798
um

726
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,720
we we've seen

727
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:51,119
traceability platforms work successfully

728
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,620
in a lot of different markets and I've

729
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,359
put that into perspective of what's

730
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:55,979
Happening Here

731
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,959
um in Europe and in particular today

732
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,339
it's focusing a little bit more

733
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,019
um on Germany

734
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:07,678
is that research is going to be

735
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:08,940
key for regional model projects and we

736
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,440
think that the research can be

737
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,538
structured in such a ways where you can

738
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,778
have a scalable Regional Model Market

739
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:17,759
Place that's investable and and

740
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,500
sustainable and we think that that while

741
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,839
that's happening that this could also be

742
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,240
done

743
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:26,579
alongside of what is already a viable

744
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,759
Medical Market here in Germany that can

745
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:31,980
coexist alongside of the adult use

746
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,400
Market but to ensure that that's that's

747
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,599
more likely to happen

748
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,580
we think that it's important for the

749
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,199
data to be collected so you can actually

750
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:43,139
kind of showcase and be able to

751
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,720
demonstrate what what uh um different

752
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,400
decisions on the regulatory front of

753
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,798
kind of impact that they're having on

754
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,380
various segments of the market and and

755
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:55,619
in including the medical market and then

756
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,620
the last one uh just the recognizing the

757
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:01,439
fact that

758
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:04,019
every time every time with almost almost

759
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,778
without exception where there's been a

760
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,220
small allowance or a modest allowance

761
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:12,298
for

762
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:15,538
um like an unregulated non-profit uh

763
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:17,700
um a framework for providing cannabis

764
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:21,298
whether it's in a medical or whether

765
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,759
it's an adult use it always always takes

766
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:25,019
on the form of a commercial Market at

767
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,759
some point maybe not right out of the

768
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:28,558
shoot but a couple of years down the

769
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,079
road so it almost always takes on the

770
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,019
appearance of a commercial framework so

771
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:36,359
since we know that to be the case and

772
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,220
and and we know that Social Clubs has

773
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,439
has the potential to be one of the the

774
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,659
key policy lovers that Germany wants to

775
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,460
to pull here then

776
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,380
knowing that those are eventually going

777
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,659
to be taking on a commercial appearance

778
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,940
then now is a really good time to start

779
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,880
thinking strategically about how Social

780
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,399
Clubs can scale and grow to meet some of

781
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,880
the demand which out of the shoot but

782
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,558
also have a viable option at some point

783
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,840
in the future to be able to transition

784
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,658
into what uh we also think is likely to

785
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:09,240
happen which is a more full-scale adult

786
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:12,600
use Marketplace

787
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,980
and I'll close uh right where I started

788
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,319
which is

789
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,298
our experience tells us that

790
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,418
government's successful implementation

791
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:23,579
of cannabis policy is tied very closely

792
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,278
to business success so businesses are

793
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:28,918
not successful in a regulated framework

794
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:31,079
the perception is because it has it's

795
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,240
grounded in reality is that the

796
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,579
government wasn't successful and so that

797
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,038
we have to have both of those empties

798
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,599
among another like another couple

799
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:41,460
different sets of stakeholders that

800
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,459
exist within the ecosystem around

801
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,519
cannabis regulation to be able

802
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,200
uh to work together and collaborate for

803
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,599
the common good the public health and

804
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,640
safety concerns but also

805
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,278
um the the important aspects of creating

806
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,659
a sustainable Market uh where businesses

807
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:00,359
can Thrive

808
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:03,960
um over the Long Haul so I want to thank

809
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:06,298
you again uh for your time today I think

810
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,640
I'm I'm really close to being right on

811
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,898
time for uh for where we were and I want

812
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,120
to thank you again for all being here

813
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:14,519
this morning waking up early I really

814
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:17,699
appreciate you and to the extent that we

815
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,440
can uh elaborate on any of the data that

816
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,960
I showed today I'm happy to meet with

817
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,419
people one-on-one and share some of our

818
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,100
dashboards and some of our data and

819
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:28,320
expand on some of our thoughts we're

820
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,298
also happy to hear push back and

821
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,639
different opinions on how we think this

822
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,679
might go again I'm the Unapologetic

823
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,000
Optimist in the room when it comes to

824
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,620
what we think is possible but it's

825
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,259
grounded in a lot of the experiences

826
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,658
that we've seen

827
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:44,038
watching cannabis regulation unfold in a

828
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,200
couple dozen different jurisdictions so

829
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,859
thanks again for for the time Lewis

830
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,860
