uh and in europe and i do international

57
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:11,680
disputes our cannabis practice has been

58
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,159
kicking off i'd say five to six years

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,800
ago and interestingly it started off

60
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,959
here in germany in dusseldorf frankfurt

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
and munchen

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,319
we do mostly regulatory matters

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,439
corporate matters mna in our cannabis

64
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,759
practice

65
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,079
out of germany but i take care of the

66
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,598
divorce side of things i'm afraid the

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,280
disputes

68
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,479
that's why i'm here to talk to you about

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
today

70
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,878
thank you very much um pete my first

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,719
question to you um

72
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,159
you're you also have experience in the

73
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,919
canadian cannabis market

74
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,799
what's the main difference to the

75
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,799
european cannabis market

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
i would say

77
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,839
the commercial flexibility uh i think we

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,878
know that the canadian market is much

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,840
more mature

80
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,840
um while we see the european market

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
really just starting to develop its legs

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,560
right now trying to figure out um how

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,480
patients are going to be granted access

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,360
in canada there was a wonderful program

85
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,840
with mail order cannabis

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,360
for access versus here you know seeing

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,519
in germany they actually have cannabis

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
going through the pharmacies right so

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
yeah it's just maturity i see it

90
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,479
following a very similar path in terms

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
of how

92
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,399
um cannabis

93
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,000
industry has been maturing from

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
say the north american markets and over

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
here and watching yeah it's almost

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,480
almost like watching it happen

97
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,799
in the future right like we can we can

98
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,079
we can see how it's been evolving and

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
it's like it's already been mapped out

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
for us everything starts with

101
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
cultivation then we start to see lots of

102
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,280
extraction happening then we see more

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
focus on brands and distribution and

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
access

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,519
and

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,680
would you say it's

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,000
or let me ask let me ask something

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,959
different um why didn't you not come to

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,039
germany and grow because germany on

110
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
growers grow cannabis or extract

111
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,039
cannabis why did you come why did you go

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
to denmark because the law in germany

113
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,719
was implemented a lot earlier much

114
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,000
earlier than in denmark was it harder to

115
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,359
apply here or

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,878
well i didn't want to commute compete

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,200
with the demi can guys they had such a

118
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,120
great proposal that was the first one

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,798
but no on the other side of things like

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,319
we took a look at the german market

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,439
great market

122
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,879
but

123
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,959
we were looking for something with a

124
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,918
little bit more commercial access

125
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,879
denmark didn't have any restrictions on

126
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,519
how much we could produce

127
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,879
where we could send it what we could do

128
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,399
so it was really that just that

129
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,560
commercial viability

130
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,000
also on the danger side of things

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
just kind of you know doing business

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,839
internationally we took a look at the

133
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
government infrastructure and how much

134
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,198
support was at that government level and

135
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
how stable

136
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,879
that program was and that was another

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,600
big indicator because we were looking at

138
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,439
portugal or greece or or germany and it

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,639
just it just made sense in denmark it

140
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,680
was like an eight out of nine vote um to

141
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,840
be passed through by law so if the

142
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,800
political regime was to change there was

143
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,038
still majority favor for that um

144
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
so it just it just made sense for us for

145
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,478
our investment

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,520
rudolfi thanks a lot um

147
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,399
as i you know in europe we have

148
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,478
a very lot different regulations on

149
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,638
medical cannabis europe based in

150
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,159
australia australia is also important to

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,280
the german market

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,039
as a lawyer what would your as a as an

153
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,439
investment expert what would you

154
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,079
recommend somebody who wants to make

155
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,000
canada business in europe how where

156
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,399

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,319
countries who announced that they will

158
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,120
have a medical cannabis program i

159
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,038
remember like greece for example

160
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,399

161
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,918

some work in australia what would you

163
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,439
recommend a strategy to enter the

164
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,038
european market okay thanks michael

165
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,279

pete has just told you guys a couple of

167
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,638
seconds ago

168
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,800
i would first and foremost recommend a

169
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,478
stable country

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,478
politically stable

171
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,599
cannabis stable

172
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,519
uh cannabis and it's not unlike other

173
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,800
industries frankly i mean i do a lot of

174
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,198
mining and and oil as well so

175
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,879
big dirty stinky stuff that is quite

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,800
controversial right

177
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,959
um and the attitude toward those

178
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,960
industries is fluctuating

179
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,839
cannabis is the same you've seen

180
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,159
countries that have announced in europe

181
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,119
take greece that yeah it's going to be

182
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,439
kind of this party we're going to

183
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,959
liberalize and create a real market

184
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,959
government changes because there are

185
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,279
elections like in any democratic country

186
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,359
and in non-democratic countries boom new

187
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,279
government now you know what canada is

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
not so sure

189
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,439
you don't want to end up in a country

190
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,279
where that's the case especially if it's

191
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,879
not a very cheap country you know i mean

192
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,038
there are plenty of countries in other

193
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,519
continents and i'm thinking latin

194
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,839
america sub-saharan africa um and

195
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,758
southeast asia where you know high risk

196
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,598
but high reward it's so cheap to grow

197
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,520
stuff there that it might make sense to

198
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,598
take the risk but europe is not cheap

199
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,318
right um so you want to make sure that

200
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,000
the first thing you do is to set up shop

201
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,080
in a country where you know your

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,240
operations are legal

203
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,519
and second where you expect they will

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,199
remain legal in the years to come so i i

205
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,639
totally get what you've just said pete

206
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,199
and i can only encourage you to do the

207
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,918
same uh of course germany i think is

208
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,439
rock solid frankly uh there's little to

209
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,719
doubt from germany

210
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,519
i'm

211
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,599
spain has been very vocal

212
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,918
i've got some reservations again based

213
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,399
on how they behaved with all their

214
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,240
industries think renewables at the turn

215
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,000
of the 2000s you know they were like oh

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,519
yeah we're going to go green so all

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,279
those companies you just come make

218
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,519
electricity here with those nice wind

219
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,959
farms and solar panels it's gonna be

220
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,399
expensive but don't worry we will

221
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,239
subsidize you

222
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,560
what do you know six to seven years

223
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
later government changes like oh you

224
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
know what it costs me a lot of money

225
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
this so just forget about the incentives

226
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,759
yeah but i've invested like hundreds of

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,439
millions in that country already and you

228
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
told me it's based on incentives in my

229
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,839
business model of revolvers and

230
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,598
instances yeah sorry man i can't do

231
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,239
anything for you anymore so that's what

232
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,639
you want to avoid right when you start

233
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
uh setting up shop abroad generally

234
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,000
speaking and that's my thoughts on

235
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,399
europe particularly

236
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
thank you rudolfi and let me just ask

237
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,560
you

238
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,759
in addition

239
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,879
because

240
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,360
in germany we just got the first

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,919
deliveries from south africa and from

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,000
lesotho and when

243
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,399
when you normally hear that you also

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,639
think or when they announced it i

245
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,320
thought okay this is one of the country

246
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,240
that announced to a grow medical

247
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,159
cannabis which will never come to german

248
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,759
pharmacies and i was quite surprised how

249
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,159
come that that that there's a difference

250
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,360
in results in south africa

251
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,039
um

252
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,800
i think

253
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,879
you know and again

254
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,719
i'm gonna say the same thing

255
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,639
this is new cannabis it's a new industry

256
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
now we're at that euphoria stage where

257
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,919
everybody wants to do it because

258
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,320
everybody sees you know there are

259
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,479
billions in in the industry just waiting

260
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,560
up to be made right

261
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
and of course african countries are no

262
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,719
exception uh they have seen the

263
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,039
opportunity just like what they have

264
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,360
before with mining and oil they don't

265
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,120
really have the know-hows and financial

266
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
capabilities so right now they're

267
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
attracting a lot of foreigners and want

268
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,479
to attract a lot of farmers to help them

269
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,160
develop their market and obviously they

270
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,399
know they're not so much a consumer

271
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,719
market but rather an export market for

272
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,120
consuming markets consuming markets have

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,040
we've heard earlier from jada it's here

274
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,799
in europe and it's in the u.s so that's

275
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,799
that's why now you've seen those

276
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,399
shipments coming up and there are

277
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:47,439
companies from canada from um england

278
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,360
and even australia now heavily investing

279
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,279
in south africa lesotho and even

280
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,879
zimbabwe

281
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,399
because they have seen that there is an

282
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,278
opportunity to grow

283
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,159
very good quality hemp and cannabis for

284
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,278
cheap

285
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:03,838
and then process it maybe in europe or

286
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:07,919
processing back home in australia and

287
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:11,519
then export it to consuming markets yeah

288
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:15,199
thank you rudolfi um my next question

289
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,679
goes out to pete as a canadian

290
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,640
or a canadian based

291
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,919
salesmen and you also know the us market

292
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,480
probably

293
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,719
and everybody is waiting for federal

294
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
legalization and

295
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,440
yeah

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560
and

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,200
because then first u.s companies could

298
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,838
export to europe as well

299
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,839
and that would be a game changer i think

300
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
how do you expect the chances for this

301
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,440
scenario

302
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,919
oh man that's a good one um

303
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,680
so with federal legalization it's in

304
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,159
discussion right now i think the safe

305
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,039
banking act is going to be a good bridge

306
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,600
uh

307
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,078
towards that discussion even further um

308
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,278
i do think uh with the democratic party

309
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,879
that they're gonna

310
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,720
they're gonna use it as a platform for

311
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,838
the next election

312
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,879
that's what i would do if i was in

313
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,480
politics

314
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,240
they don't really have any promises in

315
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
their current foundation to say look

316
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,278
we're gonna legalize it during this

317
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,440
four-year period

318
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,120
so why not use that as another

319
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
indication to say let's bring in some

320
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,519
votes

321
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,639
it won't be biden because i think he's

322
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,159
going to be too old for the next

323
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,399
presidency but

324
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,519
whoever is the next democratic

325
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,919
leader

326
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,839
using that as a platform to yeah drive

327
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,759
additional votes

328
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,560
so it's a possibility

329
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,799
so

330
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,479
a little patience it's a little patience

331
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,838
i think it will be a game changer it's

332
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
going to drive a lot of investment

333
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
capital into the business

334
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,920
a lot like a lot of institutional

335
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,399
funding will continue to come in um and

336
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,240
since it's federally legal um and you

337
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,839
know you can expense stuff properly i

338
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,879
think that'll be a pretty big game

339
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,079
changer

340
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,000
and then we're going to start to see

341
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,239
yeah even more capital flood into europe

342
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,799
like we did when it happened in canada

343
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,399
right so uh it just depends on what they

344
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,000
decide to do with that wave of capital

345
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,360
and what types of business decisions are

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,639
made in this

347
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,919
international

348
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,360
expansion

349
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,639
thank you

350
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,959
rodolfi

351
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
safe banking is a good keyword he just

352
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,799
mentioned um

353
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,200
what obstacles

354
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,078
can cannabis

355
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,959
investors face when it comes to safe

356
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,159
banking which is a very very big issue i

357
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,239
think

358
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,319
right so um

359
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
the problem with banking is that and i

360
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,800
think you know the u.s is a very good

361
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,320
textbook example of that

362
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,838
um even when you set up domestic

363
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
operations

364
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
um banks are super hostile to lending

365
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,159
you money

366
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,800
even if your business is just going to

367
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,319
be in colorado

368
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,799
you say look i just want to set you up

369
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,480
in colorado in colorado i have potential

370
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,559
customers in colorado

371
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,039
business partners in colorado you go to

372
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,278
banking colorado and they're like um

373
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,240
yeah we're going to think about it and

374
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,720
the reason for that is it's not legal at

375
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,639
the federal level you can only imagine

376
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,959
what a bank is going to tell you if you

377
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,560
go to that bank and say hey

378
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,958
i'm going to explain internationally you

379
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,958
know what i'm going to sell my stuff in

380
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,599
say europe in germany it's like whoa

381
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,759
whoa whoa i mean if you told me i'm

382
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,920
going to sell it you know in boulder i'd

383
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,360
be like maybe

384
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,719
dusseldorf

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,600
not so sure

386
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,360
um so that's one of the big issues that

387
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,959
i think companies have to cannabis

388
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,000
companies have to solve right now is the

389
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,078
funding

390
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,639
but there are perspectives of hope

391
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:38,078
because you can see in europe

392
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,799
that um even the eu now is pushing hard

393
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,278
toward legalizing at least cbd

394
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,198
and from the moment you have a

395
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,519
harmonized regulation that covers an

396
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,519
entire region then banks will feel a bit

397
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,240
more comfortable to do that

398
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,000
certainly clifford chance i

399
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,399
historically i gotta say we're not

400
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,958
disputes oriented we're more regulation

401
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,240
oriented and transaction oriented

402
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:04,479
for the past two years we've had at

403
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,198
least four or five big banks operating

404
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,079
internationally coming to us and asking

405
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,879
all right i think i'm getting ready to

406
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,879
you know start opening the

407
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,120
green gates not not you know cannabis

408
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,480
but the dollars

409
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
i want to know

410
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,680
if i can do that and i want to know on a

411
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,720
country per country basis

412
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,198
how exactly i can lend money to cannabis

413
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,278
businesses what kind of businesses and

414
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,078
what conditions and then next step would

415
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,240
be

416
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,399
if i lend money to fund you know

417
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,278
cannabis operations in germany

418
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,360
then can i lend some more money to fund

419
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,000
that business internationally

420
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,278
and and that's how we see at our own

421
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,278
level

422
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,759
that there is a shift that is occurring

423
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,600
right now and that's thanks to you know

424
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,360
that those politics that are taken at a

425
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,120
broader eu level as opposed to country

426
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
per country level it still makes it

427
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
challenging like being a business

428
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,078
in this environment and dealing with

429
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,920
banks like it's one of the things if

430
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,159
you're looking to expand into germany or

431
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,078
open up in denmark or whatever it may be

432
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,759
um how many north americans do we have

433
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,239
in the room today

434
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,399
okay so a few like i so as a canadian

435
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,519
like i had a canadian business sold

436
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,120
but while we were operating that

437
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,039
canadian business

438
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,720
it i was kicked out of cibc uh rbc

439
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,519
uh

440
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,199
like and this is legalized federally and

441
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
we were still kicked out of the banks uh

442
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,599
it was incredible even here in denmark

443
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,720
or here in denmark we're in germany

444
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,839
uh in denmark uh donsko bank uh didn't

445
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,720
want to work with us so we had to go to

446
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,440
one of the smaller banks uh jessica or

447
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,800
i think that's what it's called

448
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,320
the danish friends in here are nodding

449
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,838
at me so i got it uh so yeah banking is

450
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,199
banking is a challenging one um even

451
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
though they might be given the thumbs up

452
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,120
they have to do the internal checks and

453
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
know your customers and not even just

454
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,039
that just do they want to deal with

455
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,320
cannabis so making sure that you've got

456
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,078
backups

457
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,879
backup banks just in case you get kicked

458
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,039
out

459
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,838
all of a sudden you have nowhere to put

460
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,958
your cash to pay your bills and

461
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,480
collect your customer invoices

462
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,078
um

463
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,879
do you think

464
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,879
that may cause further problems in the

465
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,919
future because uh

466
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,278
cannabis money is already there a lot

467
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,360
and

468
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,679
if you cannot invest with it or deal

469
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,199
legally with it what are the dangers for

470
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,679
the future if that

471
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,838
is not solved within if within a certain

472
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,758
range of time

473
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,399
all right let me say this then and i

474
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,399
think it expands again on what pit has

475
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,679
mentioned and what we have touched upon

476
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,278
a bit earlier in our discussion

477
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,278
it's one thing

478
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,879
to have a business plan

479
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,559
you know contemplating in what

480
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,039
jurisdiction you're going to set up shop

481
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,198
and expand your operations you know

482
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,159
and then take greece you have plans for

483
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,599
greece and then three months later oh

484
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,439
man change of government they don't want

485
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,159
to do cannabis anymore

486
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,720
you know i need to find a new place to

487
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,480
expand my operations but hey at the end

488
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,679
of the day it's fine i've not invested

489
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,160
any money yet it was just a plan

490
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,160
problems arises when

491
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,240
you have already poured your money into

492
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,880
a place

493
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,038
you have applied for a license or even

494
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,280
you have a license or a permit to grow

495
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,798
the stuff or to manufacture it or to

496
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,279
export it

497
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,720
and few months a few years down the line

498
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,000
suddenly then there is a change of

499
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,038
government

500
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,359
um

501
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:36,079
and suddenly oh wait uh my license been

502
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,359
taken away or i had applied to renew my

503
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,960
license and now the government won't

504
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,038
give it to me problem is it's all

505
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,120
license based right so if you don't have

506
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,960
a license you don't have a business and

507
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,719
you don't have money anymore

508
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,120
um

509
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,440
i'm not here to give investment advice

510
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,159
in that or what are the alternatives for

511
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,759
you as a business to invest in

512
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,279
i'm here to tell you there is a way to

513
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,400
get that money back

514
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,839
or to prevent it from going away and

515
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
it's quite simple

516
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,759
it's just that you don't know about it

517
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,599
but i do because it's my job

518
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,000
there is a network

519
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,599
of international investment treaties

520
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,440
they've been developed after world war

521
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,119
ii because everybody wanted to do for an

522
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
investment to rebuild europe rebuild the

523
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,558
world so boom 3000 treaties in the span

524
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,119
of 50 years being concluded by countries

525
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,678
on a one-on-one basis on a multilateral

526
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,159
basis but like in the eu right

527
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,600
those treaties are free by definition

528
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,320
there are treaties

529
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,480
but they don't only concern states and

530
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,480
like most treaties they concern you as

531
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,519
businesses why because those treaties

532
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,000
give rights to businesses and those

533
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,558
rights are fairly straightforward my

534
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,279
right is not to be expropriated you know

535
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,480
my company taken away by the government

536
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,960
my license taken away my ip taken away i

537
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,720
have a right to be treated fairly you

538
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,720
know my investment not only cannot be

539
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,079
expropriated but can you just play cat

540
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,679
and mouse with them you cannot tell me

541
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,639
one day here's a license the next day oh

542
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,640
yeah i don't know if i'm going to give

543
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,280
it to you right

544
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,559
and lastly but most importantly you have

545
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:11,200
access to an alternate judicial system

546
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,399
and if i may just expanding on that

547
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,279
thought

548
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
say

549
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,519
you invest and you know i want to take

550
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,440
example of spain it's a bit unfair if

551
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,279
we've got spanish friends here today but

552
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,600
again it's based on recent very recent

553
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,839
history you invest in spain because they

554
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,678
live liberalize the cannabis market they

555
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,759
even give you incentives to grow stuff

556
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,120
there because you know space is nice

557
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,960
nice sun fertile soil there we go

558
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,798
you do that for five years or invest

559
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,919
dozens of millions or a bit less or a

560
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,400
bit more you know depending on the

561
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,080
skills of the operation and then one day

562
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,759
spain's wake up and realize oh you

563
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,599
know those incentives they cost me a lot

564
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,440
of money and at the end of the day i

565
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,000
don't make that much money out of it so

566
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,440
maybe it's time to let them go right all

567
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,440
of a sudden your business model

568
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,519
collapses because it was based on those

569
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,919
incentives

570
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,960
now you could go to spain courts and you

571
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,799
know the spain judicial system comparing

572
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
it to the french one say is roughly

573
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,798
similar it's fine we have independent

574
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,959
judges

575
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,200
but it's very slow

576
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,919
and on top of that

577
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,240
cannabis is political

578
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,919
i can see in my own country you know

579
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,000
home country france

580
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
that not everyone is very happy about

581
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,159
the perspective of even just legalizing

582
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,200
cbd right

583
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,960
you've got people and and not just a few

584
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,558
like half the people really in france

585
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
like i don't like cannabis i don't want

586
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,918
to do any of that and

587
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,839
you go to local courts and of course

588
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,840
you've got local judges you don't pick

589
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,439
your judge right so

590
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,519
you just have to pray that whatever

591
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,919
judge is going to decide your case is

592
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,519
sort of okay with cannabis

593
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,600
alternatively

594
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,519
with that attended judicial system it's

595
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,599
called arbitration

596
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,480
it is designed for businesses to pick

597
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,480
their own judges internationally

598
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,000
and that's the you know one of the most

599
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,919
important protections you can get under

600
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
those treaties

601
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,440
thank you

602
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,720
of was good explanation

603
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,919
my next question goes out to pete

604
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,558
despite we have those problems um

605
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,520
cannabis other medical cannabis stocks

606
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,000
are already traded on german stocks they

607
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,960
are detained in luxembourg luxembourg

608
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,759
even changed the medical cannabis law

609
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,600
so they could continue to detain the

610
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,599
stock so we

611
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,558
something moves also

612
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,918
and as it seems recently in my eyes

613
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,639
germany is becoming the trading place

614
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,480
for

615
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,840
european medical cannabis the main

616
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,798
trading place

617
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,279
but the german government does not allow

618
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,279
a lot of companies to grow a lot of

619
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,599
cannabis so

620
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,759
my next question it goes out actually to

621
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:53,199
both panelists what do you think which

622
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,798
will be the or where will be the main or

623
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,279
which countries will be the main

624
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,759
production countries within europe over

625
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,639
the next years because it's not going to

626
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,640
be germany i think

627
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,919
no germany's

628
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,240
going to do a high quality product

629
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,360
probably a very pharmaceutical product

630
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,359
but let's look at portugal spain greece

631
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,479
like when that does get into but any

632
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,319
anybody that's close to the equator

633
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,519
where it's much much cheaper to grow it

634
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,359
just makes sense right um

635
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,400
that's what i see

636
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,479
yeah

637
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,640
um i'm sorry it's not exactly the answer

638
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,679
you expect i guess michael but my answer

639
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
is maybe

640
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,480
europe is just not going to be a place

641
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,599
where you're going to grow the most

642
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,079
stuff

643
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,439
and and again it's part of that evolving

644
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,359
cannabis game

645
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,240
it's not just you may want to seize

646
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,079
opportunities abroad outside europe it's

647
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,079
just you're going to have to probably

648
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,439
because again you know colombia and

649
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,798
latin america south africa even morocco

650
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,440
thailand

651
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,279
those places have the ideal climate to

652
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,038
grow the stuff

653
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,158
it's where is the cheapest in terms of

654
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,480
labor

655
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,480
the only problem again is a matter of

656
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
country risk but we've just addressed

657
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,319
that there are ways to plan ahead of

658
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,880
that but frankly if i if i had to tell

659
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,798
you what country i think will be growing

660
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,919
the most stuff in europe i would say

661
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:15,759
morocco

662
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,640
probably

663
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,599
okay

664
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
thank you

665
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:23,359
and my next question also goes through

666
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,080
you because uh you are australian based

667
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,399
and we never talked about the australian

668
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,798
medical cannabis program here is it

669
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,720
worth to invest in or can you invest in

670
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,480
the australian medical cannabis program

671
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,480
how is that organized there yeah well um

672
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,640
australia has made great strides over

673
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
the six to seven years to liberalize

674
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,679
their medical cannabis market so right

675
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,159
now it's purely medical and industrial

676
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,600
no recreational just yet even though

677
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,039
there are voices already even at the

678
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,480
government level that are trying to

679
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,038
advocate for that

680
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,278
it's it's i'd say a major

681
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:00,240
market in the making

682
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:04,159
um we have a few big companies based in

683
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,720
australia i'm thinking of can global uh

684
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,480
little green pharma that maybe a few of

685
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
you have heard about because they have

686
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,640
they're making great strides in europe

687
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,360
i'd say at the moment what we are seeing

688
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,000
is more like australian cannabis

689
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,278
companies investing outside australia

690
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,759
primarily

691
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,240
in southeast asia so thailand

692
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,319
uh africa and and europe than the

693
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,400
contrary it's possible but i think the

694
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,720
trend is going to be just a bit like you

695
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,559
know like canada and the u.s like big

696
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,480
local companies doing their own stuff

697
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,678
and then trying to export their

698
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,679
operations abroad

699
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,640
pete do you have

700
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
any because you're doing extraction in

701
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,360
denmark

702
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,840
do you uh exclusively separate uh

703
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,319
extract flowers that were grown in

704
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,558
denmark or do you also operate with

705
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,599
flowers that were grown in

706
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,278
out of the european community or is this

707
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,599
a possibility well that's the next fun

708
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,919
part about navigating uh government

709
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,158
regulations so right now in denmark

710
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,960
they're not allowing for bulk import you

711
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,240
can import products into denmark so the

712
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,880
three products that are actually in the

713
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,200
danish medical system for available for

714
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,360
patients bedrocan has three strains of

715
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
their flower and aurora has a gel

716
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,479
capsule that's coming out of canada so

717
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
actually nothing has been produced in

718
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,278
denmark

719
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,839
but right now the regulations don't

720
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,599
allow me to take in flour from say

721
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,079
macedonia bring that into denmark

722
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,879
process and then send it back out

723
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,439
maybe one day it's uh that's where

724
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,360
the some of the the political um

725
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,640
navigation comes into play but in the

726
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,558
same instance there's lots of

727
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,320
cultivation happening in denmark

728
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,158
and some really high quality product

729
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,359
right now which is which is great for us

730
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:52,799
to be able to work with those groups

731
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:56,479
and uh how do you uh what do you think

732
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,119
how long will that take to until

733
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,200
because within the eu it's actually no

734
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,439
problem but how how long will it take

735
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,519
till the market is open to other medical

736
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,400
cannabis markets which is except canada

737
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,240
is still very complicated

738
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,519
how long until the danish market is open

739
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,960
the european market or the european

740
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,519
market

741
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,200
it just yeah it's anybody's guess um we

742
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,038
really i could sit here and try to be a

743
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,759
fortune teller with it but

744
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,200
it's anybody's guess i think what it's

745
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,599
really going to take is just just proof

746
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
proof that you know cannabis coming from

747
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,678
other markets

748
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,360
is meeting that standard of quality

749
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,120
whether it's whether it's a flower or

750
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,599
whether if it's a concentrate and

751
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,759
however it's being formulated from there

752
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,839
it comes back down to quality and that

753
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,679
level of quality and it doesn't meet the

754
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,839
medical systems if you take a look at

755
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
the pharmaceutical industry outside of

756
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,278
cannabis

757
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,720
there's pharmaceutical drugs that have

758
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,798
their raw ingredients that are

759
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
manufactured all over the world and then

760
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,400
those are making their way into europe

761
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,278
to be you know further processed and

762
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,200
then

763
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,880
dropped into germany or denmark or

764
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,558
france or whatever it might be it's the

765
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,520
infrastructure's there the euphorian

766
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,798
substance licenses um allow for that so

767
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,319
it's actually

768
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,679
it's just really just just proving up

769
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,038
quality and then just following the

770
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,038
little pathways that are already

771
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,759
established within the pharma industry

772
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,519
so we're talking about things like gmp

773
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,919
and

774
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,639
my next question to rudolphi because you

775
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,480
just mentioned the

776
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,038
cannabis market in thailand the medical

777
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,440
market i also read a lot about it i did

778
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:32,079
some research that it's uh existing

779
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,240
already it's it's uh this is uh no

780
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:37,038
no fake news or so the medical cannabis

781
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,159
market is already existing in thailand

782
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,839
but i also read is kind of on a private

783
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,840
level or do they know something about

784
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,000
gmp and

785
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,158
like professional production

786
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,640
okay look um i think it's fair to say

787
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,880
that the cannabis market in thailand the

788
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,200
legal one is fairly new

789
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,240
uh in a way that i think still in the

790
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,679
process of developing their regulations

791
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,919
again we only have a few instances

792
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,960
examples of you know companies from

793
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,880
australia say investing in the market um

794
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,720
i don't know to what extent we're really

795
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,720
looking at you know general and all that

796
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,120
stuff at the moment precisely because

797
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,519
it's still in the making interestingly

798
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,759
about thailand it's not it's noob it's

799
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,038
not so new because it started in 2018

800
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,879
when the government started to say okay

801
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,839
okay okay we're gonna liberalize the

802
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,440
market

803
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,918
the following year

804
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,679
the government decided to

805
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,799
take away all the patents for

806
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,519
cannabis-based medicine that were being

807
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,960
developed by u.s and japanese companies

808
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,240
you can imagine the reaction of the

809
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,079
world oh we're going to stop all the

810
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,759
foreign patents on cannabis because you

811
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,278
know you're foreigners and then they're

812
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,960
like no no okay okay it's fine we're

813
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,640
gonna make it real and boom they really

814
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,159
liberalized the market i think it was

815
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,679
early 2020.

816
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,200
um so again opportunities but i think

817
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,278
we're not quite there yet it's not

818
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,558
comparable to the regulations we have in

819
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:01,038
europe at all let alone in in america so

820
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,158
again world of the wise uh interesting

821
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,000
market

822
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,200
full opportunities but just got to be

823
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,558
careful

824
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,278
thank you

825
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,759
my next question to pete is more

826
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,119
european europe-specific

827
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,240
because

828
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:18,719
we know we all know you export you sell

829
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
most of your products to germany

830
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,120
are there any other european countries

831
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,919
you're already exporting to or is there

832
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:28,879
anything you expect that you can that

833
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,640
you have other countries because a few

834
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,559
already have a medical program but they

835
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,600
are not as big as in germany what do you

836
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,519
think is next it's more on the

837
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,319
expectations right so

838
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,000
um

839
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,200
the the various cultivators that we're

840
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,880
working with

841
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,360
and then just helping get their product

842
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
to other countries you know we're seeing

843
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,759
flour from denmark being sent to

844
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,240
australia and new zealand germany

845
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,359
flowers going over to you know poland

846
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,599
now

847
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,000
so yeah this market's available we have

848
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,719
our eyes open for just markets that have

849
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,720
an established rec program or medical

850
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,079
program um an established program where

851
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,000
hey they're either pointing to the

852
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,199
german monograph or they're pointing to

853
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,960
something

854
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,399
that says that we accept this type of

855
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,759
product

856
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,278
in the i don't know the sense of

857
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,519
international business

858
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,200
as a small business trying to

859
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,798
go in at a government level and try to

860
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,278
burn your own path

861
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,679
it's very very expensive right

862
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,359
we always find it's better to find the

863
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,278
local specialists right so trying to

864
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,519
find distributors in poland or czech

865
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,759
republic or

866
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,359
spain or portugal that's really you know

867
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,720
as you talk about expectations that's

868
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,479
where we're at right now as an

869
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,759
organization is finding those

870
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,278
specialists

871
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,278
if there's any out there

872
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,640
hi uh but really yeah finding those

873
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,679
specialists that say look we need

874
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,759
product in spain um

875
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,440
and we're a distributor

876
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,519
that's the type of organization that we

877
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,960
want to work with and it just makes from

878
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,879
an international business perspective it

879
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,720
makes us not have to be experts in every

880
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,559
single market what we can do is just

881
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,919
rely on strategic partnerships and that

882
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,319
makes the business actually run a lot

883
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,320
faster

884
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,278
and

885
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,199
my next question goes to rodolfi what

886
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,640
do you think we didn't talk about south

887
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,558
america yet

888
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,799
when i think back uh in 2013 uruguay was

889
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:18,720
the first country worldwide to legalize

890
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:22,000
cannabis and medical cannabis both

891
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,240
as i know argentina legalized colombia

892
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,278
legalized and the only player that is

893
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,079
mentioned sometimes is colombia

894
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,119
but

895
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,480
not argentina not uruguay and there's

896
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,798
also

897
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,519
more rumors coming from colombia but no

898
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,839
product so far so what's what's in south

899
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,720
america what are the expectations

900
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,319
um

901
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,519
i'm not sure i have an explanation for

902
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,599
that it has to do i guess

903
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,599
in the case of uruguay they were the

904
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,439
first adopters the first mover so that

905
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,558
helps but they still have a very small

906
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,080
economy compared to ventures to colombia

907
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:00,079
and even more so argentina argentina

908
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,960
not too sure but again they have an

909
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:05,359
interesting uh history of treating

910
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,319
foreign investments in a certain way

911
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,319
uh since the early 2000s that might make

912
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,558
more than just a few businesses a bit

913
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,798
reluctant to dive in there you know and

914
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,240
i i certainly understand that

915
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,558
one country you have not mentioned

916
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,798
though michael is mexico

917
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,440
and that's a very interesting case i

918
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,679
think because it was you know all over

919
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,919
the news earlier this year oh my god

920
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,320
mexico is gonna do it

921
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,320
and canada was shaking oh my god they're

922
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,798
going to take over you know the lead in

923
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,798
the americas well we're still waiting to

924
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,720
see it happen i think it's happening now

925
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,240
thanks to the courts

926
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,278
um but

927
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,960
as it

928
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,038
happened elsewhere before that we know

929
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,079
of in europe um but that is certainly

930
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,558
going to be a huge market from the

931
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,639
moment it opens up and certainly it will

932
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,200
opens up to foreign capital

933
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,600
um so i guess my eyes right now are

934
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,600
turned toward mexico because i expect

935
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,000
they're going to end up opening up uh

936
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,000
but but at the moment where it's still

937
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,558
well it's already legal uh probably

938
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
colombia it takes it all

939
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:14,960
for now at least yeah colombia's also uh

940
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,480
i've uh heard a lot seen a little do you

941
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,720
know anything about the colombian

942
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,200
cannabis market

943
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,440
oh sorry it was to you sorry

944
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,278
um so colombia like we just saw the the

945
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,960
news and announcements where colombia is

946
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,319
uh should be allowing or is allowing now

947
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,440
for the export of flowers so that's

948
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,278
going to be game changing for the

949
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,840
organizations that have invested into

950
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,519
colombia again just trying to navigate

951
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,480
those rules and regulations and do some

952
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,679
uh political advocacy um to make changes

953
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,640
right and we're seeing those changes

954
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,840
happening

955
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,960
i was just chatting with a group the

956
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,759
other day they're actually saying that

957
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,278
they're seeing some uh reminiscence or

958
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,200
some policies that are starting to be

959
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,200
put into place to allow for a more of a

960
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,840
localized market and actually i see a

961
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,840
lot of these south american

962
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,319
companies looking to actually just

963
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,000
supply down in south america uh brazil

964
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,398
starting to become a market where it's

965
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
consuming medical cannabis

966
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,439
one of our the investors into our

967
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,280
company is out of brazil toronto and um

968
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,039
they they also have an investment into a

969
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,040
distribution company in brazil and

970
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,480
they're looking for product and it's

971
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,320
it's a growing market it's actually very

972
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,358
cool to see what's happening there

973
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,440
so i think

974
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,039
maybe they might be looking to more i

975
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,800
shouldn't say localized but onto that

976
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,000
just just supplying their continent

977
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,760
right now um as you know many of those

978
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,398
companies have struggled like some of

979
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,079
them have gotten the eu gmp stamp and

980
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,878
certification but many have struggled to

981
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,320
get that level of certification um so

982
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,398
why not

983
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,320
ship to a more localized market where

984
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,199
it's it's less expensive for shipping

985
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,159
and

986
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,358
the market is growing so get a foothold

987
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
so it's cool to see what's happening

988
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,960
down there very interesting thank you

989
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,559
rodolfi my very last question goes out

990
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,720
to you

991
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,440
we heard about a lot of countries now

992
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,879
who are planning to open up for cannabis

993
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,800
investment investments and my very last

994
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,358
question is from the from the

995
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,200
perspective of the consumer of the

996
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,358
patient um

997
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,838
how many of those countries

998
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:14,400
also have a medical

999
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,639
law or a medical program that works for

1000
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,440
the patients already or do they first

1001
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,838
settle up the investments and then make

1002
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,639
the program our open program for the

1003
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:27,039
patients i think there is a tendency in

1004
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,960
running trials before opening up to the

1005
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,039
patients

1006
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,480
it's certainly say you know certainly

1007
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,039
the case in france where right now we're

1008
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,800
conducting trials uh active ones and the

1009
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,000
products being supplied or in part from

1010
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,400
australia

1011
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,320
um so i i and you know when you look at

1012
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,519
thailand it's a bit the same at least

1013
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,640
officially

1014
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,559
the idea when you liberalize the medical

1015
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,039
cannabis industry

1016
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,719
is still to take a

1017
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,239
precautionary approach

1018
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,480
so you don't want to make products

1019
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,919
accessible to all the patients right

1020
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,039
away if you don't know what the products

1021
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,200
are so

1022
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,679
i think in most jurisdictions certainly

1023
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,118
still that are developing their medical

1024
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,078
cannabis market

1025
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,920
the goal first is to have a good product

1026
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,760
um and and that's where you know foreign

1027
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,599
companies come into the picture and and

1028
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,720
they share their know-how uh that they

1029
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,119
have already accumulated in other

1030
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,039
jurisdictions and then in the second

1031
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,680
step when when the government is sort of

1032
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,239
happy with the development of you know

1033
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,159
the product and and has some guarantees

1034
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,159
as pete was saying earlier the need to

1035
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,078
see guarantees then the opening to the

1036
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,039
patients and to the medical profession

1037
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,359
as as a whole but it's still a two-stage

1038
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,279
process in most instances yeah it was

1039
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,639
crystal clear thank you very much

1040
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,440
and i see we're nearly out of time and i

1041
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,799
think we should open or should open the

1042
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,358
questionnaire

1043
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,359
so any questions in the audience

1044
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:50,358
anthony

1045
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,200
i'm trying not to be shy yeah

1046
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,039
um

1047
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,358
hi thank you for this uh for the for the

1048
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,159
panel and for the good conversation um

1049
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,639
i'm a first timer here um so i'm very

1050
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:11,039
happy to be here and join you all i have

1051
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:14,078
a pharmaceuticals background i have been

1052
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,400
working all my life in pharmaceuticals

1053
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,000
and i see these trends as very

1054
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,280
interesting on the one hand i have

1055
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,920
questions because you know

1056
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,280
pharmaceutical large companies tend to

1057
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,680
synthesize

1058
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
natural products eventually i haven't

1059
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,639
heard any word on that in the whole

1060
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,599
meeting and i don't know if that is a

1061
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:34,319
ghost that is out there or not um

1062
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,760
maybe in the future not not so far or

1063
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,160
not so

1064
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,400
recent future i don't know um but that's

1065
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,159
not my subject my subject is i'm i'm a

1066
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,400
german citizen living here in berlin but

1067
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,598
i represent two colombian companies that

1068
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,160
sell

1069
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,039
cbd and cbg and i'm very happy that we

1070
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,039
heard for the first time in more detail

1071
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,960
about latin america i have good news

1072
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,000
panama has just

1073
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,000
gone through legalizing medical cannabis

1074
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,079
yesterday so they're going to sign off

1075
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,159
the bill next week

1076
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,240
and i think after panama all of central

1077
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,559
america will continue because it's kind

1078
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,239
of a halo effect for the other countries

1079
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,559
as well and you know that panama has a

1080
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,879
very large free trade zone so they are

1081
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,838
very very capable of exporting into the

1082
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,838
rest of the world

1083
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:22,239

mexican so i have a little bit of

1104
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,920
perspective on what's going on there and

1105
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,000
in thailand

1106
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,680
as you mentioned we're working with

1107
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,159
golden triangle group is

1108
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,039
asia's premier leading cannabis company

1109
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,118
they will have eu certification um

1110
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:21,199
flowers available in europe by spring of

1111
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,358
2022 and um medicinal cannabis oils will

1112
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,519
be released uh and sold exclusively by

1113
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,639
the government authority by the thai

1114
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,519
government

1115
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,000
called the gpo and um they will be

1116
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,239
selling their oils in europe in winter

1117
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,800
of this year so thailand uh already is

1118
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,519
starting with the ugmp certification um

1119
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,440
mexico the biggest problem in uh delays

1120
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,519
there are with the politicians it's an

1121
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,838
act an inept government they've been

1122
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,519
totally unable to uh to fight against

1123
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:48,880
the cartels so they just let the cartels

1124
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,599
do whatever they want and in the same

1125
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,400
vein they're unable to push forward with

1126
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,280
legislation the courts um

1127
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,280
are on the side of the legislation of

1128
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,359
cannabis but the politicians are still

1129
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,200
not able to pull themselves together and

1130
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,799
uh push anything forward there's a

1131
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:09,118
massive expectation in uh

1132
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,640
local national capitalists that are

1133
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,640
waiting to invest in mexico but they're

1134
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,400
all uh waiting for a little bit more

1135
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,639
clarity um

1136
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,119
so it's kind of stuck there's really no

1137
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,719
vision there's no way to push forward at

1138
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,160
present and it's still

1139
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,719
completely in in

1140
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,440
in the cloud so it's a not really much

1141
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,358
clarity for you but um it's gonna happen

1142
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,920
thank you very much uh can we maybe come

1143
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,000
to the next question to the panelists

1144
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,800
because we're here for to ask questions

1145
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,639
thank you

1146
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,640
do you want to take this a statement and

1147
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,318
an update but soon soon we'll get a

1148
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,598
question soon

1149
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:42,960
all right this is probably the last one

1150
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,440
that's the question

1151
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,679
uh what's the current situation uh for

1152
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,400
the cannabis in australia

1153
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,719
for rudolf

1154
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,880
thank you thank you for the question

1155
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,639
um the the current situation for

1156
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,680
cannabis in australia

1157
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:59,679
okay um

1158
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,838
not gonna lie it it's still a developing

1159
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,559
market it's not that big

1160
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,920
um it is making strides on the medical

1161
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,400
side

1162
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,400
we've got i think at least a dozen

1163
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,559
australian stock exchange listed

1164
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,318
companies now

1165
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,960
which is quite impressive because again

1166
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,639
it's fairly recent um and not all states

1167
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,159
have liberalized at the same time the

1168
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,960
federal government

1169
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,519
uh came around the idea just a few years

1170
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,440
ago so it's been growing fast

1171
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,400
just like in other parts of the world

1172
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,400
there's been

1173
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,680
a little bit of a bubble i guess in the

1174
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,559
beginning

1175
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,960
uh and then the stocks have stagnated

1176
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,279
for a little bit but you've got those

1177
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,039
those main like two three main cannabis

1178
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,040
companies i'm really thinking of little

1179
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,639
green pharma

1180
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,039
can global

1181
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,920
and a couple others that now really have

1182
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:59,679
established proper operations it's still

1183
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,039
not a massive consumer market uh it's

1184
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,358
getting there because of the you know

1185
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:06,079
the aussie way of life and we're all

1186
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,719
surfing and wellness and all that thing

1187
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,039
so uh there is potential but i am not

1188
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,358
too sure whether it is a target

1189
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,480
destination right now for foreign

1190
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,639
um

1191
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,119
cannabis companies certainly because

1192
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,519
again i think what's happening is they

1193
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,119
are growing their own companies locally

1194
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:26,400
and those companies already have started

1195
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,200
to invest abroad because again of the

1196
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,000
growing cost and manufacturing costs so

1197
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,639
i see it more as an outward cannabis

1198
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
destination than inbound or in world one

1199
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:37,358
that's pretty much the state of the

1200
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,838
affairs

1201
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,880
you've got more and more people at the

1202
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,199
politician level that are pushing for

1203
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,280
recreational cannabis to be legalized

1204
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,598
and that's in the wake of you know

1205
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,480
canada and the u.s that are still

1206
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,359
revered in in australia due to their

1207
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,719
relationship in the commonwealth etc so

1208
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,719
i think we're getting there and

1209
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:01,039
certainly you know

1210
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:05,118
aussies do smoke pot and not just

1211
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:07,759
because of headaches or cancer um so

1212
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,160
there is potential but it's not as fast

1213
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,079
moving on that specific front as it

1214
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:16,239
could be in other jurisdictions i guess

1215
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,240
to be perfectly uh fair and transparent

1216
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,000
the shops specialty shops

1217
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,919
yeah i'm not too sure we're going to see

1218
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,920
them anytime soon and you know you need

1219
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,400
to be aware they have a funny

1220
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,760
relationship to vice stuff in australia

1221
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,119
because like potty is okay somehow but

1222
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,000
cigarettes are like 25 bucks a pack so

1223
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,000
you know

1224
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,519
it's not the clear-cut market and no i'm

1225
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,480
not so sure we're gonna see specialty

1226
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,039
shops

1227
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,280
very soon uh i have hopes but just not

1228
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,800
