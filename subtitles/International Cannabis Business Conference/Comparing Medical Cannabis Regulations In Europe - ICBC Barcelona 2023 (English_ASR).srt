109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,780
regulations started to be released and

110
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,339
the need for traceability was apparent

111
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:57,119
so I've been working there for the past

112
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:59,599

um

122
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:22,258
we've been working in the

123
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,079
cannabis industry for almost 15 years we

124

00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:34,739
economics Club so anything we can help

127
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:36,779
here we are let's start first of all

128
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,918
I think we're going to start from

129
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,899
Alex

130
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:44,399
briefly please how's the medical Medical

131
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:47,099
Market going medical cannabis Market

132
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,620
going in in Canada well I'll try to do

133
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,400
it as briefly as possible and say pretty

134
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,560
good we've come a long way but since the

135
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,239
regulations kind of came out we've kind

136
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,680
of worked within them and slowly

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,660
stretched them out to a decent

138
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,639
regulation and you know the sort of

139
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,259
sensor I would describe it as we're

140
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000
probably better than pretty much

141
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,199
everywhere else but still have a lot of

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,779
way to go

143
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,460
okay great I know Carlos how is

144
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,918
everything going in Pokemon

145
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:16,500
um yeah I mean we uh we have the the

146
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:20,519
regulation I mean the new regulations

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,500
were were released in uh 2018.

148
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,939
um I mean it's illegal to to grow

149
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,699
medical cannabis since 1993 but with the

150
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,560
Big Industry with in fact from the the

151
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,120
international companies especially from

152
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Canada that they would like to come to

153
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,879
to Europe our authorities started

154
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,300
looking for how they can help those

155
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:45,719
companies to build and license their

156
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,360
their activities there in in Portugal so

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,060
the neural regulation was released in

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,879
2018 which helps a lot in terms of how

159
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,699
we can do it it was more clear we know

160
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,139
exactly what what is the path that we

161
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,978
can take

162
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,019
um so I believe that in terms of

163
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:06,899
getting the license or build your own

164
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:10,379
projects it's it's more solid at the

165
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,899
moment what is uh it's not too clear for

166
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,240
us in Portugal is the products that they

167
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,579
have available on the pharmacy I believe

168
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,199
that that is one of the the main issues

169
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,719
that you have at the moment in Portugal

170
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,400
okay we will talk about products after

171
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,599
great

172
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,758
um Daniel

173
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,579
um framework opened up in Switzerland

174
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,500
last year how is everything going

175
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,060
a good question I am also going to try

176
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,519
to be brief but essentially the

177
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,199
framework before

178
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,120
it opened up last year was that you

179
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,080
needed a special permit from the federal

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,000
Office of Public Health to be able to

181
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,098
procure and get cannabis prescribed by a

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,680
doctor in Switzerland was quite uh

183
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:54,240
complicated from an administrative

184
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,400
perspective process so this changed last

185
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,340
year still complicated but what changed

186
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,279
is that cannabis was reclassified from a

187
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:05,279
prohibited narcotic to a class to a

188
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:07,318
controlled substance and now every

189
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,598
doctor in Switzerland can freely

190
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,319
prescribe medical cannabis which was a

191
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:16,199
huge step forward for for the medical

192
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,020
Market the problem is that doctors are

193
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,240
faced with a lot of challenges one of

194
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,799
the challenges for example is that they

195
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,478
don't know the biggest challenge they

196
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,759
don't know much about medical cannabis

197
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,579
don't know how to prescribe it there's a

198
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,899
lot of administrative burdens that their

199
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,819
with so it's going well and there is an

200
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,278
interest

201
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,778
however there hasn't been Mass adoption

202
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:44,399
by doctors yet but there is full and

203
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:47,278
full therapeutic freedom

204
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,120
for doctors to prescribe for whatever

205
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:53,519
ailment they they wish

206
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,700
but there is a lot of Education that

207
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,278
needs to happen and so I would say we're

208
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,379
a very big step forward but we're far

209
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,179
away from where we want to be you just

210
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:04,980
start at least you're starting

211
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,439
Switzerland or like in Spain that we are

212
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,080
still waiting for a politician to take

213
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,120
the first step but may I just ask Google

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
I mean it's uh good for you guys the

215
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,200
doctor can they can prescribe for the

216
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,620
first time and then they there is any

217
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,560
kind of uh

218
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,299
ranking in terms of medicine they can do

219
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,639
in the past there was a ranking you

220
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:29,039
basically had to be half dead and try

221
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,500
everything else first before you got

222
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,599
medical cannabis and today there's full

223
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,940
therapeutic Freedom which means it's in

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,060
the assessment of the doctor himself to

225
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,320
or herself to prescribe medical cannabis

226
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,719
however

227
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,278
they're also confronted with liability

228
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,019
issues so they still carry full

229
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,820
liability and I think that's one of the

230
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,600
reasons they're actually very reluctant

231
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,800
to prescribe cannabis and also in

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,259
Switzerland

233
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,659
the market really is not on I'm already

234
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,879
talking about the products but you know

235
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,980
in in Switzerland there is no real

236
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,958
market for cannabis flour so it's the

237
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,000
same in Portugal yeah

238
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,119
um so even you know thinking about

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,700
flower and smokeables uh we're far away

240
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,159
from that yeah I mean I was telling that

241
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,860
because in Portugal I mean there are

242
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,259
some some brothers available but it's

243
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,139
it's only I mean it's only possible to

244
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:25,439
prescribe as a last resort it doesn't

245
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,659
make any sense but it is what it is at

246
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,360
the moment and in terms of products you

247
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:32,338
have only two available which is nothing

248
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,839
comparing to what we can get in other

249
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,540
markets

250
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,279
um but again it's uh it's too short for

251
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,579
the the patients that are looking for

252
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:44,220
this kind of product and they and one

253
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,600
another thing that you said and I

254
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,079
completely agree with you we need to

255
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,720
have more more studies or more knowledge

256
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:54,620
for the the medical community so they

257
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,620
can be more confident

258
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:00,299
this is something that we all of us

259
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,379
should push a little bit more to be and

260
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,859
feel

261
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,679
okay can I add one more thing actually I

262
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,000
think it's very important to include

263
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,739
associations for example there's the

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,700
Swiss Society of cannabis in medicine in

265
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,259
Switzerland that he was mandated by the

266
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,420
federal office of public by the health

267
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:21,480
Ministry in Switzerland to basically put

268
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:22,860
together therapeutic guidance or

269
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,800
guidelines

270
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,740
that doctors can take and see for which

271
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,679
indication which medication setup would

272
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,000
make sense in which dosage and so on so

273
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,500
that's something that I would really try

274
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,940
to encourage in countries where it's

275
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,519
only just starting same as in

276
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,860
Switzerland now in its infancy I agree

277
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,100
okay thank you thank you guys and

278
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,440
Santiago can you tell us um which

279
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,079
requirements um

280
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,200
patients needs in in the United States

281
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:55,679
to become a patient yeah so in the U.S

282
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,360
we have more than 30 micro Industries

283
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,338
right it's not legal at the federal

284
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,278
level yet it remains a schedule one

285
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:05,519
substance so every state has its own

286
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,338
regulations the medical industry I would

287
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,778
use a different term I would use

288
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:13,640
therapeutic right because it is very

289
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:15,838
different from your typical medical

290
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,759
industry you don't go to the same doctor

291
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,579
you don't go to the same Pharmacy

292
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,019
et cetera et cetera so the first thing

293
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:24,958
that you need in order to become a

294
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,600
patient is is to be under the correct

295
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,338
ailment so usually when a Market opens

296
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,100
up in the United States it'll be similar

297
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:35,519
right you gotta be half dead in order to

298
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,839
to get a medical license but then as

299
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,940
soon as they become more comfortable

300
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,440
with the market they add something like

301
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,420
chronic pain

302
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,420
to the list of ailments which

303
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:48,838
significantly opens up this therapeutic

304
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:51,240
Market it's almost a way to test the

305
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,519
recreational Market still making people

306
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,100
go to doctors which the doctors

307
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,259
prescribing are usually doctors that

308
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,220
were retired and come out of retirement

309
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,958
in order to charge a hundred dollars per

310
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,540
prescription that they write so it's

311
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,539
it's fairly easy to get a a medical

312
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:12,120
license in uh in the states the

313
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,099
incentive to be a medical patient is

314
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,259
really just where there's no

315
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,200
recreational industry right other than

316
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:21,958
that one both Industries are available

317
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,360
or Alive then really the only incentive

318
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,518
to be a patient is to pay less taxes

319
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,379
but that's a little bit of the U.S

320
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,659
industry good and I would like to know

321
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,278
about Canada because just real real

322
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,139
quick on Canada I wanted to point out

323
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,578
that when we started it was also a last

324
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,100
case Resort you have to show you've

325
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:39,719
tried like everything else but we found

326
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,339
a way around it and one thing I always

327
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,139
try and tell people who are building

328
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,940
International markets is work with the

329
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,620
crappy rules you're given no matter how

330
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,480
crappy they are because we started

331
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,278
really crappy and we've kind of expanded

332
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,139
it to now it can be a first line of

333
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,759
treatment and and two things like pain

334
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,100
which is a little more subjective rather

335
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,838
than measured so I I would really

336
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,759
implore people to kind of work with it

337
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,139
even no matter how bad it is because

338
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,539
we've been there before

339
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,419
let us know Alex also about the which

340
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,699
kind of products patients can get in in

341
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,620
Canada yeah like when it started it was

342
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,940
only dry flour and uh I have a close

343
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,100
friend of mine whose daughter has a rare

344
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,839
form of epilepsy and he was converting

345
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,339
his flour into oil and that was actually

346
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,139
against the law and he could have been

347
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,360
going to jail and had his kid taken away

348
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,159
it's crazy to think about it now that

349
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,200
seems like a lifetime ago but it was

350
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,539
only flower we've come a long way now we

351
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,980
have oils now we have Edibles we have

352
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:30,899
all kinds of extracts I mean we have

353
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,100
limitations on it which we can get into

354
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,458
a little bit later when we talk about

355
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,019
that but uh it's we we have a lot of the

356
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,299
products now and it's come a long way

357
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,980
but there's still a long way to go uh

358
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,778
and yeah I'm interested to hear about

359
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,360
the kind of Portugal and swiss I know

360
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:48,240
Switzerland is really CBD only from what

361
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,339
I'm hearing uh but yeah every every

362
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,440
country is kind of starts very similar

363
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,600
and then just explodes in their own way

364
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,940
so I would love to hear some other yeah

365
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,519
for now for example in Portugal only

366
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,680
have available side effects and and the

367
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,159
flowers from from tilray and and that's

368
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,958
it I mean I know that there are a lot of

369
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,578
companies that are trying to license and

370
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,859
get the special authorization for their

371
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:13,138
products but that kind of process will

372
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,959
take at least one two years to get it

373
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:18,360
done which is a lot of time for any

374
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,879
investor to wait and especially because

375
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,699
I mean Portugal is a small country so

376
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,338
perhaps there is no no kind of advantage

377
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:30,120
of looking for our Market to license and

378
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:32,100
take so much time to to to do it but at

379
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,679
the same time it could be something that

380
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,920
then then you can expand for the rest of

381
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,419
the European countries

382
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:42,000
yeah I mean you can start in Portugal

383
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:43,799
and then you can try to adapt the same

384
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,559
the same authorization for the other

385
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,659
countries but anyway it will take you a

386
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,018
lot of time and I believe that that's

387
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:55,139
why it's it is taking so much to to get

388
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,019
new products in the in our Market

389
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,720
yeah so Switzerland is not just a CBD

390
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,060
Market but it's really well known for

391
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,240
being you know for the consumer markets

392
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,259
a big CBD Hub CBD producer of oils and

393
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,720
so on

394
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,778
um however on the medical sphere there's

395
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,959
also CBD that is actually prescribed by

396
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,939
form of magisterial preparation in

397
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,500
certain there's not many pharmacies that

398
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,339
do it but the few

399
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,399
CBD and obviously THC now as well and

400
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,779
we're talking mostly full spectrum in

401
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,759
Switzerland there's only two fully

402
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,820
licensed drugs which is epidiolex and

403
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,139
side effects in most cases they're used

404
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,278
off-label

405
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:40,019
however these so these and and also not

406
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:41,639
necessarily and always reimbursed by the

407
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,919
health insurance it's another subject

408
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,560
that we can touch upon but basically

409
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:50,458
most cannabis in Switzerland is

410
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,859
prescribed now with THC I would say and

411
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:56,399
by way of magisterial preparation which

412
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,680
the pharmacies have to be involved

413
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,139
his name is German and the U.S is all

414
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,939
over the place the U.S is great yeah I

415
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,679
mean if we're talking medical products

416
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,779
that have gone through clinical trials

417
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,660
and have FDA approved then we're talking

418
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:12,058
that sativax and epidiolex I personally

419
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,040
have never seen those products and if I

420
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,980
never see them in my life I would be

421
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:20,220
totally fine the medical industry which

422
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,140
again I would name therapeutic has any

423
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,699
type of product under the sun right a

424
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,079
lot of the Innovation comes from there

425
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,480
so you have

426
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,819
um also being micro Industries you have

427
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,259
states that allow everything then you

428
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,839
have other states that because of the

429
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:36,960
medical argument they wouldn't allow

430
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:40,199
flour and then the next step is to allow

431
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,298
flour but not smokeable only vaporized

432
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,640
so those States might not allow pre-roll

433
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:46,918
sales for example they will sell you

434
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,660
flower but technically you cannot roll

435
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,820
it and smoke it you need to vaporize it

436
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm just curious because you said before

437
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:58,019
that cannabis doctors basically are

438
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,058
specialized doctors in cannabis would

439
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,200
they also prescribe other medication if

440
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,519
you have a

441
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,140
you know I'm just thinking about

442
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,019
neuropathic pain patient for example

443
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,880
that has a mix of maybe three four

444
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,220
various medications that the person

445
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,080
needs to take I would say specialized is

446
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,880
a loose term these are just doctors that

447
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,220
are coming out of retirement so they can

448
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,440
make a few hundred dollars a day so

449
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,298
they're as specialized as they need to

450
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,220
be in order and they will only prescribe

451
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:26,759
cannabis then they don't prescribe

452
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,460
cannabis they allow you to get a license

453
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,200
that allows you to enter a medical yeah

454
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,640
we say they authorize the use of

455
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,380
cannabis because cannabis doesn't have a

456
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,080
drug identification number so can't be

457
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,880
prescribed so we say it's they authorize

458
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,500
your the use and quickly just to point

459
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,820
out why are all the retired doctors

460
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,440
doing it because I was also wondering

461
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,298
why are all these old doctors doing it

462
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,860
the reason is they're not scared of

463
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:48,418
losing their license they don't they

464
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,798
don't care so it's these young guys

465
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,059
they're like oh I don't want the stigma

466
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,859
and I don't want people to know me as a

467
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:55,200
cannabis doctor these old guys are like

468
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:57,359
whatever will just cover my beers at the

469
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,919
golf course and they just they just go

470
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,579
and do it but hey that's how the

471
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,580
industry started

472
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,960
[Music]

473
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,280
in the US it's still a scheduled one

474
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,620
substance so it's still federally

475
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,879
illegal yeah yeah okay we've had a lot

476
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,500
just to point out we had a lot of

477
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,960
threats of doctors losing their license

478
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,279
but I could tell you in Canada no one

479
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,600
ended up losing their license no matter

480
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,058
how much investigations and everything

481
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,339
everyone's so scared it never happens so

482
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:29,639
you know it's more just threats

483
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:31,918
and another important issue guys what

484
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,919
about the insurance or Social Security

485
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,780
does the insurance cover the medical

486
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,700
cannabis

487
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:41,220
altar because I kind of made a career

488
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,500
out of this insurance uh thing I helped

489
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,058
a lot of military veterans uh help with

490
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,160
cannabis and I'm very proud of it and it

491
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,480
helped with a lot of conditions of PTSD

492
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,100
and removed a lot of their other

493
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,558
medications I mean that's a whole long

494
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,819
story but uh it made a lot of money for

495
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,500
the company I was a part of and then

496
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,359
people right away were like oh you're

497
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,859
just doing it for the money and some of

498
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,779
us were only doing it for the money to

499
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,279
be honest but I actually always really

500
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,619
cared about the veterans I knew them all

501
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,058
by name and I know how much it helped

502
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,500
them and and it changed their life so

503
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,418
military veterans are getting coverage

504
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,419
now we're starting to see some police

505
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,038
people get coverage

506
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,419
private insurance is covering the up to

507
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,339
two thousand dollars with Health Care

508
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,259
spending accounts which you can use for

509
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,119
like massages and other things so we're

510
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,379
starting to see a big move in that and

511
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,178
that's going to be a big game changer

512
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,799
when we talk about medical versus wreck

513
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,480
a little later I'll kind of explain a

514
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,639
little more but I mean we're all waiting

515
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,038
for the insurance train to come along uh

516
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,038
it's almost arrived but it's gonna come

517
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,859
like for example Germany Germany has

518
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,319
pharmacare already so insurance is going

519
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:41,579
to be a real big push of medical

520
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,259
cannabis Market internationally

521
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:46,259
eventually with more research of course

522
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,259
well

523
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,298
um as a matter of fact I mean we don't

524
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:54,480
have any or too much experience in the

525
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:56,099
with the product itself so I don't know

526
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,660
any kind of insurance company for

527
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,079
example that a private insurance company

528
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:04,340
that can uh help the the patients in

529
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:09,119
this matter I know that our health

530
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:13,038
authority can co-found this kind of of

531
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:16,739
products but until now there is no

532
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,419
no support in this internal products

533
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,940
unfortunately

534
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,440
now just before I come to Switzerland I

535
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,360
have a question for you Alex because you

536
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,460
mentioned it depends what kind of

537
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,259
basically patient population you come

538
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,880
from is it more the patient population

539
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:31,919
that matters whether you're in the

540
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,260
police force or whether you're a veteran

541
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,940
rather than your personal so what

542
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,220
happened good question it all started

543
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,659
with post-traumatic stress disorder the

544
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,980
veterans it showed how much it helped

545
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,799
and now others are like wait a minute we

546
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,298
have PTSD so RCMP Royal Canadian

547
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:47,700
mountain police there are certain type

548
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:49,679
of police so they're now trying it and

549
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,298
uh again the results are so amazing

550
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,919
there's something called polypharma

551
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:54,839
where you take 12 medications to help

552
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,580
with like two conditions cannabis

553
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,918
replaces that and we watched that happen

554
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,019
so I think what's happening is once

555
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,220
people are seeing it we're starting to

556
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,538
see more insurance coverage and that's

557
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,460
the importance of like research and

558
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,558
education because once people see it

559
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,880
they see actually it could be very

560
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,019
beneficial and save the money because

561
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,120
they're all about making money insurance

562
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,500
companies and that's okay we have to

563
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,779
show them that cannabis can actually be

564
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,359
cost effective for them and get people

565
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:21,298
back to work faster

566
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,158
it's it's similar in Switzerland where

567
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:25,440
we see that medical cannabis can replace

568
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,419
one of the pitches basically of the

569
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,179
industry to say there's a possibility

570
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:33,538
with medical cannabis to replace other

571
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:35,220
medication in a multi-medication setup

572
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:37,379
um but and that's the economic

573
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,819
background that needs to be shown and

574
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,799
evidenced

575
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:42,359
um but in terms of health insurance it's

576
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,639
very important also to show the

577
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,099
individual patient journey and to

578
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,200
document that Journey with strong data

579
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:52,740
and the better you can underwrite that

580
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,659
data and send your special because the

581
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,480
basis is it's not reimbursed that's

582
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,340
where it starts so you need to convince

583
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,798
your health insurance on an individual

584
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:04,980
basis that it is actually helping the

585
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,558
patient with with health and that it's

586
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,819
also economical

587
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,079
please do collect the data that's so

588
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:12,058
important we weren't really doing that

589
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,319
that much yeah I think that could be a

590
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,639
really good good start because the data

591
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,859
speaks for itself you can't argue with

592
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,679
the data exactly and we've been doing

593
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,079
that with with a client of mine in one

594
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,940
specific case and it's been working

595
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,918
really well and we wrote down all the

596
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,259
data and so on and the patient got

597
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,538
reimbursement there's also a patients

598
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:32,279
Association that helps with the

599
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:34,140
processes

600
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,178
um which is very important as well but

601
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,759
we're getting there and the insurances

602
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:41,340
are opening up they realize that this

603
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,519
could have economic value for them as

604
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:43,519
well

605
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:53,279
I knew it

606
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,038
okay thank you and Alex I would like to

607
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,980
ask you um how do the recreational and

608
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:01,740
medical markets collect six and

609
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,419
how was the transaction yeah so this is

610
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,700
a question I get asked a lot uh you know

611
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,140
when I'm in Germany and even here uh

612
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,000
people are saying like what happens when

613
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,679
you go from medical to recreational and

614
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,720
I'll try to kind of give you a very

615
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,340
brief answer to this is that

616
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,600
um it was very tricky a lot of people

617
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:17,519
who were pretending they were medical

618
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,158
quickly took off their medical head

619
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,538
burned it and just put on the wreck hat

620
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,000
and he was like yippee let's go make

621
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:26,038
millions it didn't work out that way but

622
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,500
you realize what people's kind of

623
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,538
intentions are very quickly

624
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,159
um and like there's a few kind of

625
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:35,819
examples like for example like

626
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,559
milligrams of THC for for medical uh is

627
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:39,119
the same as with recreational like it's

628
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,940
still the 10 10 milligrams for Edibles

629
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,678
as an example and the way things are

630
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,360
sold that's another big difference like

631
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,940
with medical we were selling it directly

632
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,158
to patients from licensed producers now

633
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,600
with recreational we sell it directly to

634
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,780
the government so for example with my

635
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,399
Edibles company loosh what we do is we

636
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:57,658
sell it to the government and then the

637
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,940
government sells it to the recreational

638
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,740
stores on the medical aside we can sell

639
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,900
directly like for example with my

640
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,419
Pharmacy hybrid Farm we sell directly to

641
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,000
hybrid farm so medical does have a lot

642
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,980
of advantages but we need to educate

643
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,440
people on it like you can get reimbursed

644
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,759
on your taxes by doing medical so

645
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,500
there's a few things like that but we

646
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,019
believe with insurance coverage with

647
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,140
increase of milligrams of THC for

648
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,400
Edibles as an example uh for uh there's

649
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,860
just a few things that we're waiting for

650
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,480
like uh taxes we're taxed equally for

651
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,278
medical and recreational but if

652
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,558
something is a medicine in Canada there

653
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,019
are no taxes on medicine so it feels

654
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:36,240
very weird to say all medical is not

655
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,819
taxed while medicine is not taxed except

656
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,960
cannabis so these are some of the kind

657
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:42,599
of growing pains that we're going

658
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,460
through from that transition but it's

659
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,778
still great and really like Germany and

660
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,640
all these other countries that are doing

661
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:50,099
this transition I think can learn from

662
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,360
it and it's it's very exciting to kind

663
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,099
of see and now medical is going to

664
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,199
slowly pick up again and Rex is going to

665
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:57,839
Plateau off and hopefully we'll have a

666
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,700
good Market fingers crossed thank you

667
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,819
thank you what about in the United

668
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,980
States Santiago in the U.S I think it's

669
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:06,720
very similar to Canada since again it's

670
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,339
not a medical market so you don't have

671
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,579
to take any products through clinical

672
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:14,599
trials the standard of quality for wreck

673
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:17,038
and Med is very similar I'll talk about

674
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:19,619
Colorado as an example so there's some

675
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,599
states that like it's hard to understand

676
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,459
the difference right no difference in

677
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,519
milligram percentage no difference in

678
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,919
traceability in Colorado they decided to

679
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:32,339
separate medical and recreational at the

680
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,320
seed which makes business Logistics a

681
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,599
little complex but you have to decide

682
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,339
when you plant that seed or take the

683
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,859
Clone if it's going to be medical

684
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,778
throughout its whole journey and only be

685
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,119
sold in a medical dispensary or if it's

686
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:47,700
going to be recreational even though the

687
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,079
product could be exactly the same in

688
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,480
Colorado there is a difference between

689
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,119
milligram for example an edible on the

690
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,519
medical side can be up to 500 milligrams

691
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,798
whereas on the recreational side it

692
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,319
could only be up to a hundred and tax

693
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,839
are different as well medical does get

694
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,639
taxed that's important lower than the

695
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,019
recreational yeah and that that's really

696
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,299
important you know one thing that was

697
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,798
driving us crazy is that you can buy a

698
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:13,440
bottle of oil that has a thousand

699
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,298
milligrams and just chug it down but we

700
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,919
can make we make like a loss energy this

701
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:19,019
has 10 milligrams and the government's

702
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,580
really scared about how many pieces but

703
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:22,379
I said wait a minute you have a thousand

704
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,720
milligram oil you can chug you have to

705
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,919
eat you know 100 of these lozenges to

706
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,538
have the same amount think about how

707
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,700
much work that is and you're worried

708
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,558
about protecting so you know I think one

709
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,940
thing that's if you've been here all day

710
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,200
you've heard about Spain and all the

711
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,880
different countries you know the

712
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,220
government they make rules that don't

713
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,659
make sense and that's normal you're not

714
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,579
going to get away from it but we almost

715
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,200
have to work with our stupid rules and

716
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:45,658
slowly let them figure it out themselves

717
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,278
that what the right answer is banging

718
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,620
your head against the wall and spending

719
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,419
money on lobbying could be helpful but

720
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,399
ultimately the only way they're going to

721
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,538
change is by seeing that the sky is not

722
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,460
falling that's kind of what happened

723
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:57,480
when wreck happened feel like oh now

724
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,798
everyone's going to get high when

725
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,839
medical happens oh now everyone's gonna

726
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,339
and they realize the same people who are

727
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,019
getting high before are still getting

728
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,778
high and the people that weren't before

729
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:09,918
are still not that interested so you

730
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,919
know that's kind of what happens

731
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,140
requirements to to get a medical license

732
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:25,080
um yeah I mean it's uh in fact our uh

733
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,120
our regulates are really solid I mean we

734
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,759
know exactly what we can do in order to

735
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,278
achieve the the license I mean you need

736
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,038
to comply with the ghcp or the GMP

737
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:38,159
depending depending on what you you want

738
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:40,379
to grow or to manufacture

739
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,179
um getting the the security done I mean

740
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,120
traceability also is really really

741
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,798
important I mean our health I mean the

742
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,259
health authority is looking for

743
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,900
traceability quality of the product and

744
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:54,960
making sure that you are not doing it

745
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,440
for the black market for example

746
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,778
um so I would say that the security the

747
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,600
quality and the traceability are the the

748
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:05,659
key factors to get the license obviously

749
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,519
you need to have a really strong team

750
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:11,640
the knowledge of what you are doing next

751
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,879
because otherwise you will just be there

752
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,120
and your your your projects will be on

753
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,960
hold for eternity for example it happens

754
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:24,058
it is happening actually at the moment

755
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,058
some companies are trying to figure out

756
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:29,339
how they will move forward with the with

757
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:32,940
the project but yeah in terms of

758
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:35,339
requirements it's quite quite simple

759
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,038
um but yeah anyway it takes a lot of

760
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,740
time again to to do everything because

761
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:43,440
even if you have a project and a

762
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,778
business plan you know exactly what you

763
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,700
are doing you need to go I mean you need

764
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:49,759
to build all the project all the

765
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,919
facilities getting the people there

766
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:56,579
working really hard on the Sops to to

767
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,960
comply with the ghcp or GMP

768
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:59,699
um and only after that you get the

769
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,220
license and you can start growing and

770
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,778
you can start selling so I would say

771
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,000
that the business plan is really

772
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:08,038
important because you'll spend a lot of

773
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,220
money in the meantime and you don't have

774
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:14,640
any kind of Revenue so but in terms of

775
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:18,480
from the requirements itself it's uh

776
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,960
it's quite tough understandable and

777
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,120
um achievable and like in Spain you you

778
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,140
need to have the the product sell salt

779
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:30,959
already yeah yeah I mean you need to

780
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,538
have someone uh from the the the Medical

781
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,058
Market I mean they need to be already

782
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:38,879
licensed it it have someone that it

783
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:41,759
intends to buy your products I mean it's

784
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,440
not a binding contract but again you

785
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,359
need to have someone that it is

786
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,278
interesting in buying your product as

787
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,798
well yeah okay actually the same as in

788
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,019
Colombia uh Colombia also made a similar

789
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,579
rule which we won't get into here but it

790
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,859
doesn't make sense it doesn't work

791
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,538
people can't buy a product eight months

792
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,979
in advance when they can they need to

793
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:00,000
buy it today they don't know what the

794
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,919
price is going to be in eight months

795
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,898
exactly so you know unfortunately

796
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,240
sometimes people make rules that they

797
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:07,678
don't actually intend on working and we

798
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,859
have to always be very careful of that

799
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,559
uh this is this is at least in Portugal

800
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:17,398
is a is a pharmaceutical Market you know

801
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:19,798
so they want to what we try to tell is

802
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:23,099
they want papers you know they want the

803
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:26,099
seops all the the non-binding contracts

804
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:27,839
all the the concerts with a lot of the

805
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,178
the people that are working on their

806
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,220
facilities so they like papers that's

807
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,620
easy just roadblocks and not to get all

808
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,899
conspiracy theory here but like for

809
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:38,759
example Germany uh the pharmaceutical

810
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,798
industry has a seat at the table in

811
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,839
cannabis legalization so when you put

812
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,298
someone at the table that has a vested

813
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,558
interest in your lack of success it

814
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:47,940
creates a lot of problems so whenever

815
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,558
people wonder like wait why are they

816
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,179
making these rules these are stupid it's

817
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:52,500
not going to work it's because usually

818
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,880
they're made by people that don't want

819
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,460
them to work and we have to understand

820
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,559
it and work with it not just say ah and

821
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,720
Sue and get pissed off and just say okay

822
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,398
we're going to make it work and slowly

823
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,399
change it the other way exactly yeah

824
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,038
okay but they introduced a new system

825
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,079
which is like two tiered so you have to

826
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,419
get the general license to be able to

827
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:17,639
produce and cultivate cannabis and then

828
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:20,038
a single cultivation license on top of

829
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,659
that for each grow which makes it a bit

830
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:24,419
more complicated but it's it's actually

831
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,640
a good system and then you can transfer

832
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,440
and sell that to another company that

833
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,659
also has a license to handle narcotic

834
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,240
drugs and from there you can actually

835
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,880
start do distribution you need an extra

836
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,220
license to export and this is maybe

837
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,320
where an interesting thing happens is

838
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,798
where the various terms of what medical

839
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,898
cannabis means in Switzerland and in

840
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:48,000
nearby countries diverge so in

841
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:50,658
Switzerland the production of medical

842
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,398
cannabis has to be under ghcp

843
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:55,500
rules at least the flower

844
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,379
but the interesting part is that the

845
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,859
drying then and the drying part is is

846
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:04,740
considered a GMP step okay and in some

847
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:07,740
other countries the drying process is

848
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,140
not considered GMP so but essentially I

849
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,519
would say if if one if you want to be a

850
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,278
serious player in this market you need

851
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,500
to have a GMP set up you need to be able

852
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,079
to dry your product you can Outsource

853
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,700
that step and then from there on you can

854
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,798
go into distribution that's one of the

855
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,659
things by the way that changed in this

856
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,579
legislation last year is that

857
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,278
Switzerland now is a or swiss producers

858
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:32,278
can now export medical cannabis okay

859
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,319
which I would like to know and as just

860
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,480
one thing so yeah in Portugal for

861
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,278
example you can you can be ghcp

862
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,159
certified and you can do all the process

863
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,919
from seed to cell so we don't need to be

864
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:47,100
GMB certified to to try the pro to try

865
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,440
the flower but obviously if you want to

866
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:52,558
you can do that although it will take

867
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,179
you an extra time an extra license so

868
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,639
normally the companies will start with

869
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:58,980
the jacp and you want two years they

870
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,740
they move forward with the GMP but it's

871
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,960
it's hard to to get it and what about

872
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,659
the final products you can produce in

873
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,878
Portugal is flower instructions I mean

874
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:12,659
in Portugal you can do I would say

875
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:16,440
whatever you want with the independently

876
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,179
of the level of THC or even CBD it's a

877
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,139
matter of telling the authorities what

878
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:24,059
you are you are growing or manufacturing

879
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:27,838
and after that they will they will grant

880
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:31,378
you the the license okay good

881
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:34,079
um and for um Alexander and Santiago and

882
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,940
because the regulations in Canada and US

883
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,940
they've been going on for for a long

884
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,679
time what would you change in the law it

885
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,720
is something you would yeah so I'm gonna

886
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,260
go before Alex because I think he'll

887
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,759
speak longer than me but uh in the U.S I

888
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,399
think the majority of people don't or

889
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,960
didn't know what gacp or GMP meant

890
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,940
because they didn't need to right

891
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,220
they're different across States and

892
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,260
Florida they gave out seven licenses to

893
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,019
begin so you needed like 30 years of

894
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,400
agricultural land 50 million Escrow in

895
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,639
the bank in order to get a license

896
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,099
obviously it's uh you know only a few

897
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,960
people can play in a state like that in

898
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:12,240
Oklahoma you needed two thousand dollars

899
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,519
in a dream and anybody could get a

900
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,679
cannabis license and the products you

901
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,980
can produce are pretty much uh any

902
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:22,199
products so in the US it's definitely an

903
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,780
interesting an interesting mix of of

904
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,838
Dynamics and what I would change to your

905
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,300
point is probably raise the level of

906
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,578
professionalism in the medical industry

907
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,980
without completely killing it the way

908
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,440
that other countries are are doing right

909
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:40,079
but we we definitely need to at least be

910
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,760
under gacp and GMP standards if we're

911
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,579
going to call the industry a medical

912
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,859
industry so I would I would

913
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:49,920
at least want a little more

914
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:52,259
differentiation between recreational and

915
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,119
medical now I'm grateful for the way

916
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,520
things happen because it opened up the

917
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,039
market significantly for for good and

918
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,358
bad mostly good

919
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,679
pioneer as well I think in Switzerland

920
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,598
also there's going to be some

921
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,219
differentiation in terms of products

922
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,140
because you've been asking before about

923
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:09,419
the legalized market and so we're also

924
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:12,059
doing that in Switzerland we're in on in

925
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,420
a process of legalizing uh non-medical

926
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:17,338
adult use yeah

927
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,500
so that's gonna happen but

928
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:22,078
I think one of the differentiators will

929
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,960
probably be that cannabis flour for

930
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,200
smoking and also for vaporization will

931
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,079
probably be more uh pretty prevalent in

932
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:33,179
the um in the recreational you know

933
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,519
non-medical markets that makes sense and

934
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:41,039
and other products like oils tinctures

935
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,639
you know capsules and and all other

936
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,779
forms maybe even Edibles at some stage

937
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:47,519
they will be reserved for the medical

938
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,619
Market yeah as it should be and just

939
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,239
quickly on that 85 of all our products

940
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,400
at the pharmacy are sold are not flour

941
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,799
and I'm so happy to hear that it took a

942
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,358
long time so super fast rapid fire I had

943
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,680
to make a quick note on it because

944
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,239
honestly I can think of a thousand

945
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,699
things that I would change but just

946
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,259
super quickly uh dangers of the wrong

947
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,779
investor you talk about how expensive

948
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,180
this is if you find the wrong investor

949
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,980
you're screwed you find an investor who

950
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:12,480
wants their money ASAP or pretends they

951
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,920
do oh we're going to give you time but

952
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,780
then as soon as they invest they start

953
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,220
whipping you that's going to kill you so

954
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,140
one thing I would change is maybe better

955
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:20,338
access to the funding for this because

956
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:23,039
that's very important we're finding ways

957
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:25,139
to make it less expensive to do uh also

958
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,639
the challenge is the illicit market and

959
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:28,440
the government I think a lot of times

960
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,879
people are looking at competition there

961
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,320
is no competition when you're building a

962
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,579
market you need to actually be friends

963
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,039
with the competitors and build this

964
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,839
together because your competitors are

965
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,179
really the old way of doing things and

966
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,279
also uh the government so working

967
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:43,858
together and making the pie and then

968
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,180
cutting it up so I know we'll have too

969
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:47,039
much more time but changing of

970
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,299
perception is really important 75

971
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,759
percent of people are buying legal

972
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,099
cannabis now it used to be 35 in 2019

973
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,960
2018. so we've come a long way and

974
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,519
that's also going to help change

975
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,769
um so hopefully we left some time for

976
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,420
questions from the audience

977
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:03,420
[Music]

978
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,420
yes

979
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,820
yes of course okay everybody in the back

980
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:13,440
she's got she's been waving her hand

981
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,579
in five minutes so

982
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,159
you always gotta leave time for

983
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,260
questions for these fine people to to

984
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,000
see what we can tell them

985
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,440
and we're available after also and at

986
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,420
the after party but probably talk to us

987
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,039
early at the after party uh for best

988
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,338
answers yeah if you have any questions

989
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,539
go to Alex yeah I'm joking I'm around as

990
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:32,039
well

991
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:35,759
hi

992
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:37,800
um uh I'm Laura I come from

993
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,400
you and I just moved to Spain this past

994
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,619
September I was an acupuncturist and I

995
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,300
work with people with cancer for the

996
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,900
last 10 years

997
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:52,560
a lot of my people did the RSO oil

998
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,940
protocol they decided not to do the

999
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,400
chemotherapy

1000
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:01,380
and some of these people are still well

1001
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:04,858
and alive so I can't wait

1002
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,680
until there is enough research to

1003
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:10,019
realize that we have a medicine

1004
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:15,118
to stop cancer

1005
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:16,199
so where are you guys with the data the

1006
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,960
people

1007
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:22,679
is this been talked about with the

1008
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,199
chemotherapy companies where are we with

1009
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,000
all of this thank you all done with a

1010
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,858
real quick answer on this in general I

1011
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,059
never talk about curing cancer with

1012
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:31,440
cannabis because obviously there's not

1013
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:34,559
enough research but we help a lot of

1014
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,480
side effects of treatment and uh symptom

1015
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,119
management and like dealing with like

1016
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,858
sleep pain things of the treatment so

1017
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,019
that's the first thing I there's a Dr

1018
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:45,119
Sanchez out of Madrid that has done some

1019
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:47,099
unbelievable research about cancer cells

1020
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,800
committing suicide with cannabinoids but

1021
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:52,500
again super preliminary and the problem

1022
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,359
is we can't build a business of an

1023
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,920
industry of cannabis with stories like

1024
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,838
this because the right away the doctor's

1025
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,760
like ah you know so I never talked about

1026
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,400
curing anything it got us to this point

1027
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,500
I'm super excited to hope that this is

1028
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,500
going to be something but it it's

1029
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,660
yeah yeah no it could be very useful in

1030
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:14,759
RSO shout out to Rick Simpson Canadian

1031
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:16,500
uh who uh you know that's named after

1032
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,000
him who still survived I told him he

1033
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,260
only had a few months left to live and

1034
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
he's still alive and they named an oil

1035
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,859
after him so there's obviously something

1036
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,780
very special there

1037
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:26,279
um and we need to talk about it but we

1038
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,140
don't lead with it if we lead with it

1039
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,060
right away people are like ah yeah this

1040
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:32,098
is all snake oil I don't know snake oil

1041
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:33,539
means anything to anyone here is that is

1042
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,880
that a European thing too or no is that

1043
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:38,039
just us so anyways so just people think

1044
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,780
it's [ __ ] I would comment real quick

1045
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:41,880
I think unfortunately the United States

1046
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,619
is not the right industry to collect

1047
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,920
that type of data because they're too

1048
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:49,200
far gone in their therapeutic quasi

1049
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,079
recreational medical industry so they

1050
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,239
don't have the incentives really to need

1051
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,820
to collect this data and do these

1052
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,279
studies but they do have enough people

1053
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,099
consuming and enough similar stories

1054
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,280
like this where if the data were to be

1055
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:07,980
collected it could be completely world

1056
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,019
changing but I hope that other countries

1057
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,719
that are still trying to push these

1058
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:16,079
regulations forward do put these studies

1059
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:19,618
and this data first in order to change

1060
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,420
that stigma quicker yeah I would I'm

1061
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,280
half Israeli so I'm a bit biased here

1062
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,700
but I would also recommend to check out

1063
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,720
some of the research of uh

1064
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:30,358
Professor daddy made at the University

1065
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:32,219
of Haifa maybe there's a few others as

1066
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:35,039
well but I know there's uh being for

1067
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:38,838
example he's been talking about and a

1068
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:42,960
study that he made for colon cancer and

1069
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:45,119
where the use of certain strains led to

1070
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,039
a retraction of metastasis in the body

1071
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,380
and stuff like that I mean I've heard a

1072
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,500
lot of stories but obviously and I agree

1073
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,079
fully with what Alex said that

1074
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,719
that's not how the industry should

1075
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,280
position itself now there's there's so

1076
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:01,439
much research that needs to be done

1077
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,240
there's lower hanging fruit with things

1078
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,700
we know for sure like chronic pain like

1079
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,979
sleep like nausea increase of appetite

1080
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:09,899
these are like for sure easy ones and

1081
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,760
the doctors are behind it so that's why

1082
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,559
but Laura happy to talk to you after I

1083
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,700
have some more thoughts on it and find

1084
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:16,559
me for sure also from personal

1085
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:19,679
experience with friends of mine who have

1086
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,420
been through chemotherapy and have used

1087
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,159
cannabis extensively and it really

1088
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,838
helped them during

1089
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,118
um yeah during during that time

1090
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:28,259
fantastic we have another one over here

1091
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,200
yeah

1092
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,119
hello I have a question for Daniel but

1093
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,279
also for all the panel

1094
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,320
um I would like to know specifically for

1095
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,140
Switzerland but I can see that Germany

1096
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,960
also is taking the same direction why

1097
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:45,239
for the medical Market the government

1098
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,220
allows importation of products from

1099
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,098
outside from Cannabis but for the

1100
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:51,480
recreational not I mean the the testing

1101
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,059
that is done in the recreation is the

1102
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,039
only local production Germany when when

1103
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,799
they draw the first proposal of the law

1104
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,318
it seems to go in that direction uh why

1105
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,460
is that I mean because it should be the

1106
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:04,259
opposite because the recreational

1107
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,960
consumers would like to have some

1108
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,700
variety yeah I can answer that pretty

1109
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,980
quickly in Switzerland recreational

1110
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:12,960
Cannabis or I would say non-medical

1111
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,858
adult use cannabis as I've been taught

1112
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,838
is not legal yet so in the context of

1113
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:21,059
scientific studies there are now pilot

1114
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:24,539
studies that were opened up there's the

1115
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:26,759
first trials in Basel where you know

1116
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:30,960
cannabis red cannabis is being dispensed

1117
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:34,440
in pharmacies it's essentially there's a

1118
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,920
a substitute there's a clause in that

1119
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,900
ordinance that says if not enough

1120
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,619
production can be procured locally to

1121
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,900
satisfy those trials in the context of a

1122
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:48,358
scientific study then it can resort to

1123
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,460
importation and we're not there yet

1124
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:52,199
because Switzerland obviously is in a

1125
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,780
position and has enough companies that

1126
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:58,139
can procure relatively low levels and

1127
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:00,000
low amounts of of cannabis and in a

1128
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:02,159
medical space obviously it's it's an

1129
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,900
open market because it's medical and we

1130
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,299
also have the international legal

1131
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,639
Frameworks to facilitate these

1132
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,039
cross-border movements of of medical

1133
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,779
cannabis and also just really quick the

1134
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,940
answer is very simple for you and we can

1135
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,500
talk after longer version but it's the

1136
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,818
answers business and they're protecting

1137
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,260
their business I come from a country

1138
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:20,880
where we're protecting our business

1139
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,380
right now we don't allow for importation

1140
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,420
of cannabis and a lot of people are

1141
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,460
pretty upset that Canada is exporting

1142
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,838
but we're not allowing for import we're

1143
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,639
protecting our Industries which people

1144
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,199
spend hundreds of millions of dollars on

1145
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:32,818
and many investors already lost so much

1146
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,559
money so it's a way of protecting the

1147
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:36,059
industry and the German tender hasn't

1148
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,460
even come up yet there's rumors of this

1149
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:39,900
we'll see what happens but you know what

1150
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,699
whatever they do will start that

1151
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,500
Germany's capable of producing all the

1152
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:45,179
varieties you've ever dreamed of at the

1153
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,260
best qualities may be a little more

1154
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:48,118
expensive because they have a higher

1155
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,680
cost there but everything is possible

1156
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,960
don't let anyone tell you otherwise

1157
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,940
that's for sure I can just chip in one

1158
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,220
more salt as a previous Commodities

1159
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,980
Trader I'm actually very much a

1160
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:00,899
proponent of cross-order trade I'm not a

1161
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,059
big fan of protectionism I don't think

1162
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,980
it's something that that will last for a

1163
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:06,358
long time but in these industries I

1164
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,179
really think that you have to brace

1165
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:13,380
yourself for a period at least a period

1166
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:15,960
of some form mixed or full protectionism

1167
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,059
when the markets open up and in Germany

1168
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,500
it seems to go in the same direction I

1169
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:21,000
would like to say as an enjoyer of

1170
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,219
Moroccan hash

1171
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,199
and Spanish wine I would also like to

1172
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:27,179
see global

1173
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,059

1174

1175
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:33,960

1177
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,760

1178
