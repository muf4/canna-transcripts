hello everyone

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,039
thanks for listening it's a very dry

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,399
topic so we're going to try and make it

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,198
exciting

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,879
my name is fleeta i am the ceo of little

00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,798
it was originally an australian company

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,640
we are listed on the australian

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,040
securities exchange

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,960
but we also have a large operation in

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
denmark so we are exporting our

33
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,879
medicines

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,798
mainly across europe but also australia

35
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,039
and australasia

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
yeah so really excited to be here and i

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,320
can contribute quite a lot to the

38
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,519
complexities that the entire globe poses

39
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,959
in terms of

40
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,000
quality standards it's been very

41
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,000
difficult to navigate

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,719
hi i'm marisa chess i'm also a lawyer

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
colleague of daniel i'm french and based

44
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,519
in paris

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,520
i originally focused on life sciences

46
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,719
rehabilitary

47
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:56,879
law and moved to cannabis three and a

48
00:01:52,719 --> 00:02:00,640
half years ago when it reached europe

49
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:03,039
so yeah i'm helping those guys trying to

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
figure out how to navigate the complex

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,360
regulatory framework

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,199
and yeah we'll discuss a very

53
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,680
interesting and dry topic today

54
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,959
hi everybody my name is

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,920
i founded demican in 2017 which is the

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,479
only german company that is allowed to

57
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,439
operate in all verticals in germany and

58
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,318
europe

59
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,280
and

60
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,639
i take the topic out today and

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,719
i'm really

62
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,039
excited because the topic of today

63
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,439
quality quality standards on the global

64
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,439
level are so important and nobody

65
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,878
realizes it so if you listen to our

66
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,120
politicians before

67
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,359
i think they thought about it but they

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,039
didn't address it to you guys in their

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,840
panel and i think it's over your time

70
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,878
so the subject today is the quest for

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,200
what global cannabis standard this may

72
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,039
suggest that there is no global cannabis

73
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,399
standards at all today

74
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,158
of course we all know that there are a

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
lot of standards already in the market

76
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,560
then the medical markets the

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,479
recreational markets they all overlap

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,318
we're trying to figure out now which

79
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,158
standards we're talking about in the

80
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,560
first place so maybe

81
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,000
you guys can tell me which standards are

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,719
we talking about

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,719
at all here

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,039
well that's an interesting question

85
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,479
itself so i think um probably a place to

86
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,919
start will be

87
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,119
you know there are a couple of different

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,878
or many different monographs for a start

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,439
you've got a couple of general

90
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,158
monographs like the eu monograph and

91
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,280
then we've got the us monograph um so we

92
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,598
have these little global

93
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,680
conglomerates of uh pharmacopoeias but

94
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,318
then you've also got national autographs

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,560
as well so each country sometimes even

96
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,158
each state or individual can have their

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,360
own monograph

98
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,759
and which one rules you know the ich

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
guidelines actually probably sit on top

100
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,679
of all of those standards

101
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,158
but then of course underneath those

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,959
you've got the eugmp which is looking

103
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,959
you know the api and medicinal products

104
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,000
you've got starting materials which is

105
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,080
more around the gacp side of things so

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
when we start talking about standards

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,239
there are so many different things that

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,238
we can sort of unpack i guess from there

109
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
and it's knowing which one rules in the

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,238
country that you're

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,319
working in or trying to consider

112
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,959
when you speak about the monographs

113
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,519
you're referring to quality standards in

114
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,239
first instance that are relevant for

115
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,599
the pharmacists absolutely yes i am

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,439
talking so there are many different

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
standards you could i think we've sort

118
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,000
of discussed earlier there's esg there's

119
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,839
all sorts of standards but i'm just at

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,279
the moment referring to the quality

121
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,839
standards

122
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,959
in terms of the final final products and

123
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,039
preparations so that uh you can export

124
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,079
these and you have we have global

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,759
patients

126
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,839
and when you're talking about global

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,479
patients there really needs to be a

128
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,599
global standard a baseline standard that

129
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,599
everybody uh can refer to because we

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,240
need to have the same efficacy the same

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,080
quality controls the same safety

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,639
you know it needs to be an even playing

133
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,478
field so i think that that's probably

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,918
the topic today that we'll look to

135
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,079
unpack is along those quality lines

136
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,399
yeah and i really agree with you

137
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,439
when you say like we have like global

138
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,519
patience and that's the key um coming

139
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,279
from a pharmaceutical background

140
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,680
i can relate to

141
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,879
this issue is that the patients and

142
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,199
therapeutic indications that are elected

143
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,759
for medical cannabis are

144
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,038
similar in many countries

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
but when it comes to quality and safety

146
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,478
of the products

147
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,319
we can see that from one part of the

148
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,719
world to another one

149
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,159
the criterias vary and the quality

150
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,320
varies

151
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,840
dmp yes it's a very standard word if i

152
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,120
can say but

153
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,839
it's gmp north america is different from

154
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
gmp in europe for instance

155
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,038
so

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,840
even though there may be agreements on

157
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,399
importation depending on countries and

158
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,318
we were discussing just in europe there

159
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,839
are so many differences from a country

160
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,879
to another that

161
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,359
um

162
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,519
there's there's still issues technically

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
speaking when it comes to

164
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,639
bringing products from a country to

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
another

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,519
so

167
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:27,918
there are standards um they exist uh

168
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,359
some countries are more open than others

169
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,519
than them

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,439
that being said just to put the french

171
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,359
example where medical cannabis is still

172
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,879
not legalized but they're already

173
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,120
started publishing laws um in

174
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,680
you know because they're we're expecting

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
legalization next year hopefully

176
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
um

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,439
they they

178
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,240
speak about eu gmps and

179
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,319
any other equivalent standards that

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,120
would be recognized internationally this

181
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,598
is a very wide wording

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,680
and eventually technically speaking any

183
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,240
company that would like to bring in

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
their products as many companies in

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,160
france will have to have their entire

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
dossier

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
assessed by the competent health

188
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,080
authority

189
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
so

190
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,000
it seems

191
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
easy on the paper in the reality it's

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
going to be in fleeta who is part

193
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,560
actually your company is part of the

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
the pilot program currently you i'm sure

195
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,639
you can talk about the difficulties you

196
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,159
faced when fighting the

197
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,519
and submitting the dossier and

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,560
everything you had to go through with

199
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,038
the ansm to to have your standards

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,120
recognized and approved

201
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,199
just to take a step back because we're

202
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,639
already diving right into the medical

203
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,160
markets

204
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,199
are these standards that you just

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
mentioned

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,038
a good

207
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,959
sort of base way for

208
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,199
the recreational markets to create

209
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,878
products in the recreation markets going

210
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
forward do you think that should be the

211
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,840
basis

212
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,839
most should there be yes

213
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,079
absolutely i think we should talk about

214
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,198
what we want what we would want to

215
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,279
achieve with a global cannabis standard

216
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,598
i think uh we can all agree that we

217
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,159
would like the commodity cannabis to

218
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,439
freely flow from a to e all around the

219
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,520
globe and taking advantage of

220
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,519
favorable climates

221
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:24,079
favorable cost structures etc etc so

222
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,878
what would be necessary for that one is

223
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:30,478
quality assurance standard

224
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,560
so eugp by no means is anyway how to

225
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,879
define your specification

226
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,478
it actually is

227
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,439
a certificate you earn by the government

228
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,080
for

229
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,240
producing in a way that assures constant

230
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,320
quality and that you're able to learn

231
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,720
from your failures so

232
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,360
if this is the most common

233
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,000
definition of eugp and i think we all

234
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,278
agree that everybody who's producing

235
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,639
cannabis should buy to this standard

236
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:03,120
this mindset or this rules of eugp

237
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,360
because it's helping patients and it

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
will help consumers

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,519
it also

240
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
uh the interaction possibilities of all

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,879
companies around the globe because then

242
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
you can actually

243
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,519
go from

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
one country with your product to the

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,959
other

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,879
so quality assurance then we come to

247
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,439
specification and i think here it's

248
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,600
really crucial because for us purchasing

249
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,399
product from all around the globe

250
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,560
we always face this challenge that

251
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,480
first of all the

252
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,319
yield

253
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,120
that you achieve in one country or the

254
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
other might differ but there's also mold

255
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
so you want to have a specification of

256
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,838
cannabis all around the globe what is

257
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,240
the allowed threshold for mold what is

258
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,200
the allowed threshold for yeast what is

259
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,799
the allowed threshold for aerobics what

260
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,560
is the allowed threshold for thc parents

261
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,479
i think those are the four you want to

262
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,479
look for and you want to start

263
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
discussing around the globe what they

264
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,839
should look like should they look like

265
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,440
in germany very tight very strict so

266
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,000
we're importing beautiful product from

267
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
lgp from australia and

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,759
i think we

269
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
agree it's hard to grow something as

270
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,838
high quality as this

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,640
so should that be the standard for

272
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,880
everybody in my humble opinion yes but

273
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,838
it's debatable but we should have like

274
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,278
one

275
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,160
standard there and what is cannabis look

276
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,320
like so you mentioned global trade i was

277
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,278
a commodities trader before i became a

278
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,120
lawyer actually and we traded coal

279
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,120
fertilizer and there was always a spec

280
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
sheet and based on the specifications

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,879
you adapted to price

282
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,879
it was always a direct correlation also

283
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,879
in the letters of credit and so on we're

284
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,000
not there yet in this market but

285
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,639
eventually it's going to become a

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,360
commodity and if commodities move as you

287
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,120
say we need standardized specification

288
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,000
model somehow

289
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
based on which specifications

290
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,480
do you think pricing should be

291
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,680
determined in the cannabis space it's a

292
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
bit

293
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,199
today it's chc it's just thc so higher

294
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,519
thc higher price is that uh

295
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,839
what it should be

296
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,120
what what do you think it should be

297
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,720
let's be creative here um

298
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
cultivation method

299
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,759
should pay off because

300
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,759
what

301
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,838
fleeter is growing in her indoor

302
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,360
greenhouse in australia what damacan is

303
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,760
producing in germany

304
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,000
indoor production environment is a

305
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,000
totally different product from a hybrid

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
greenhouse a hybrid greenhouse means

307
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,440
there is additional lighting but still

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
the product looks different it's more

309
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,720
fluffy it's not as dense the

310
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,120
active ingredients that vary much more

311
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,639
because there might be a cloud over your

312
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,639
greenhouse

313
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,078
so it's a challenge

314
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,319
so i think

315
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,319
cultivation method should pay off thc

316
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,560
level should pay off and turkeys should

317
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,079
pay off and i think they will naturally

318
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,879
do the last two but cultivation method

319
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,679
is not paying off yet

320
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,679
so

321
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,239
cultivation method

322
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,039
indoor highest price greenhouse one a

323
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
little lower outdoor even cheaper

324
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,639
basically yeah i think you could even go

325
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,879
a step further and it probably comes

326
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,440
back a little bit to the differences in

327
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,879
in countries and jurisdictions but i

328
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,680
think for example if you look at

329
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,759
pesticides uh i think in hannah they can

330
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,359
have you know some pesticides are

331
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,759
improved and it has to be at a certain

332
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,480
level whereas in denmark and australia

333
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,078
you cannot use any pesticides you know

334
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,839
and that's um

335
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,039
is that worth more in the final product

336
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,480
look i don't know but it's a

337
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,879
consideration

338
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,200
and i think you know if you look at um

339
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,360
foreign material i think in the us they

340
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
have a max of five percent whereas in

341
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,278
everywhere else it's up to two percent

342
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,360
um aflatoxins i think again uk it's high

343
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,278
in israel it's higher everywhere else

344
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
aflatoxins

345
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,759
so it comes back to this whole we're all

346
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,599
singing from different gimbals right now

347
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,679
and i think once you're all on that

348
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,079
playing field that even playing field

349
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,000
and you have got one standard or

350
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,159
something to

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,759
aspire to then then you can start

352
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,759
looking at okay which

353
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,919
what's the pricing mechanism for these

354
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,480
commodities so perhaps we can have

355
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,719
certain bands one band is for indoor

356
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,440
production with a certain specification

357
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,440
described it second band for greenhouse

358
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
third band for outdoor production all

359
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
with

360
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,159
something like that right

361
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,440
okay let's take a step further maybe you

362
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,958
can give us a little bit of insight into

363
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,560
the challenges of cross-border trade

364
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,439
what you really experience in everyday

365
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,679
life

366
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
because it's very different to export to

367
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,239
germany

368
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,800
to france

369
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,639
what does that mean in practice yeah it

370
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,399
is different it's difficult you've

371
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,600
really got to be across every single

372
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,278
country

373
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,600
and even though they are part of they

374
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,360
might be part of the eu it's every

375
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
country is so different

376
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
so i think because

377
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,439
the requirements are different there are

378
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,159
issues when it comes to release testing

379
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,160
or batch testing um even packaging and

380
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:11,198
storage is difficult

381
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,879
and even knowing where eu gmp starts

382
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,799
with each country i mean who would have

383
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,958
thought that every single country you

384
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,958
know it could be different um and so

385
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,119
that probably needs to be standardized

386
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,719
it is different can you explain that

387
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
just where it starts

388
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,639
you you for example where does the

389
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,800
genius does that where does it yeah and

390
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,799
gfp start

391
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,439
this is the gray area because it depends

392
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:36,479
on the jurisdiction as to where gacp

393
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,720
finishes and where does the eugmp start

394
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,720
um and so this is different literally

395
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
different than every country how was it

396
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
in germany

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,399
so it used to be that well in germany

398
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,560
you have to understand it's two law

399
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
spheres that are governing cannabis as

400
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,759
of today will change in the future

401
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,839
obviously with the recreational

402
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,120
candidates but it's narcotic law and

403
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
it's medical law

404
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,360
and

405
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,838
performance

406
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,240
and pharmaceutical law is handled by the

407
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,000
different states in germany so it's not

408
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,480
federal level but the different states

409
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
so they all have a different view on

410
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,199
that however

411
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,799
as a general note on how it's handled in

412
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:17,039
germany um gacp stops after harvest so

413
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,439
you harvest your product you might

414
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,759
approve trim you take the leaves away

415
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,040
still under gacp and then you take it

416
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,439
into your gdp area and you either dry

417
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,399
first or trip first and then drive a

418
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,279
trim

419
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,120
and then you package and restore so this

420
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,278
is under ut

421
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,639
it was arguable that

422
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,958
drying could also occur in gacp and you

423
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,039
only perform repackaging

424
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,198
there are some of my competitors who are

425
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,399
following this model and

426
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,758
the bee farm has been contemplating and

427
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
publishing

428
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
new

429
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,009
ideas

430
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,838
and

431
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:56,078
[Music]

432
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,560
is pointing in the direction that drive

433
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,359
might have to be under utp

434
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,679
so uh there is yet another idea that the

435
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,720
regulator is coming up with marie in

436
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,319
france well in france right now we only

437
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,360
we're only dealing with finished

438
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,320
products so we don't have this question

439
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,639
yet that being said regarding if we read

440
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,360
the the regulation i mentioned earlier

441
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,519
on cultivation that's enough actually an

442
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
exception to the general prohibition of

443
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,360
cannabis in france

444
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,079
it only mentions

445
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,720
gmp for all the stages

446
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,879
or equivalent

447
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,440
standards so

448
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,838
it will be interesting to see where we

449
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,959
go further with the regulation how they

450
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,959
deal all the difficulties you mentioned

451
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,758
regarding imports

452
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,000
even pricing i come back to the price in

453
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,560
question based on

454
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,958
how you grow the the products and

455
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,599
everything um i think this is going to

456
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,119
be the standard and the quality

457
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,920
standard

458
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,399
as a basis will not be sufficient

459
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,359
depending on countries um each country

460
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,640
has a different way of fixing pricing

461
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,438
for products

462
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,199
and if we regard friends

463
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,919
which is the pain in the neck in the

464
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,160
world regarding pharmaceutical products

465
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,199
and everything because we like to make

466
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,000
things complicated

467
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,798
price fixing for medical cannabis hasn't

468
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,119
been

469
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,599
set up yet so i can't tell you how it's

470
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,399
going to work but if i if we consider it

471
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,199
as a medicinal product

472
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,679
we know how difficult it is to negotiate

473
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,840
with the pricing authority in france so

474
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,240
i don't think it could be part of the

475
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,599
discussion why they're trying to set up

476
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,759
the rules um to use that as a basis but

477
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,558
i do not believe it will be sufficient

478
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,720
and it will be the only criteria to

479
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,119
to have your price set up for your

480
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
products

481
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,439
let's go back to more challenges

482
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,359
in actually bringing product to one of

483
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,240
those countries um

484
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,000
yeah look i think i mean even

485
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,400
yeah where did i get to before oh or

486
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
where the eu

487
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
and then you know that sort of dictates

488
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,720
from there how you import and how you

489
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,360
explore so i think when you look at the

490
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,679
release of the batch testing uh look

491
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,798
just all of those influence how you

492
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,640
actually

493
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,960
when you can import import when you can

494
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,480
explore all of the above

495
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
but i guess when you look at the other

496
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,240
challenges it's more yeah how are you

497
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,918
compliant how are you um

498
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,599
how does technology play a role in this

499
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,200
and that's probably a jumping the gun a

500
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,199
little bit here but

501
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,120
you know in terms of moving forward how

502
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
do we start to standardize these to make

503
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,038
it easier and there's a bit of a

504
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,440
technology play here

505
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,839
i think understanding you know if we're

506
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,400
dealing with italy for example which is

507
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,199
part of the eu australia has a mutual

508
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,798
recognition agreement with the eu

509
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,600
so most times there is a pathway there

510
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,759
um not initially for example and even

511
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,759
though italy is part of the eu you have

512
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,400
to be growing in europe so you have to

513
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,119
have eu gmp to get into into that

514
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,720
country so it's just another example of

515
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,798
of you know the headaches that are

516
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,640
involved with each country but i do

517
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,879
think that um you know as we move

518
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,559
forward

519
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,160
i personally think that there is an

520
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:26,960
absolute need for a global standard it's

521
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,160
critical to address the key

522
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,558
ideas and uh elements in this medical

523
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,880
cannabis industry and so it does need to

524
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:38,079
be standardized which standard do you

525
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,640
use you know is an eu gmp what and who's

526
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,960
going to agree on that but once you do

527
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,360
this is where technology can just be so

528
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,798
helpful for us all moving forward

529
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,879
because if you can have compliance you

530
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,960
can tick some boxes it's going to be

531
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,160
much easier instead of waiting the six

532
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,798
to sometimes up to 18 months to actually

533
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,759
get audited um

534
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:02,720
processed and then start the export the

535
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,720
import processing and permitting cycle

536
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,159
it's it's extraordinary you know the

537
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,000
lengths that you have to go to and i

538
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,679
think uh you know the heart a lot of the

539
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,038
hard work has been done but i think

540
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,759
moving forward it can be more simplified

541
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:19,679
you ask what are the biggest challenges

542
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,440
nowadays and i think one is

543
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,559
you talk to a supplier potential

544
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
supplier

545
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,678
and they start

546
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,279
talking about their amazing product

547
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,759
really amazing product

548
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,599
and they start saying like no mold at

549
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,319
all at least according to our

550
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,918
specifications we are all

551
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,240
and then you look into their

552
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,240
specification and they can have a wall

553
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,798
10 times you can have so you can't

554
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,440
import so this makes very difficult

555
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,879
right now to move for example to

556
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,120
work with a u.s american companies

557
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,280
not that they could technically export

558
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,279
right now but they wouldn't export you

559
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,639
something you could actually import

560
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,000
um but

561
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,480
this is one thing

562
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,558
the other one is testing methods

563
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,360
you can't believe the headache you will

564
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,200
encounter when you start importing and

565
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,719
they tell you

566
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,440
really good stuff it's 30 thc and more

567
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,600
it's really crazy and you bring it over

568
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
find after months and months and

569
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,319
negotiations

570
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,960
and you test it according to eugp

571
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:26,000
uh testing methods to your gym

572
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,400
and you find out it's 23

573
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,400
so there's loads of thc missing because

574
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
the testing methods

575
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,080
so i just

576
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,798
wanted to highlight this testing methods

577
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,960
are as important as specifications to

578
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,599
harmonize in the future i know this very

579
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,120
well from trading because we had certain

580
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:47,439
guys we went to astm for example or iso

581
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,199
and we knew always astm has a bit higher

582
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,840
software it always comes out a bit

583
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,679
higher in code so we know if you want a

584
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,279
lower software we need to go to iso

585
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,200
it's just how it is

586
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,879
and i think this is a really established

587
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,440
market already there are still these

588
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,799
inconsistencies in testing so

589
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,200
i think we're just going to have to find

590
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,119
a way to live with those but we'll agree

591
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
the standard needs to be there so going

592
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,558
back to tech

593
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,280
traceability quality

594
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,879
control quality consistency transparency

595
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,079
all super important

596
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,400
uh factors and killers in this industry

597
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,639
how do you ensure your businesses

598
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,280
that you and are you doing all paper

599
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,759
based or do you have some software

600
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,200
involved like kind of media for example

601
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,759
which is here

602
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,759
how do you do it

603
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
uh

604
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,639
yeah interesting we

605
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,558
when we started so we we

606
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,038
helped pioneer the australian industry

607
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,279
with the first producers

608
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,359
there was nothing that we could use you

609
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,519
know so initially we were sort of using

610
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,759
paper base but then to get the actual

611
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,400
license to cultivate we had to have a

612
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,519
system so we had to go out and design

613
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,280
our own

614
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,279
um and you know

615
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,119
it's not great but it did the job for

616
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,279
what we needed initially

617
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,119
uh it was you know if you're going to

618
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,678
compare a standard it was like having a

619
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,000
hyundai in comparison to a rolls royce

620
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,320
of of quality management systems but we

621
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,679
started where we needed to start

622
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,918
and now that the company is more

623
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,360
established we are have invested in

624
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,440
investing in a big erp system which is

625
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,759
it's not even seen to sale this looks

626
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,720
after every functionality within the

627
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:31,200
business but it is super expensive

628
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,279
um but it does it will give us that

629
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,360
capability to have oversight throughout

630
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,399
the entire business we're virtually

631
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,879
integrated so to have cultivation and

632
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,200
manufacturing as well as our uh doctor

633
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,799
education and patient customer service

634
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,880
side you know it's actually really

635
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,759
really difficult to be across all of

636
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
that

637
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,798
so in denmark we recently applied a

638
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,759
facility a lot of that is paper-based so

639
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,200
we're

640
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,759
changing that across now to a qms system

641
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,759
um but there is you know technology will

642
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,119
play a key role there so i think you'll

643
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,359
find there's been a bit of both in the

644
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,439
industry it's probably rare to have one

645
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,558
software that covers

646
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
all of it

647
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,158
right

648
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,639
but

649
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,679
as long as you have a few that capture

650
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,600
some of the

651
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
supply chain stations

652
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,519
how do you do it

653
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,719
so qr codes

654
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,359
enabling

655
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,400
the customer to track and trace

656
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,719
and to

657
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,038
have upstream traceability in the sense

658
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,519
of you understand what cultivation

659
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:35,119
method is being used or what thc level

660
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:38,158
cd level what terpenes overall and maybe

661
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,879
even better and this is all batch based

662
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,120
what major turkeys and what percentages

663
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,960
are in that batch i think that is very

664
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,399
important for customers and especially

665
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
for patients

666
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
and

667
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,759
you can also use

668
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,919
that technology to actually track

669
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,759
who in the medical market who's

670
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,919
receiving the product imagine you're

671
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,200
using blockchain and

672
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,080
people then have it in the chain

673
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,080
that they're the owner of that unit of

674
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,158
that badge for that thc so when they

675
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,798
encounter the police control they can

676
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,400
actually prove that it is actually the

677
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,960
product they bought in the pharmacy and

678
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,960
not around the

679
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,960
so

680
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,960
one last question here because i see

681
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,200
that time flies and maybe you want to

682
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,720
give the audience an opportunity to ask

683
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,278
a question as well

684
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,240
what's the most urgent area where we

685
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,880
need further study organization

686
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,919
just each one of you wrong

687
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,159
a word

688
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,080
i think as a lawyer

689
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,720
we'll start with the basics

690
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:43,759
quality safety

691
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,558
and traceability for the products and

692
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,079
then the rest will follow um but i think

693
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,319
like

694
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,000
just to be really short on that that the

695
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,519
question is the quest for a global

696
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,038
standard um

697
00:25:53,519 --> 00:26:00,000
global mean word means worldwide

698
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:04,079
i do not think it's entirely ritual but

699
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,798
if we can have an alignment on quality

700
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,359
and safety at least that will definitely

701
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:13,519
open doors and facilitate the movement

702
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,519
of the products across the globe

703
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:19,678
that's a short lawyer's answer

704
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,278
okay that's kind of a difficult question

705
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,960
because the entire this is the whole

706
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,960
quest right is for a global standard

707
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,240
um because we need to make sure

708
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,960
obviously there's the safety and

709
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,359
efficacy et cetera and compliance we

710
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,120
need to make sure our global patients

711
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,959
are protected from adulteration and

712
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,399
variability in the products like it's

713
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,400
absolutely key

714
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,759
um and then this just to be a baseline

715
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,080
study

716
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,480
sorry as a standard you can't literally

717
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,558
have all these variabilities in the

718
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,640
standard we've all got to be playing on

719
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,798
the same and even playing field and

720
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,120
singing from the same people because

721
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,200
otherwise it's just you know we're never

722
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,678
going to get there as a as a global

723
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,679
industry

724
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,720
i think the most important parts have

725
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,960
already been summarized by youtube but

726
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,880
just coming back to the testing methods

727
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,120
i really believe that there needs to be

728
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,159
more discussion about that environment

729
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,399
otherwise

730
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,080
we will encounter

731
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,679
still challenges in the future what are

732
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,759
we going to do about it

733
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,320
whoa

734
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,158
they call it lap to lap alignment that's

735
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,480
like if you're an enterprise and you

736
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,200
want to get along and find a solution uh

737
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,880
it could be regular regular just regular

738
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,319
disalignment

739
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
but you're opening up a whole count of

740
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,158
worms here because lab testing is

741
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,398
different even within countries you know

742
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,159
even within different laboratories

743
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:48,798
there's always a difference and so they

744
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,799
need a standard as well and so it covers

745
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,960
i think we need to bring it to the

746
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,158
attention of the lawmakers and really

747
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,440
pound it in

748
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
all right

749
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,679
questions from the audience maybe one we

750
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,918
have one minute left so it's gonna be a

751
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,919
short one

752
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:15,000
[Applause]

753
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,379
two quick

754
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,679
one is do you

755
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,320
[Music]

756
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,399
have any concerns that what you're doing

757
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,720
with

758
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,798
stacking on standardization on top of

759
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,558
the regulations and laws

760
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,720
that you're going to wipe out any

761
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,798
innovative small business

762
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,720
trying to enter the market

763
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,480
and then second kind of related to that

764
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,720
do you really need anything more than a

765
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,640
consumer safety standard

766
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,480
is there really any real need for

767
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,880
anything more than a consumer safety

768
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,880
standard

769
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,640
uh i guess do you look at all medicines

770
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,398
the same way and say oh any

771
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,080
anyone that's starting

772
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,319
a company and having a pharmaceutical

773
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,439
medicine can just sort of have a

774
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,759
consumer

775
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,519
protection sort of survey or mechanism

776
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:08,398
well but if someone's making beer

777
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,398
we're talking about medicinal cannabis

778
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,239
yeah i think if it was recreation you

779
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,759
know that's a different topic altogether

780
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,079
and adult use

781
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,000
um you know food standards again is a

782
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,079
different topic this is a this is a

783
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,720
pharmaceutical grade medicine

784
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,879
you know it's not

785
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,519
you know in itself i i just

786
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,278
i just think anybody

787
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,960
we're small companies as well that are

788
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,880
starting our journey and we've had to

789
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,038
abide by these rules and i think you

790
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,360
have to have these rules otherwise

791
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,919
you've got this patient

792
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,119
risk in terms of product efficacy and

793
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,320
safety

794
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,079
so i think that there has to be

795
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,558
something yeah what does that look like

796
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,558
i don't know i'm not the expert

797
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,639
but i think that there just has to be

798
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,480
the same standard that we all play from

799
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,440
because all of our countries are

800
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,319
different

801
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,080
and yet we're looking at global patients

802
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,038
so

803
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,278
i i think i may add to that

804
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,278
we if we're talking about medicinal

805
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,440
cannabis which is something completely

806
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,159
different from recreational even though

807
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,798
i agree that a lot of

808
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,399
recreational users are patients

809
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,119
originally but that's a different topic

810
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,278
if

811
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,119
what i often say to company that comes

812
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,200
to me and say hey i want to start

813
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,639
business medicinal cannabis i'm like

814
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,278
okay are you able to think

815
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,360
pharmaceutical if you're not able to

816
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,278
think pharmaceutical

817
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,599
you're not going to make it simply

818
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,839
because and i think both of you can

819
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,359
testify about how much investment you

820
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,959
need to make

821
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:44,000
to build facilities to ensure safety of

822
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,120
insecurity of your facilities

823
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
so

824
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,839
when you ask whether it may wipe out

825
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,759
some

826
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:54,558
small players that would like to enter

827
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:58,158
the market yes it will but

828
00:30:54,558 --> 00:31:00,158
it's it's a very tricky topic and

829
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,080
as a lawyer there's also something that

830
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,679
all the players in the pharmaceutical

831
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,918
medicine

832
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,080
cannabis need to understand it's as soon

833
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,159
as you have patients involved

834
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,960
there's something that we call products

835
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,240
liability that that happens

836
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,600
and

837
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,399
it's

838
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,558
it can cost you like a lot if anything

839
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,439
happens so yes those standards are

840
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,158
critical and really necessary

841
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,600
so

842
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,840
if you look at what eugmp requirement in

843
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,278
germany in europe and the european

844
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,119
pharmacopoeia and the german phone

845
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,480
compare i tuned into the product to the

846
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,798
end result is

847
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,919
in my humble opinion a clean

848
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,158
product

849
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,399
be it for medical or eat for a

850
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,200
recreational so

851
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,918
i

852
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,120
strongly advise us all been interested

853
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,919
in the topic to produce clean products

854
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,879
and it must be via ugp because it makes

855
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,080
sense a lot of sense then that's good

856
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,480
because we will have happy consumers and

857
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,879
happy patients and this is actually what

858
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,360
i want and i think that is important to

859
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,360
me actually

860
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,720
standards or even higher standards than

861
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,480
for pharmaceutical products

862
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,640
because there's a

863
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,640
way of interest in in medicine and toxic

864
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,080
ecological studies actually have to pass

865
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,759
a higher part in foodstuffs regulation

866
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,359
thank you so very much we are a little

867
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,480
bit over time so we can't take another

868
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,909
question but let's hear it again for

869
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,969
