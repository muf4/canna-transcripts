1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,850
oh it's about that time in half the room

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,620
didn't clear out so obviously I'm not

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,939
back home in California welcome to the

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:16,649
4/20 session on that note and definitely

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,739
thank you for all that are hanging out

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:22,890
for the final session here with us

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:25,559
so a quick introduction about myself I'm

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,469
stoked I finally get to be a moderator

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,449
versus a panelist so this is the first

10
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,969
time for me in five years

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,289
my background in the industry originally

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,899
grew up in Northern California so it was

13
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,488
always around the craft in the culture

14
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,890
interesting enough studied chronology in

15
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,988
college so wasn't necessarily the path I

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,768
was originally gonna take but that's a

17
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:49,259
whole other story now currently in the

18
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:52,619
head of the herbal category for Bovada

19
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,718
and formerly director of media at a

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,808
little tech company called weed maps out

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,670
of Southern California and then okay

22
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,488
kind of a big one but and then before

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,140
that started with a friend the first

24
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,658
mainstream news site called the cannabis

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,090
out of a Denver Colorado back when the

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,649
first adult use market started but

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,630
enough about me we'll jump right into

28
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:16,769
our panelists and we will start with

29
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:18,359
ladies first if that's okay gentlemen so

30
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:19,618
we'd like to start off with a Tyler

31
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:24,989
Sally if you could tell us a little bit

32
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:28,438
about yourself and your business I have

33
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:30,359
a cannabis brand called juices 22 it's

34
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,859
well it's a lifestyle brand and

35
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,319
underneath the lifestyle we promote

36
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,109
cannabis and we have multiple products

37
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,500
that we are going to launch in different

38
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,709
states across America and eventually

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,530
internationally yeah awesome and then

40
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,759
mr. Charles Feldman also from the states

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,358
are beginning to troduce yourself

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,030
Thank You Charles Feldman I like to say

43
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:58,259
my cannabis career started about 25

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,799
years ago I was a federal prosecutor in

45
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:07,140
Southern California that wasn't enough

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:10,490
for me so I had to join the DEA and I

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,650
was a task force commander for the DEA

48
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,330
this is you can start sometimes the

49
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,289
audience actually boos me right about

50
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:23,079
this bachelor number three I think you

51
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:26,919
asked to leave the stage I was exactly

52
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:30,909
speaking to the lapel autoloader did

53
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,530
narcotics prosecution also after that by

54
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:35,709
then I'd had my fill of government

55
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,479
started my own law firm we got into

56
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,449
cannabis about ten years ago working

57
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:44,138
with some high net worth clients and now

58
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:46,149
I like to describe a little bit of

59
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:48,189
atonement for me personally being able

60
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,260
to now work on the other side of

61
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:53,500
cannabis being able to use a lot of

62
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:56,530
those skills that we used early on in

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,658
the in the war on drugs environment to

64
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,329
help our clients navigate some really

65
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:05,289
difficult international regulations

66
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:07,569
international landscapes so it's been a

67
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:10,929
very fascinating journey for me both

68
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:14,138
personally and being part of this in

69
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,400
enormous social experience now I work

70
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:20,349
with a international strategy company

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,680
navigating cannabis and hemp all around

72
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:25,000
the world whether it's capital funding

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,010
marrying up those two partners or

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,669
actually just building a good workable

75
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:33,009
strategy that produces profit so tiny

76
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,400
little bit thank you and a good segue to

77
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:38,519
Emmanuel kotzen from humph media all the

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,260
way across the pond coming from Germany

79
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:45,069
yes thanks a lot my name is mano

80
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:47,048
McCutcheon about twenty five five years

81
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:50,918
ago I started making click initiation

82
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:55,750
work for cannabis and after a few years

83
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:59,739
I noticed I have I have to generate some

84
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,199
kind of job and to go on legalizing or

85
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:05,139
we found a company called again to a

86
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:08,010
Soviet and Soviet is the publisher of

87
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:11,439
the biggest hemp magazine in Germany

88
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:14,948
also this is no 20 years ago and in on

89
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:18,629
those 20 years a lot things happened a

90
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:21,800
lot of adventures women

91
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,849
mastered and we are now in a very

92
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,340
interesting position on the German

93
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:28,649
market with a medicinal cannabis

94
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,288
legalization and a lot of possibilities

95
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:34,589
too we we're still hoping one more

96
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:38,339
cannabis coming from Canada but also

97
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:42,899
from all of the planet please send your

98
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:44,579
product to Germany and then we'll bring

99
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:48,439
it back to this side the problem with

100
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:50,279
Vincent jollity out of New York and LA

101
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,098
hey guys

102
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,658
co-founder of show products we start in

103
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:57,538
the industry with extraction equipment

104
00:04:54,658 --> 00:05:00,418
most notable brand we have is rosin tech

105
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:05,430
products we kind of completed the circle

106
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:07,139
to incorporate about 1200 SKUs of

107
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,389
ancillary products and we have

108
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,658
distribution in Czech Republic widel

109
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,218
ahora Mexico in LA we truly are a global

110
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:17,579
company and we service multiple

111
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:20,069
countries every day of the week and our

112
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,870
goal is to kind of unite the cultures of

113
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,639
the world through cannabis and create

114
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,639
some long-lasting brands in the process

115
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:30,089
indefinitely last but not least we'll

116
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:33,449
bring it back home to mr. Darren Gill

117
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:35,098
thank you so my career in cannabis

118
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,900
started when I was 16 and I thought

119
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:39,360
growing weed was as simple as buying a

120
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:42,478
light and a grow tent off of ebay failed

121
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,120
miserably at that spent 11 years in

122
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,028
global manufacturing and supply joined

123
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,209
Deloitte focused on M&amp;A where I helped

124
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:52,620
on both sides of some of the largest

125
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,829
transactions that have taken place in

126
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,259
the kind of a space and then much like

127
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,120
this at a panel met the former CEO of

128
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,560
namaste technologies fell in love with

129
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,840
their story and their model around

130
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,038
partnership and currently their chief

131
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:09,179
strategy officer awesome thank you sir

132
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,129
so we'll kick it right off there's some

133
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,389
interesting topics in the green room

134
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,889
with us someone started talking about

135
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:16,168
politics I don't know who chose that

136
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,848
topic but we definitely will get into

137
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:20,310
something a bit fun and strategic

138
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:22,769
partnerships this is something just on a

139
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,168
personal front is is a huge factor in my

140
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:26,639
mind coming from the media space some

141
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,779
similar to what Hoff has done quite

142
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
successfully on the other side

143
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,989
on I always saw a huge success in

144
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,610
collaborating with other brands

145
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,920
especially like-minded and those that

146
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,110
have similar core values and beliefs but

147
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,509
it's huge in order for everyone to move

148
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,689
everything forward in this industry so I

149
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:45,000
think kind of bouncing off to to Vince

150
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:46,500
to start here the question that we have

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,290
to start off with is what makes

152
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,769
partnering in the industry a win-win for

153
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,660
all parties involved well it's not

154
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,879
always a win-win it's definitely not

155
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,320
always a win-win you got to be careful

156
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,699
who you partner with because there's a

157
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,540
lot of people that aren't interested in

158
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,849
a win-win so I would say aligning your

159
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,710
interests and aligning what both

160
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,030
companies are looking for their core

161
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:12,180
values at the end of the day if you can

162
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,339
align the values of both company of what

163
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,199
they're looking to accomplish and keep

164
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,560
those aligned those are the the best

165
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,389
partnerships that we've had so far when

166
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,689
our interests are aligned that's when we

167
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,849
usually run into some issues with going

168
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:30,269
back to the contract and trying to hash

169
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,500
things out usually when your interests

170
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:33,539
aligned you don't really need to

171
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,699
reference your contract that often you

172
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,500
have a open communication and if there's

173
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,569
any issues that arise you can call up

174
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,889
the other party and try to work it out

175
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,300
because at the end of the day if you

176
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,430
guys are both aligned you're trying to

177
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,620
move forward you're not trying to create

178
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,470
road bumps and hiccups for the other

179
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,310
party so I would say just aligning your

180
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,140
interest would be the the biggest thing

181
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,269
and also the same question for you Tyler

182
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,889
one thing that she's doing right now is

183
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,349
cross licensing which were required to

184
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:04,199
do being that we are not federally legal

185
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,120
in the u.s. so you con questing' into

186
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,139
new states what would you say are the

187
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,930
things you look for in those

188
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,399
partnerships as you expand your brand

189
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:16,019
usually if I'm when I try to build

190
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,060
partnerships I want to make sure that

191
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,819
the company that I'm going to go in

192
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,149
business with is somebody or a group of

193
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:27,000
people that not only bring innovation

194
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:30,509
but they also bring that operation side

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,080
so I need somebody that you have to be

196
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:37,110
able to see the vision with me and help

197
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,129
me move further as well as whatever you

198
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,950
bring to the table

199
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:44,099
you have to be able to want to grow

200
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,960
bigger and see past whatever we're

201
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,759
hiring me for and I think that's the

202
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,460
most important thing because you can't

203
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,009
really plan for the next 10 years but

204
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:57,180
you can plan for how or who you're gonna

205
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:59,819
be with in the next 10 years then from a

206
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,709
little different angle Charles you know

207
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,810
we hear a lot of acronyms as we get into

208
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,480
these partnerships rather [ __ ] use and

209
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:08,159
NDA's and the rest of it but from a

210
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,659
legal standpoint what are some of the

211
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,769
things that you recommend for even the

212
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,669
simplest partnerships

213
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:16,740
I mean partnerships are marriages and

214
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:20,750
sometimes in business they're even more

215
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,190
important more devastating more

216
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,620
rewarding than some of your own personal

217
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,250
relationships so I've always tried to

218
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,289
advise my clients look at a partnership

219
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:34,139
from a very personal perspective look at

220
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:39,209
the context of what you're talking about

221
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:42,689
are you similarly situated or is one

222
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,940
unequal to the other partner what is

223
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,100
your exit strategy I'm always preaching

224
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,440
you know from the very beginning of that

225
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,909
partnership how are you gonna exit when

226
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,800
are you gonna exit what does that look

227
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:55,589
like for you what does that look like

228
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,559
for your partner you know are the two

229
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,930
aligned making sure you've done a real

230
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,049
proper vetting it's a lot of it is just

231
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:06,269
common business tools that you should

232
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,769
bring into this industry no different

233
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,949
than you would in any other typical

234
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,779
partnership then Emmanuel yours is a

235
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,150
little different and I think we've

236
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,939
actually had a partnership before in a

237
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:20,340
past life at one of my companies how is

238
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,780
it internationally to do partnership

239
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,940
especially when some things are lost in

240
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,539
translation and obviously laws as they

241
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,250
pertain to your country versus another

242
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:32,250
country that you might be working with

243
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,700
an entity yet yeah before getting into

244
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,370
contact I try to find out if my partner

245
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,270
if my possible partner is really aware

246
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,919
of the legal situation of this product

247
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,600
this is for me a key question because I

248
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,120
see a lot of companies which have really

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,420
good products that might be they are not

250
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,600
really 100% sure if they are legal or

251
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:57,120
not and I'm ready to overtake a part of

252
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,210
the risk but I would like to know before

253
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,440
which part of the risk so in the

254
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:09,540
international cooperation I try to find

255
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:12,510
partners who have knowledge a heuristic

256
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:17,099
knowledge about their products and also

257
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:19,409
an opinion about it and I ask them also

258
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:27,210
if they have at least one lawyer who

259
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:29,669
confirms it yes you know do to have an

260
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,950
idea about if something is legal or not

261
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:33,569
this is the biggest problem in European

262
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,780
community officially we have the same

263
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:40,010
law the same directives but I have 27

264
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:43,679
different languages also it's 29

265
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:46,019
altogether in 27 countries police

266
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,588
officers registration offices which are

267
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,079
talking total different interpretation

268
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:55,860
cultural interpretation and I cannot

269
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,530
expect an administrative officer working

270
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,889
for the French government to accept a

271
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:04,439
German stamp you know I have to redo it

272
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:07,799
and redo the process of legalizing

273
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,680
my product or my theory so what this is

274
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:13,079
a key question for me about if it's

275
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,659
legal and we say we try to stay on the

276
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:20,850
legal side then the exit strategy is not

277
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:22,769
that risky I would say and then back to

278
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,470
you then one saving the best for last I

279
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,120
promise so as far as partnerships from

280
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,670
province to province maybe even from

281
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,759
province to state any sort of feedback

282
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:34,799
on best practices there well I think one

283
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,480
of the things you know around strategic

284
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,250
partnerships is to make sure you find

285
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,500
somebody that fills a gap and has an

286
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,240
actual value proposition for you so one

287
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,850
of the things we're trying to do at kin

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,339
Mart is position ourselves to help LPS

289
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,769
that aren't necessarily interested in

290
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,339
the processing and sales aspect but

291
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,019
really focused on cultivating

292
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,820
so we actually had a press release even

293
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:57,159
come out today that talks about how

294
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,410
we're now into the BC government and

295
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,000
looking to expand into other channels

296
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:03,338
we're in a unique position where we're

297
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,990
not a cultivator ourselves so everybody

298
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,000
in this room potentially is an industry

299
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,948
partner for us to be working with what

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,659
we do is basically act as the middle

301
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:12,609
agent to be able to help you get

302
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:14,139
processing services get the product

303
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,028
packaged make sure it's compliant take

304
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,100
you through the testing and work to be

305
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,778
able to bid into the government's we

306
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,149
also have an e-commerce platform so we

307
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:24,578
partner with a whole host of LPS and

308
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:27,519
Industry folks to be able to sell direct

309
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:29,409
to consumer medical cannabis and so you

310
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,000
know being able to get into those

311
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,069
channels do the bid lists I think if we

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,899
look at the way any other public sector

313
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,620
has gone you know health care being a

314
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,570
great example

315
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,759
you went from hundreds of suppliers

316
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,829
trying to supply the health authorities

317
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,028
to they've got three or four main

318
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:46,059
distributors that they're working with

319
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:48,370
now so we're able to go to the

320
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,319
provincial governments to any of the

321
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,269
partner companies with a catalog

322
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,769
offering of all of your brands because

323
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,230
we're not interested in competing in

324
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,600
that space great answer and that's

325
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,149
something I'd say as well for us we we

326
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,190
don't just target one segment of the

327
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,690
actual industry and that's beneficial to

328
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,610
your point because everyone in this room

329
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,860
can be a client you know definitely on

330
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,509
the b2b side but still a great factor

331
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,519
and you segue into the next question

332
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:15,100
perfectly and I'll pass this on to Vince

333
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,929
we'll go in order here so for your

334
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,449
company and specific events and your

335
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:22,088
little diverse as well what do you

336
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:26,439
actually bring with your respective

337
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:30,430
products to the table and what is the

338
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:35,079
ideal partner that you would say it's

339
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:37,059
that the ideal partner really it varies

340
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:38,739
in what sector of our business we're

341
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:40,899
talking about but for an ancillary

342
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,440
distribution side which is our strongest

343
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:48,690
division right now I would say a strong

344
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:52,180
brand product so a lot of the consumer

345
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:54,579
goods in the cannabis space can be kind

346
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:56,500
of chintzy and non branded type items in

347
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:58,000
the smoke shop market particularly I'm

348
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,559
talking about like consumption type

349
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,889
devices so what we strive as partners is

350
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,958
we're not looking to

351
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,489
to distribute the the bottom of the

352
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,318
barrel type products we're looking for

353
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:13,129
actual products that have branding

354
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:16,248
marketing budgets a sales team presence

355
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:21,168
at trade shows bringing more to the

356
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:22,278
table than just a product great great

357
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:24,318
response because that's the same thing

358
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,359
we're looking for as well in Tyler

359
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:28,128
likewise but again you know the fact

360
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,629
that your cross licensing and expanding

361
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,459
and already I believe in three states

362
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,379
but looking for future states and future

363
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:35,328
countries what are some of the

364
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:37,159
challenges in finding that ideal partner

365
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:39,318
being that that laws and regulations

366
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:42,100
vary and even demographics and

367
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:44,659
geographical factors play in as well

368
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,058
it's I kind of like that it's different

369
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:49,789
each place because then I can have my

370
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:53,028
products be specific to that city or

371
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:55,248
state wherever I am at and I think the

372
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:57,859
best partner that I can have is someone

373
00:15:55,249 --> 00:16:01,249
who can provide what they say they can

374
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:03,619
provide whenever I need it a lot of the

375
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:05,899
times in cannabis I feel like there's a

376
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,819
lot of hype a lot of people will say

377
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,220
okay I can give you this as this and

378
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:12,349
then when it comes down to it you might

379
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,319
not get the product that you originally

380
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,689
agreed upon or it might not come tasting

381
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:19,128
the same we're looking the same so I the

382
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:21,528
most important is someone with

383
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:23,298
consistency as a brand that's what I'm

384
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:26,058
looking for but I think going

385
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:27,918
state-by-state for me I know that in

386
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:30,438
Arizona they're more focused on a

387
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:32,509
medicinal side with nursing home

388
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:34,308
products for people with a lot of

389
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,470
ailments and stuff like that

390
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:38,838
whereas in California it's one of the

391
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,519
biggest markets but you can get anything

392
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,499
you can go on the recreational side

393
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,470
where it's just more chilling or you can

394
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:48,709
also get a topical for your back pain so

395
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,600
I think having a brand that goes

396
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,938
state-by-state is important for me

397
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,439
because I can have unique products in

398
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:57,428
each state as opposed to just being

399
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:59,480
generic completely across the board

400
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:01,038
perfect and what kind of morph this a

401
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,959
little bit because a lot of people don't

402
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:05,318
know there's 40 countries around the

403
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,519
world that if either legalized or

404
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,888
deregulated a good example is Portugal

405
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,309
that technically be scheduled all drugs

406
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:14,589
and then launched a medical cannabis per

407
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,480
but Michael we've talked about Olivia

408
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,129
the International what are some of the

409
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,130
challenges you have as far as working

410
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,360
over borders and understanding this kind

411
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,860
of segues a little bit of what we were

412
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,149
talking about some of the laws and

413
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,429
regulations that you're having to deal

414
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,790
with from from obviously market to

415
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,789
market

416
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,829
yeah well as I mentioned before please

417
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,929
you have such an advantage in in the

418
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:45,210
u.s. in the North America of one

419
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:50,740
language imagine you you should print

420
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:55,000
your your flyer in 27 languages just in

421
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,220
the european community with particular

422
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,289
officially it's the same regulation but

423
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,880
you will find out different country

424
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:05,859
different translation different

425
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,380
interpretation so of course we working

426
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:11,250
worldwide what we try to concentrate on

427
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,500
the countries which we understand better

428
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:17,079
because some some countries are really

429
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:24,460
difficult to be understood from the from

430
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:28,990
the and but what we can what we see of

431
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,410
course different countries makes it

432
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,289
easier to to registrate and to get in

433
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,870
business in this moment we see germany

434
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,940
is more or less a consumer market we're

435
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:42,849
waiting for the products even it's not

436
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,610
easy to to pass the border but if you

437
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:48,730
pass the border like it was on a panel

438
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:51,699
before i can confirm with a german stamp

439
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,430
within the european community you are a

440
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,069
lot more comfortable to go somewhere

441
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,890
else with with your product than with a

442
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:02,589
stamp let's say from from a small

443
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,330
country with one exception my big

444
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:07,959
recommendation really have a look on

445
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:12,029
Luxembourg they have announced they want

446
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,090
to have the full regulation

447
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:16,799
and I took just eight weeks ago to the

448
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:20,490
Minister of Health

449
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,379
HM Snyder he was just on the trip to

450
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:27,000
Canada to have a look how it's working

451
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:29,880
here and I told him yeah please also ask

452
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,339
those who working with it because they

453
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,310
also already developing one step forward

454
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:38,329
don't make the same mistakes and each

455
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:44,869
country needs also a regulating system

456
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:47,879
which across to the to the local yeah

457
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:50,729
conditions we cannot compare Laxton work

458
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,910
with with German but and this is the big

459
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:57,710
plus we have no borders anymore between

460
00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:01,590
Luxembourg and Germany and France

461
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:05,039
Luxembourg is a great place to go they

462
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:07,049
have a strategic position you can reach

463
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,769
each point of the European community

464
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:13,049
within 24 hour with you your parcel so

465
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:15,660
when they regulate the right way you

466
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:18,180
have a really wonderful hub in the

467
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,970
European community in the center of it

468
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,610
his usage also to supply Germany or

469
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,900
France yeah and I think that's one thing

470
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:26,369
he's talking on for those who didn't get

471
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,590
the memo that Luxembourg did allowance

472
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:31,619
announced legalization of adult use to

473
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:33,149
come into effect hopefully by 2022 but

474
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:34,559
the fact that Canada has been quite an

475
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,269
influence right and some of the things

476
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,149
happening globally being a Commonwealth

477
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:41,460
country France has announced a medical

478
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,019
beta program Ireland finally has come

479
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,720
around of course to England announced as

480
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,009
well so Charles and some of some of the

481
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,140
legal things that come into play because

482
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:50,819
all of us have talked about dabbling in

483
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,210
the international some of us already do

484
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:56,399
of course what again are the challenges

485
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,890
that you see even logistical e with

486
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,820
doing business even just across the pond

487
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:06,150
over to a place like Europe that's a

488
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:08,220
great question I think most of what my

489
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,280
strategy company that I'm a part of we

490
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,329
talk with clients the most about is just

491
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,369
context

492
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:18,490
the international community is so

493
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:21,309
exciting there's so much sex appeal to

494
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,680
it being an international brand but

495
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:26,019
unless you truly can grasp the context I

496
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,810
mean just listening to some of these key

497
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:31,329
experts talk about practicing on an

498
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:34,029
international scale it gets really

499
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:35,949
complicated you know how complicated is

500
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:38,049
just in your own jurisdiction where you

501
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,640
operate right now whether that's a local

502
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:44,470
city or Providence or a state when you

503
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,270
move outside and you're crossing

504
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,370
international borders and you're dealing

505
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,160
with international drug control treaties

506
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:53,769
and UN and who some of the speakers

507
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:57,910
talked about it earlier it truly gets

508
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:59,410
complicated and as my you know fellow

509
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,440
speaker here is talking about if you're

510
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,470
a company that is really focused on

511
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,090
compliance and being a hundred percent

512
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,339
compliant in whatever whatever area

513
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:13,149
you're operating in truly grasping that

514
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:15,399
context is vitally important as you

515
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,009
continue to grow and your success grows

516
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,840
that level of compliance becomes even

517
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:22,779
more important you've seen a lot of

518
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,519
great companies make considerable

519
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,950
revenue they're there on this upswing

520
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:31,359
and then have some real compliance

521
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:33,460
hidden skeleton you know in their

522
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,679
background that that really makes that

523
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,160
difficult to continue that level of

524
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,289
revenue growth so another question and

525
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,880
we obviously know some obvious for the

526
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:45,849
Canadian market I would probably say

527
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,080
lift for for the US it's definitely MJ

528
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:53,799
biz I think even for Emanuel maybe

529
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:55,210
spannabis or Mary Jane or Kenna fest but

530
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,710
what are some of the other places for

531
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,569
individuals in the crowd that are

532
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,549
looking to establish strategic

533
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:02,169
partnerships or grow strategic

534
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,809
partnerships what are some of the places

535
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,450
that you would recommend to search out

536
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:09,039
these contacts in these companies short

537
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,250
of a Google search is there any sort of

538
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,839
Secrets that you might have and you know

539
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,980
what could those be that have really

540
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,779
helped you out again we'll start with

541
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,210
you there and if that's okay yeah no I

542
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:20,589
think the biggest place assault me out

543
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,180
is looking through your own personal

544
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:23,429
Network

545
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,799
I think the degrees of separation within

546
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,630
this industry are fairly small and you

547
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,119
usually know a guy who knows a guy very

548
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,800
similar to back in the day so you know

549
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:33,539
it reach out to the folks around you

550
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,829
there's a lot of companies that have

551
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,899
been Trailblazers and being a

552
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:38,369
trailblazer is great but the risk you

553
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,290
take getting out in front of the pack is

554
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:42,299
getting burned so learn from others

555
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,589
mistakes you know roll that into what

556
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:46,409
you're doing and develop a sound

557
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:48,839
strategy and approach that it you know

558
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:50,670
really requires focus and picking the

559
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,069
verticals that you want to take on and

560
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:56,220
really own and looking for the right

561
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:57,419
relationships around you to be able to

562
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,490
help fill in the rest of the gaps

563
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,350
because as we've seen time and time

564
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,170
again no one company can do everything

565
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:05,699
well very well put and we'll continue on

566
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:12,470
down the line with events a little bit

567
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:17,759
of your feedback as well I think he said

568
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:20,089
the words out of my mouth the only thing

569
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,160
I would add is know your strengths like

570
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:25,379
really you have to be honest with

571
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,180
yourself what am I good at and what am I

572
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,120
not good at and you have to find someone

573
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:37,289
who's good at what you are not good at

574
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:39,449
it's not gonna work after that I guess I

575
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:41,639
would I would continue to add the

576
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,380
vetting process I just think it is so

577
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,450
important especially in a lot of the

578
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,250
work that I've done either legally for

579
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,799
clients or helping clients build

580
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:52,680
strategy is truly vetting the

581
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,139
information that you get it's a great

582
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,720
industry it's got great people in it

583
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,790
but like any other industry there are a

584
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,410
lot of snake oil salesmen there are a

585
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,920
lot of people who are just looking for

586
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:08,310
the quick dollar or whatever that may be

587
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,950
so I constantly again go back to just

588
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:13,919
common business practices like it would

589
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:16,230
be in any other industry that that

590
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,930
information know who you're getting

591
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:22,110
involved with know what that background

592
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,060
is if it's coming from the legacy

593
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:26,899
community know what that means

594
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:30,168
I mean truly know what is coming forward

595
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:36,139
as you as you build out your

596
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:38,389
your business wants to add more yet puts

597
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:41,148
time into it into making that connection

598
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:44,058
we investing from the first day of of

599
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:46,189
our existence time into international

600
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:49,759
networking because we know exactly this

601
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:54,230
is a global market and then first ten

602
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,788
years we need to find out who is really

603
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,730
active in Europe in our neighbor

604
00:25:55,788 --> 00:26:00,950
countries and you know all we on a level

605
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:04,548
to invest a lot of time running around

606
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:07,340
the planet from shore to show I can by

607
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:10,249
the way recommend really I CPC you

608
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:12,738
events because it's b2b and I'm very

609
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:15,108
happy about a Berlin event because the

610
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:17,629
whole planet is coming to Berlin and it

611
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:20,058
saves my travel costs thanks for this

612
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:23,868
and which is the real interest very good

613
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:27,200
chef yes and but I cannot recommend one

614
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:29,480
special show or a secret show there are

615
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,929
debt many popping up we have at least

616
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,378
fifty in Europe going on I was four

617
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:38,960
months ago in Ukraine uh and I was super

618
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:41,599
surprised by the high quality of of the

619
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,298
convention there but of course you

620
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:47,449
cannot predict that and the market in

621
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:50,089
you Crona is very far away please don't

622
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,548
don't think next next day you can make

623
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:54,648
return on investment but super

624
00:26:52,548 --> 00:26:56,778
interesting countries super interesting

625
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:59,658
possibilities but you have to invest

626
00:26:56,778 --> 00:27:03,019
time and to develop trust to our content

627
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:05,179
I just want to add that like the

628
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:06,919
networking at the events I think I know

629
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,609
you said other than the events but the

630
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,070
networking at the events is really key

631
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:17,480
especially like for three years I

632
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:19,489
basically from 2015 to 2018 I didn't

633
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,409
have a home I went from trade show to

634
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:23,419
trade show I didn't stay in one place

635
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:25,159
for more than six states I have it

636
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,080
booked at my calendar I didn't stay in

637
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,850
one place for more than six days over

638
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,759
that course of three years I built a

639
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:34,548
worldwide network that I leaned on every

640
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,429
day so so that network that I continue

641
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:39,259
to build and be at the astrayed shows is

642
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,359
really my biggest asset in this industry

643
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,278
because like he said like we really are

644
00:27:41,358 --> 00:27:43,819
like a degree of separation from someone

645
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,769
and if

646
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:47,450
you ask around about someone someone

647
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:49,129
else knows whether they're good they're

648
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,590
bad what their strengths are what their

649
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,240
weaknesses are so I would just say that

650
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:54,799
people out through the industry it's

651
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,720
still a small industry it's still an

652
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,329
intimate industry it's still not that

653
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,600
many of us at the top or players in the

654
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:04,429
game so just lean on your fellow network

655
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,649
and and that's what would be my advice

656
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,150
and I just want to add one thing around

657
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,769
the whole vetting but I think it's

658
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,480
really important you know there's a lot

659
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:14,389
of advisers and everybody's an expert in

660
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,089
this industry vet your advisers as well

661
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,580
it makes them an adviser exactly it just

662
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:21,439
became a kind of advisor yesterday

663
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:23,149
exactly you know I think one of the

664
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,789
things that I've seen time and time

665
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,220
again personally and other companies as

666
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,200
well is all too often the way you ask

667
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,089
the question will change the answer you

668
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,500
get so also make sure what you're trying

669
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,240
to achieve and that you're asking those

670
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,710
questions the right way because it'll

671
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,349
often you know you can talk to five

672
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,029
people and get five different answers

673
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,199
that's spot-on and I think exactly what

674
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,059
Vince what you're talking about yeah

675
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,259
those of us have been on this circuit

676
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,599
and the same thing I've been on for five

677
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:50,029
year I did 30 shows my division I had

678
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,500
268 shows but 30 of them I worked for

679
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,609
the exact same reason you speak because

680
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,410
you have to get out there you have to

681
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:56,539
build your network in your network has a

682
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,430
net worth right that's exactly what

683
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:00,529
you're saying so if you are a company or

684
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,180
an entity that has the vests ters that

685
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:03,500
want to get into this industry look for

686
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,410
someone who does have that network

687
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,240
because it is such an advantage an

688
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,590
exponential advantage to move forward

689
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,049
and I think a few things we talked about

690
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:13,069
in the green room Tyler mentioned it's

691
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,200
interesting because I compared a

692
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:17,210
partnership to a marriage just just like

693
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,100
what was said in the green room as well

694
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,500
but Tyler said you know I'm also looking

695
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:22,730
for what I don't want in a partner and

696
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,349
it isn't any different than your

697
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,509
personal life you know I explained just

698
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:28,609
my little second cousins they're now 23

699
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:30,140
but I said you know you don't go through

700
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:32,059
life knowing exactly what you do want

701
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,130
you realize what you don't want and it's

702
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,399
applicable in so many situations in this

703
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:40,280
one very much just as much so definitely

704
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,610
all excellent feedback kind of say going

705
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:45,980
into how does a business in in this is

706
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,839
definitely a little while because it's

707
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,610
applicable different to individuals on

708
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,189
this board because some of us are

709
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:53,298
focused on widgets on tangible goods in

710
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,340
others

711
00:29:53,298 --> 00:29:58,970
are not intangibles right services

712
00:29:55,339 --> 00:30:02,178
versus goods but a good question is you

713
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,929
know how does a business generate net

714
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:08,538
profits and actual valuations in the

715
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,429
global space and and I think we'll again

716
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:13,638
we'll start the opposite end with a

717
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:16,389
manual first sorry but I did not

718
00:30:13,638 --> 00:30:18,788
understand really a question so yeah so

719
00:30:16,388 --> 00:30:21,349
you obviously so you offer a service

720
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:25,999
let's say more so than a tangible

721
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:29,329
product so where do you actually pull a

722
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:32,269
net profit or a positive out of that

723
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:35,058
from a partnership yeah what what we

724
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:38,149
really can office a net profit is of

725
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:41,898
course our possibility to advertise and

726
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:43,849
to marketing within our network so each

727
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:47,028
partner can really profit out of this

728
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:52,398
and it's an easy thing to drop this in

729
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:54,589
into a partnership and this is like yeah

730
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:58,398
we can we can repeat this and we hope

731
00:30:54,589 --> 00:31:02,178
that our partners see the effect are

732
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:05,748
growing just faster this is this is a

733
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:09,769
big advantage and through this through

734
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:16,129
this possibilities of also being very

735
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:20,329
open with with this kind of services we

736
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:23,599
generated a lot of of cooperation might

737
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:26,178
be just small cooperation but spreading

738
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:29,388
the information about your product about

739
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:33,739
each product it it makes a nice

740
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:37,278
situation a nice mood for maybe making

741
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:40,909
more together very simple thing it don't

742
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:43,999
cost a lot from our side and makes open

743
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:45,350
doors for sure definitely in Charles I

744
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:47,089
know it's may be a slight variance on

745
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:49,099
this question for you but maybe even as

746
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:51,738
a third party as mean that individual

747
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:53,658
from a counselor legal side what things

748
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:55,730
do you you kind of point out as far as

749
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:57,490
where it's rewarding for both parties in

750
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:02,740
partnerships

751
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:05,470
I think it's for that question with a

752
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,058
lot of times we're value-add because

753
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:11,319
we're telling you what you don't want to

754
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:14,049
hear having been from the complete other

755
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:17,109
side of this industry having fully

756
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:19,389
embraced this industry in really looking

757
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:22,178
for ways that we're not just making

758
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,100
money but we're actually helping you

759
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:27,100
accomplish what it is you are out to

760
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:30,579
accomplish it's not always easy to do

761
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:33,459
and it's there are a lot of yes people

762
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:35,349
out there we're just going to tell you

763
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,759
whatever you want to hear that's great

764
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:38,829
we're gonna make millions of dollars

765
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:41,619
we're going to change the world we're

766
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:43,659
going to cure cancer and not all of us

767
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:46,089
are gonna get to do that and really

768
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,730
being able to have professional services

769
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:51,609
around you that are true that are honest

770
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,230
authentic and are going to tell you

771
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:55,779
things that you don't want to hear I've

772
00:32:53,230 --> 00:33:00,279
found has been real value to our clients

773
00:32:55,779 --> 00:33:05,379
have saved them lots of money time pain

774
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:08,170
energy along the way great and then

775
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,200
Tyler obviously from a cross-licensing

776
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:17,050
or brand partnership the benefits there

777
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:19,360
I I feel like my role on the brand side

778
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:23,079
is to help educate as much as possible

779
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:26,829
and D stigmatize I think that's if

780
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:29,319
anything a brand can do is help the

781
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:32,169
cannabis movement move forward in a

782
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:35,740
positive light so that's my biggest

783
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:38,289
mission in anything cannabis is to make

784
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,289
sure that I'm teaching people how great

785
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:43,509
this plan is but I'm also getting rid of

786
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:46,379
all of the negative that we were

787
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:46,379
originally taught

788
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:54,369
great I think for for us on the

789
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:57,339
ancillary distribution side our biggest

790
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:59,289
value at is that we we have a sales team

791
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:02,649
with current relationships with over

792
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:05,289
5,000 retail shops across the globe so

793
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:08,409
when we do identify a potential product

794
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:10,989
that we think fits into our catalog we

795
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:13,510
can bring that to to the doors of many

796
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:16,059
shops very quickly but the other thing

797
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,500
and kind of what he touched on is that

798
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:19,029
we're very upfront if your product

799
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,219
doesn't work we're gonna tell you this

800
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,380
is wrong the boxing's wrong this doesn't

801
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:25,629
work and like not in a negative way but

802
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,000
we we offer like a brand acceleration

803
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:31,690
program also so we'll help you if we

804
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,210
think there's value there to to reformat

805
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,309
your packaging or readjust your margins

806
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,570
and whatever is wrong with the product

807
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:40,119
that we don't think is gonna work we'll

808
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,519
adjust it so kind of giving you the

809
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:50,139
truth on whether your product is gonna

810
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:52,630
make it in market or not perfect so you

811
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,710
know I think two years ago the way I

812
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,909
would have answered this question is a

813
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,590
lot different than today when you had

814
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,180
easy access to capital and you could

815
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,059
sneeze the word cannabis and raise five

816
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,679
million bucks in a room the fact is in

817
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,880
today's market where you know there's a

818
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,259
lot of headwinds and a lot more

819
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,789
challenges at getting access to capital

820
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,520
there's really three things that I think

821
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:12,369
about and it goes back to focus leverage

822
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,019
and choices and focus to me is pick

823
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:15,789
where you want to fit in the value chain

824
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:18,940
what you really really want to

825
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:20,889
specialize on and execute that business

826
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,240
plan have a strategy you know I think

827
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:23,619
like we've heard other panelists talk

828
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,149
about how are you gonna get out of this

829
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:26,589
business what are you going in why are

830
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,150
you doing this and really have those

831
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,460
things defined and written down and they

832
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,740
may change over time but making sure you

833
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,389
stay true to your business plan leverage

834
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:36,639
is once you've invested in something

835
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:38,559
make sure that you find new ways of

836
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,659
leveraging that investment so for us at

837
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,549
Tan Mart we were originally a

838
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:44,170
direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform

839
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,940
for medical well hey great we've got

840
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:48,039
this facility I've got a license that

841
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,349
can do processing and sales why am I not

842
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:52,449
selling into rec how can I use this as

843
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:55,239
an upsell to other LPS about you add

844
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:57,909
service and the other one is choices you

845
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:59,409
know sometimes it's a very exciting

846
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:00,190
industry you're gonna get opportunities

847
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:01,690
coming out you left

848
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,818
right and center but picking and

849
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:06,579
choosing which ones you're gonna take

850
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:08,289
and ultimately being able to say no and

851
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,329
walk away from opportunities to stay

852
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:12,338
true to your business plan is hugely

853
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:14,260
important because you may miss an

854
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:16,328
opportunity here but you may run out of

855
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,180
capital bandwidth or just energy to

856
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:20,800
execute on the other parts that work a

857
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,539
fundamental part of your business when

858
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,119
you start it off so I think you've got

859
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:26,980
to really stay true to a strategy once

860
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,690
you've laid it out and and this is you

861
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,490
know not to sound like a strategy guy

862
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,240
but when you plan something out for 2 to

863
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,459
3 years

864
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:37,449
there's a reason you're going down that

865
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:39,039
road and shifting every week or you know

866
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:40,929
two months because something new and

867
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,380
hots come up isn't the right way to

868
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:45,848
execute on a business that's spot-on and

869
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,230
actually have a good example of what

870
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:49,240
you're talking about you know we're

871
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,980
again very big on strategic partnerships

872
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,838
at Bhavana and we found that we're

873
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,219
growing out of one partnership but we

874
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,650
found someone that takes that place

875
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:58,299
almost with the 10 acts as far as what

876
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,519
the attribute from both sides it's it's

877
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,990
not one-sided but it's a very good point

878
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:04,389
don't feel like you're constantly locked

879
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:06,039
in and what a lot of us do because the

880
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,779
industry is still small enough all of us

881
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,579
know this I mean the fact that that

882
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,680
there's relationships up here from

883
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:14,200
different countries is a good example of

884
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,969
it but don't lock yourself in a lot of

885
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,460
these are gentleman agreements a lot of

886
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:20,889
them are handshakes hopefully not loaded

887
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,710
handshakes you might establish an NDA or

888
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:25,239
again an MoU to work together but

889
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,220
leaving yourself an open end or some

890
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:28,929
sort of clause because all of a sudden

891
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:31,239
someone's business strategy changes

892
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:33,039
yourself included and you need to be

893
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,409
able to adapt and move the ship

894
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,940
accordingly right no it's been a huge

895
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:37,920
part of what we've been trying to do

896
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,000
with our direct-to-consumer

897
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,858
relationships you know we made a choice

898
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,780
we launched out and we had our own

899
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:45,429
branded product we realized if we're

900
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,019
truly trying to be an industry partner

901
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,519
and partner with LPS I can't have a

902
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:50,259
competing product when I'm trying to

903
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,380
sell yours we made a conscious decision

904
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,030
to stop that work so we can focus on the

905
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,019
relationship with the LPS because that's

906
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:59,530
what was important to our business

907
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:00,849
strategy spot-on so this gets the next

908
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,589
question a little more detail and then

909
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:04,480
I'll give an example you know for us

910
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:06,338
above it I'm very fortunate that we've

911
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,780
got a phenomenon R&amp;D team so one of the

912
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:09,519
things that we do when we partner

913
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,369
because everyone we consider partners

914
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,780
not customers for success but we

915
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:16,570
actually offer a service where

916
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,580
we do leak down tests on LPS packaging

917
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,170
right so we want to make sure to

918
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:22,150
maintain the quality and consistency of

919
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,519
the product maintain that moisture but

920
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,619
obviously we all know air and and light

921
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,139
is the other two things that further an

922
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:30,730
expedite the degradation of the plant so

923
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:33,099
that's a specific attribute that we

924
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:35,440
bring to a partnership is there one

925
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:37,389
specific attribute that you kind of have

926
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,190
as that ace up your sleeve that you find

927
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:41,079
pulling out and putting on the table

928
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:44,260
more often than not and we can go back

929
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:46,659
down the line no definitely I think for

930
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:50,260
for us the the biggest ace up our sleeve

931
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:52,269
is that direct to consumer access and

932
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,950
the fact that we take care of customer

933
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:55,840
service technology development and

934
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:57,369
product distribution those are the three

935
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,130
areas that we want to play and that's

936
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:01,659
where our focus is so from from that

937
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,369
portion that's that's the strongest

938
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:07,539
value add that we bring to our partners

939
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:10,630
I would say also our distribution

940
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:13,329
network of direct-to-consumer and also

941
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,849
the fact that our team has our finger on

942
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:18,250
the pulse our team is extremely

943
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:20,139
knowledgeable depending on which sector

944
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,179
of our team but we have a lot of

945
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:24,400
knowledge and our finger on the pulse in

946
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:26,469
the industry so knowledge finger on the

947
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,349
pulse and our distribution network we

948
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:30,549
our strong suits

949
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,889
produces our I feel like our biggest

950
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:35,590
strength right now is marketing and

951
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:37,900
making sure there is a positive brand

952
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,510
association with our brand and just

953
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:44,740
getting the name out getting everywhere

954
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:46,870
and making sure that people will see

955
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:48,849
doose's and immediately know that they

956
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:50,319
can trust us and that's something that

957
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:55,719
we've been trying to push for a while

958
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:58,450
and I also feel like there are certain

959
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:00,639
products that I know I need to find the

960
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:02,079
best version of this because there's the

961
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,969
market is flooded with the greatest

962
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,529
vapes but I need to know which vape is

963
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,329
the best vape and I feel like that's

964
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,790
something that we've really tried to

965
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:12,940
figure out is what are the best products

966
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:15,190
for us to get involved in and how to get

967
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,409
those products as many places as

968
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:20,650
possible without like over saturating

969
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:24,460
the market I have no idea what the

970
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:27,340
question is was our our strengths so in

971
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,960
my game Jason your ace up the sleeve

972
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,430
far as for your specific business that

973
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,000
you bring to the table and negotiating

974
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:36,639
strategic products I would say for us

975
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,210
said at GPS that global it would be

976
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,859
authenticity so whatever we're going to

977
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,139
talk about whatever we're gonna give you

978
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,180
is gonna be authentic we're not gonna

979
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:48,219
sell you something we can't deliver

980
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:50,710
we're not gonna promise something that

981
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:54,189
is unreachable we're not gonna build a

982
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,990
strategy that is that is ridiculous

983
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,510
it's truly gonna come from a very

984
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:02,019
grounded place of authenticity

985
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:04,150
I've seen so many consultants out there

986
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:06,130
who truly come from the last failed

987
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:09,340
three businesses and so now they're a

988
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,650
consultant so I agree I don't know who

989
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,079
said that down they're like eh bet your

990
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,970
professional services absolutely

991
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,250
whether it's your lawyer your accountant

992
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:19,929
your consultant make sure you know where

993
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,579
they're coming from and where this

994
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:26,710
advice that is you know supposedly so

995
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:31,000
expensive where where that's coming from

996
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:35,380
and why yeah it's difficult to answer

997
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,469
because in order we have know 20 years

998
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:43,480
of history was with this business and

999
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:46,809
it's not easy to when we started it was

1000
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,650
easier to exact define we we want to

1001
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:53,889
spread the information and we overtook

1002
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:55,930
some some kind of leadership in this

1003
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:59,859
information building information

1004
00:41:55,929 --> 00:42:01,719
spreading in Germany and as the S

1005
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:06,039
approached as the market became bigger

1006
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:10,089
the challenges became bigger so our like

1007
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:12,130
main topic is still to keep keep ahead

1008
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:16,050
with the information because we build up

1009
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:21,119
a huge database of information about

1010
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:26,410
regulations about products exactly

1011
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:30,029
persons players organizations and et

1012
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:33,039
cetera a huge data collection in fact

1013
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,900
and we trying really to to update it

1014
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,769
daily

1015
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:44,210
and to gather more information and a

1016
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:47,219
totally no go for us is when our partner

1017
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:50,730
cannot tell me our a story about his

1018
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:53,219
product when is a soul less product I

1019
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:57,780
cannot sell it I cannot promote it I

1020
00:42:53,219 --> 00:43:00,419
need a story yes and this is a no-go if

1021
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:04,680
you just have a price list that's that's

1022
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:07,200
two less for for me we need some real

1023
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:09,089
story behind it yeah I agree I think the

1024
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,949
moral of the story is definitely do your

1025
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,390
homework and we don't mean to pick on

1026
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:15,119
consultants but all of us have come

1027
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,739
across them I had one in LA she is an

1028
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,809
industry expert looked at her LinkedIn

1029
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:22,559
she's a Pilates instructor last year I

1030
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:25,019
don't think we mean to pick on ya have

1031
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,340
knowledge but yeah it's consulting and

1032
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,230
you're out there pretending to be a

1033
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,180
consultant like I'll pick on you like

1034
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,010
don't don't be there don't be giving

1035
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:33,839
people false information like you will

1036
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,830
call you out at one point like come

1037
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,300
across someone that knows their

1038
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:41,219
information and pretend to be a

1039
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,300
consultant and cool well I think some of

1040
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,919
them they they pull from their

1041
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,880
experience this one in specific said

1042
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,950
well you know I've been consuming

1043
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,420
cannabis in size 14 I said well I've

1044
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:51,000
been using a restroom since I was born

1045
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,430
and I'm not a urologist you know I just

1046
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,139
so you guys know I was in my college

1047
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:56,819
town for 10 years I did not get a doctor

1048
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:58,319
but that's exactly just do your homework

1049
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,850
is what we're getting out I think that's

1050
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,960
kind of the overarching message here is

1051
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:02,069
do your homework when you come into a

1052
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,780
partnership

1053
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,180
this isn't tinder you don't just swipe

1054
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,100
right you're not just DTF you're not

1055
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:09,899
just down to have fun this is something

1056
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:11,039
that's so Polly hopefully somewhat of a

1057
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,809
long-term we gotta get a little

1058
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,269
lightheaded a day you guys if you

1059
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:16,769
haven't smoked you should so it's one of

1060
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:18,090
those things where you you just have to

1061
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:20,429
take it serious though think of it more

1062
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,630
of match calm or farmers calm whatever

1063
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:23,429
you want to actually do a little

1064
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,720
homework get a little background get to

1065
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:26,429
know um it doesn't mean you have to be

1066
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,189
married with them forever this is the

1067
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:31,889
2000s but still at least dude ill do

1068

diligence and and if not vince will call

1069

1070
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,560
so let's segue into some Q&amp;A we'll keep

1071
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:39,480
it a little light we definitely have a

1072
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,099
few minutes I think for questions and

1073
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,849
Mike's gonna be coming around let's hear

1074

Bueller Bueller

1077
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,389
[Music]

1078
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,119
all right all the way well you have to

1079
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,700
sit so far away man it's called exercise

1080
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,460
a long day I wore comfy shoes that's the

1081
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:06,989
important thing

1082
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,010
question for the panel wondering what

1083
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:10,019
you guys see is some of the most

1084
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,310
strategic and important strategic

1085
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:12,929
partnerships that you can have right now

1086
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:14,699
in the industry and of course this could

1087
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:16,199
go company by company so please it could

1088
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,480
be an image or it could be an

1089
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,489
overarching for us all starting as

1090
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,650
packages packaging the packaging

1091
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:26,759
division companies like a pack and two

1092
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:28,230
packed push bottles Green Lane some of

1093
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,370
the biggest players there are obvious

1094
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,769
partners to us because it's like

1095
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:33,239
chocolate and peanut butter right so it

1096
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:36,989
just makes sense you know that's where

1097
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:39,569
our product typically goes so ya know

1098
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:41,189
for us it's focusing on value add

1099
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,630
services so you know we've got a

1100
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,159
relationship with Shopify we've got a

1101
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,099
partnership with my friends at Bovada

1102
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,449
we work on accessories so we work with

1103
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:50,460
Green Lanes so you know we've got a

1104
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:53,609
strong ecommerce platform we've got

1105
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,960
relationships with a whole host of LPS I

1106
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,390
think we've got the widest product

1107
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,949
selection for medical cannabis available

1108
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:02,339
anywhere right now on our website from

1109
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:04,199
LP and SKU count and we're continuing to

1110
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:09,210
grow it and you know sign new partners

1111
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:11,699
up every week for us it's strong

1112
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,409
products strong brands that we can

1113
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:15,079
distribute those are what we're looking

1114
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:20,279
for and then on the extraction equipment

1115
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:23,099
quality processors for us it's making

1116
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,900
sure that its quality flour or whatever

1117
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,400
we're getting we need that's like the

1118
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,780
most important thing to me something

1119
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,329
that I will smoke something that I'll

1120
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:33,240
give someone else to smoke but I need to

1121
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:35,519
be able to trust the grower and I think

1122
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,439
that's the most important relationship I

1123
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,440
have as a brand is to be able to have

1124
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,769
flour and say yes I believe in this here

1125
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,769
try this

1126
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:53,649
please we love the growers I would say a

1127
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:56,070
an actual strategy a roadmap to profits

1128
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:58,210
so if you don't know from where you are

1129
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,190
to where you're trying to go and you

1130
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:04,150
don't have a roadmap of how you're gonna

1131
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:05,650
create actual net revenues then you got

1132
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,809
to rethink your business plan

1133
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:13,420
that'd be the simplest way I can answer

1134
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:17,230
that yeah it's not easy to add something

1135
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:19,059
on it I mean strong brands the quality

1136
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:24,869
of the grass is really very very

1137
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:29,739
important for the consumers yes and

1138
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:33,670
might be don't give up the next day take

1139
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:36,250
take your time all to perform for some

1140
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:40,570
users still a lot of market and if the

1141
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:44,679
first plan isn't a success there's still

1142
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:46,150
time for another one I think we had one

1143
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:48,309
more Oh is there one more oh I didn't

1144
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,300
see sorry the practice in your baseball

1145
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:51,130

1146
00:47:49,300 --> 00:48:00,760
underhand base will switch myself barren

1147
00:47:51,130 --> 00:48:04,869
