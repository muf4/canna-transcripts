00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,180
Canada we're vertically integrated our

54
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,878
main foray was into the medical cannabis

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,159
Market we still have a clinic that is

56
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,199
operating to this day under the goodbye

opioids hello cannabis campaign with

58
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,459
over 7 000 patients we advise numerous

59
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,098
countries internationally as well as

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,800
help with legislation as well as

61
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:55,560
marketing initiatives and how to be able

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,800
to regulate educating doctors and

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,620
educating doctors Pharmacists and

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,719
producers and patients alike we were

65
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,420
fortunate enough to be able to have a

66
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:09,060
brand and a presence to be able to open

67
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,699
up the very first legal cannabis store

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,378
in a G20 nation that was federally legal

69
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,079
that was under the brand of hello

70
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,598
cannabis we opened I believe that was

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
three and a half years ago we since

72
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,000
expanded of course but I I do truly

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,220
believe that the medical aspect is is

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,439
near and dear to my heart and the

75
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,479
marketing campaigns and initiatives and

76
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,158
rules and regulations vary dramatically

77
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,959
between the two particularly

78
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,060
internationally so I'm happy to be able

79
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,580
to share some advice and guidance on

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,739
what worked and what definitely did not

81
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,620
work and I urge you not to do the things

82
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,539
that definitely didn't work they have

83
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,099

00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:22,740
company

170
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,900
so this kind of shows exactly how much

171
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,000
an impact

172
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,560
um Wiz Khalifa has had in the Cannabis

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,500
industry under kke

174
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,000
nobody's even heard of it

175
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,800
uh we had some very interesting

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,720
situations in Canada where immediately

177
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,300
we wanted to have celebrity endorsements

178
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,800
for all of these products

179
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,020
um I'm sure there there has to be an

180
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
example in some other country but um so

181
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,680
forgive me if I'm being overly

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,419
presumptuous here but I don't know of a

183
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,579
single celebrity that endorses a

184
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,918
pharmaceutical prescription product you

185
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,139
know like I don't see Bill Murray like

186
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:58,318
like saying like I like Viagra you

187
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:01,139
should take it too you know it just

188
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,280
doesn't happen and unfortunately a lot

189
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,538
of these companies in Canada were

190
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,918
throwing millions of dollars at

191
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:07,560
Celebrities thinking that they could

192
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,478
endorse these products at that time it

193
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,978
was only medical it was not recreational

194
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,079
so you had celebrities that were

195
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:14,758
endorsing a product that's only

196
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,038
available via prescription which is

197
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,720
essentially never happened before

198
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,079
and you can see right now how big an

199
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,580
impact is it was and I won't throw them

200
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,019
under the bus he's a friend of mine but

201
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,818
the the gentleman that was running the

202
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,740
company that did that wasted a cool like

203
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,300
2.5 million dollars on that to have

204
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,580
literally zero impact for an

205
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,959
international rap artist that I don't

206
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,399
know he's probably got like 100 million

207
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,158
followers or something stupid like that

208
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,559
I don't know I'm not an influencer

209
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,718
um and what we did notice is when things

210
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,059
transitioned to recreational a lot of

211
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,980
those marketing rules transitioned from

212
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,539
both medical over to recreational as

213
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,740
well and this is what I found

214
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,240
fascinating because when you start

215
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,560
looking at recreational things you

216
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,060
really you should be able to have

217
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,278
celebrity endorsements you should be

218
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:59,879
able to have people that say like I

219
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:02,519
prefer I prefer Heineken over this right

220
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,278
and that happens very commonly in in

221
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,659
Canada it did not right

222
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,019
um anybody here's another fun one

223
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:12,899
anybody know the company lbs

224
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:15,899
I do all right so we have two two people

225
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,539
that's Snoop Dogg lbs is Snoop Dogg

226
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,399
Leafs by Snoop

227
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,039
so like how strong is your marketing

228
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,980
campaign when the whole name and entity

229
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,199
behind it is stripped right down to an

230
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,300
acronym there's no value there

231
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,440
so it's it's rather interesting when you

232
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:33,359
start looking at these rules and

233
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,680
regulations I highly recommend steering

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
away from

235
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,679
um endorsements with respect to

236
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,420
celebrities

237
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,099
um they like getting paid I've not seen

238
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,500
a single one of these work that's

239
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,800
probably the biggest mistake that I've

240
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,899
seen major companies make if you uh

241
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,759
heard me allude earlier I said there are

242
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,320
serious repercussions these

243
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,240
repercussions forward to the tune of

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,160
over 10 million dollars and in my

245
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,919
opinion was critical to bankrupt this

246
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,019
company thanks just to compliment that

247
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,939
that comments

248
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,039
um I think that it's very interesting

249
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,260
the difference between uh celebrities

250
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,539
and communities even though they both

251
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:12,299
absolutely massive Traction in social

252
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:15,179
media especially is not the same and the

253
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:17,639
quality of the follower or subscriber is

254
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,979
not going to be the same and the the uh

255
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,919
their disposition to or their

256
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,200
availability for engaging with whatever

257
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,139
content is coming from there it's gonna

258
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,019
switch and transition very strongly even

259
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,299
if it's the same follower from Snoop

260
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,940
Dogg that's watching this content in his

261
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,859
platform or if it's in a different

262
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,779
platform that is an actual cannabis

263
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,240
community and I think this is very

264
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,500
important to Define and I think we're

265
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,820
going to come back to social media for

266
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,100
sure Luna what are the biggest

267
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,540
challenges you face in terms of the work

268
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,459
you're doing well that's a part of it

269
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,980
right because in California we sell cool

270
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,299
and how is cool sold in the states and

271
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,060
in most of the world it's on social

272
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,379
media and we've had major issues with

273
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,078
the terms and conditions not being

274
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,179
favorable on Instagram not being able to

275
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,819
use hashtags not being able to consume

276
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,799
on camera not being able to getting

277
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,240
Shadow banned or blocked from being

278
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,578
searchable

279
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,100
um you know so I think that in a lot of

280
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,199
ways it that the to your point too it's

281
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,459
this is not a normal consumer package

282
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,500
goods and I think that that's the

283
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:21,239
biggest takeaway is what I've learned is

284
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,039
that people really need to stop looking

285
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,039
at this like a

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,339
a static easy to process finite thing

287
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,940
cannabis is a magical mysterious

288
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:37,980
mystical plant medicine and this

289
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,540
approach that's this copy and paste

290
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,420
approach of all your Sops from whatever

291
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,919
you know tobacco or alcohol distributor

292
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,139
you used to work with or whatever sales

293
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,240
book you were taught 15 years ago

294
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,679
whatever book you read it doesn't apply

295
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,799
here and I think that what we forget

296
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,599
sometimes is to really listen deeply to

297
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,338
your point listen deeply to where it's

298
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,379
going to land and also be honest about

299
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,480
the fact that this is still only going

300
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,399
to be able to be seen in very specific

301
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,039
ways maybe to the on the YouTube channel

302
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,399
if YouTube continues allowing it but the

303
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,259
bands make us have to be really creative

304
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,600
um you know Simone talks a lot about you

305
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,220
know humor and bringing that into it to

306
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
make things more shareable and we can

307
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,240
talk about that too but I think that

308
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,700
that's the biggest prevention for us to

309
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,980
normalizing and and removing the stigma

310
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,839
is that we're not getting access to

311
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,539
mainstream in a way that's not the same

312
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,420
typical messaging of the Snoop dogs The

313
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:33,059
Wiz khalifas the um the Willie Willie

314
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,979
Nelsons it needs to feel really

315
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,958
thoughtful and not just something that

316
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,060
is just you know putting a square peg

317
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,500
into a round hole we need to be really

318
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,939
really thoughtful about it and I think

319
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,399
that that's what it's lacking is there's

320
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,860
a lot of eagerness and arrogance without

321
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,778
real data behind it which is what you

322
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,639
specialize in well we try

323
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,379
umika so you a lot of what you do is on

324
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,240
YouTube so can you kind of talk about

325
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,980
you know to Luna's points some of the

326
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,019
challenges that you have with your work

327
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,459
on YouTube and how you you sort of try

328
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,459
and mitigate those and overcome them

329
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:04,500
yeah let me say I I must say I have

330
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:07,138
YouTube and Instagram and it's it's

331
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,940
quite the same but for me it's for me in

332
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,220
personal Instagram is a little bit

333
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,260
easier YouTube is more streak when it

334
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,860
comes to cannabis but I have a

335
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,659
restriction on both channels which is uh

336
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,300
about two reasons for it on the one hand

337
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:24,120
we have the restrictions of YouTube of

338
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,399
Instagram of the platforms which are not

339
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,039
transparent at all that's a big problem

340
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,399
nobody knows what we're dealing with

341
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,679
nobody knows the rules so I actually

342
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,019
it's a kind of Lottery if I upload a

343
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,838
video and I always hope it's not being

344
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,700
related or something like this so and on

345
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,620
the other hand in Germany we have a very

346
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,959
special situation which makes the

347
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,240
marketing uh quite difficult because

348
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,500
cannabis is a legal medicine and federal

349
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,959
uh uh on federal basis so

350
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,240
um it's also cons it's considered as a

351
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,719
legal narcotic and you're not allowed to

352
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,539
advertise for legal narcotics not at all

353
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,000
so what do the companies do because we

354
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,099
have meanwhile nearly 200 strains in the

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,078
pharmacy and everybody wants to

356
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,720
advertise for this trade they want to

357
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,719
book influences but influencers are not

358
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,879
allowed to sell

359
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,940
advertisements to companies for legal

360
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,759
narcotics so you have to be tricky you

361
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,680
know you have to be tricky when it comes

362
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,419
to the invoice you have to reach even

363
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,759
when it comes to the video to the

364
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,139
posting because you're not allowed to

365
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,419
advertise but you're allowed to mention

366
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:36,419
the medicine so what they do they call

367
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,519
they also focus on patient on patient

368
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,120
groups you know because patient groups

369
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,759
are very safe to advertise with but it's

370
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,519
not advertisement it's not official

371
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,159
advertising so it's but it does not it

372
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,500
does not work in the classic way we used

373
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,319
to advertise velocity I come from the

374
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,379
from the magazine business originally I

375
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,778
used to write and be Chief editor for a

376
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,480
chief editorial several cannabis

377
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:05,519
magazines and um

378
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,620
that doesn't work anymore so good you

379
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,919
know if you don't have social media it's

380
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,959
very hard to do advertising or to to uh

381
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:14,639
to promote a product in the in the kind

382
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,899
of position well I think this goes to

383
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
Simone's remember we were talking about

384
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,220
education Simone you were talking the

385
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,320
way around this is don't be salesy it's

386
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,360
it and it shouldn't it shouldn't have to

387
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,519
first of all weed cells itself did I say

388
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,560
that yeah that sounds small you said

389
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,539
just make it so that it's not it's like

390
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,000
you you're doing it for Education where

391
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:35,519
it's undeniable that the purpose and the

392
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,139
intent was to educate

393
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,419
because that's really the empowerment

394
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,459
that's the true influencers is I respect

395
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:43,379
you guys and if I see you using

396
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,500
something I trust that it's good because

397
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,179
of your legitimizing validating

398
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,740
pre-veting it's trust and relationship

399
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:51,899
so that's how you've been getting around

400
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,180
it like my advice is always don't

401
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,159
hashtag anything don't tag anyone who's

402
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,078
Shadow banned don't smoke on camera and

403
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,639
Simone actually really inspired me he

404
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,559
was like it's not really about that it's

405
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,060
about being really conscious and

406
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,259
building it out do you I mean I don't

407
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,179
know if you wanted to speak to it but I

408
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,159
think it's brilliant no thank you very

409
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:11,159
much for those words I didn't say that's

410
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,980
not true yeah no no but

411
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,100
um I guess the point is that at this

412
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:21,180
when we started we focused on education

413
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,879
and it happens that I was I was a script

414
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:26,698
writer for a comedy show back in the day

415
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,500
so I was writing jokes for a living I'm

416
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:29,399
super funny don't worry it will come it

417
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,019
will come

418
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,879
and but we realized that it was a very

419
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,860
hostile marketing environment back in

420
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,399
the day we realized that guidelines were

421
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:44,399
not going to play in our favor so we we

422
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,220
figured this out when people laugh they

423
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,220
will share the content so that's a way

424
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,800
to hack the algorithm that will not show

425
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,019
you on any feed basically that's what's

426
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,719
happening all our media is done already

427
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm Shadow Bonnie if you like look for

428
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,339
me in on Instagram or anything we won't

429
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,759
appear unless you like write the

430
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:09,000
specific username for all of our

431
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,279
platforms but we still grow every every

432
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,160
week we grow a couple thousand followers

433
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,039
and it's like more massive and and

434
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,140
stronger in in different platforms and

435
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,000
this is because people are sharing the

436
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,280
content especially because it's

437
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,980
educational we always try to teach

438
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:29,339
something if it's how to use a vaporizer

439
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,819
or a bond so be it we will take a big

440
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:35,220
sleep and get super high on camera but

441
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,319
we were showing how to use the bong and

442
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,740
why is this better or worse for you on

443
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:43,859
or what should be aware of when using a

444
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,919
bong or a vaporizer like like straight

445
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:50,819
forward information and we make it funny

446
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,620
by being kind of a honest and genuine to

447
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,079
all the feelings that you experience

448
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,519
when doing this yes I think that's very

449
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,079
I think there's a really important point

450
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,179
about authenticity there that I do want

451
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,339
to come back to but just before we go to

452
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,679
that maybe just to take a slight step

453
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,699
back because it seems to me when we do

454
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,038
have a lot of people here who aren't

455
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,120
actively engaged already in marketing it

456
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,099
seems to me that there's a bit of a

457
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,599
paradox around social media because on

458
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:14,579
the one hand you guys are saying it's

459
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,079
the most important element but on the

460
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:17,939
other I've seen people say before you

461
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,279
need to avoid social media try and drive

462
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,740
people to your website Etc so they're

463
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,418
both true though but I know two things

464
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,220
can be true at the same time yeah but

465
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,679
but how do you you balance those things

466
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,538
and then I guess more concretely if you

467
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,440
guys are going to use social media or if

468
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:33,298
people here are going to use social

469
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,220
media what is the best social media

470
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,379
platform for cannabis in your guys

471
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,000
opinion so again I don't know who wants

472
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,020
to to kick off labeling do you want to

473
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,339
have a go with that one I mean

474
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:43,500
definitely to your point the website

475
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,599
right you can own it you can update it

476
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,298
you can shut it down you can you can see

477
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,859
how the dwell time how where they're

478
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:51,119
going from what page to what how long

479
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,099
they're staying there what they're

480
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,538
slowing down on it's a really awesome

481
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,038
resource

482
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:57,779
um also it just gets them to see your

483
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,058
branding and your voice instead of it

484
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:03,178
being you know through the LinkedIn

485
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:05,160
filter through the Twitter filter and

486
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,480
obviously a lot of you guys know um I

487
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,259
think the hoova app is actually pretty

488
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
cool

489
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,160
um but LinkedIn really is the only place

490
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,440
that's not Banning us I can use hashtags

491
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,480
with cannabis I can share stories not

492
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,279
worry about being policed and there's

493
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,720
people on LinkedIn that are really in

494
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,980
the B2B space it sounds like that's

495
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,660
really relevant

496
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,579
um I find that that's the best place to

497
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,500
stay away from some of the lower

498
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,000
vibrational energies people who really

499
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
have their stuff together are on

500
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,500
LinkedIn they're coming to these

501
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,359
conferences and in a lot of ways I think

502
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,160
that that's the to your point about

503
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,619
doing both you know there's the consumer

504
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,240
brand acknowledgment on the social side

505
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,979
and then there's the legitimacy with

506
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,660
other sophisticated professionals that

507
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,640
want to see people that really know what

508
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,960
they're doing and and care about making

509
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,240
this happen because there's a lot of

510
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,038
talk and not much action and we got to

511
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,960
get this going like if we don't do it

512
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,220
it's going to be all kinds of other

513
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,660
folks that are not going to do it right

514
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,960
and so for the people who've built it

515
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,720
let's let's do it right can I compliment

516
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,120
those and this is just like uh when you

517
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,880
acknowledge that your website it's going

518
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,798
to be a free platform for you to kind of

519
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,140
do whatever you want in this space and

520
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,418
and when you're navigating these

521
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,259
difficult Waters of kind of the social

522
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:18,538
media or kind of in social media uh how

523
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:21,298
many of you guys like publish written

524
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:23,940
content in your websites to look for SEO

525
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:26,940
positioning

526
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,340
all right so all of us should be doing

527
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,080
that if we are aware that our that we

528
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,659
all our websites should have a Blog

529
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:36,240
space and how many of you are are aware

530
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,940
of chat gbt by this point on are using

531
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,319
it in your okay this is a huge trick for

532
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:46,380
us when you prompt DPT for SEO

533
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,779
positioning or SEO enhanced cannabis

534
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,580
content this is the way that you can

535
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,319
easily position your website even

536
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:55,199
without showing the actual content but

537
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:58,379
you can you can go into that SEO ranking

538
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,380
easily now uh with these tools so what I

539
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,380
would recommend is to work on that uh

540
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,919
block kind of a space in your website

541
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,820
using this new uh AI

542
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,620
um software or AI just AI sorry but yeah

543
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:15,418
that's that's a trick that we are now

544
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,298
using and it has helped us a lot to

545
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,860
especially e-commerce yeah you could do

546
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:22,200
a whole other session probably an AI and

547
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:25,199
cannabis will come in there I think yeah

548
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,179
let me say uh I'm doing cannabis content

549
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,360
I think I started on YouTube my first

550
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,538
channel in 2006 at that time Stoner

551
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,779
content worked very well meanwhile

552
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:38,519
Stoner content does not work at all for

553
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,099
two reasons on the one side we have all

554
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,259
this restrictions on the platforms but

555
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:46,019
on the other side people want to have

556
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,279
serious information about cannabis they

557
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:49,079
don't want they don't want to see the

558
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,879
storage stuff anymore you know of course

559
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,038
some young people are still successful

560
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,900
with this you know but people who are

561
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,179
really interested in the industry people

562
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,980
who are interested to be in a legal

563
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,900
industry they don't want to have this

564
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,279
Stoner stuff they want to they don't

565
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,740
want to see it and I wouldn't say

566
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,480
there's a best platformer for my content

567
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:11,940
but I can I can tell you the more

568
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,819
serious my I make my content the more

569
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,759
research the more time I invest in my

570
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:19,678
content the more followers I have the

571
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,619
better the best impact is the good

572
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,960
content in my eyes yeah so there was

573
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,579
that pointer and authenticity and and

574
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,140
sort of you know making sure that

575
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,240
whatever you're releasing and whatever

576
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,860
channel is is real and speaking to the

577
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,599
consumer so Stephen I know you guys do

578
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,579
events and so on like how do you keep it

579
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,099
real in terms of of what you try to do

580
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:39,480
to get the message out love it um I'll

581
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,158
approach this from a little bit of a

582
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,079
different angle I'm kind of more of a

583
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,539
looted I'm not very active on social

584
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,319
media and I'm kind of the front-facing

585
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:50,819
guy at these types of events and uh more

586
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,099
or less doing the a lot of the back end

587
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,480
work and it's funny when I hear educated

588
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,519
and power it's like it's stripped like

589
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,319
straight from our training manual I

590
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:00,298
truly think that those two are those are

591
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,178
the two most powerful World words that

592
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:05,700
can be used in almost any industry

593
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,900
um here's a quick example on a marketing

594
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,058
technique that we do when you start

595
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,740
getting front-facing now like like I

596
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:14,339
said we open up the very first retail

597
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,440
store and uh uh in Canada we did just

598
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:18,538
out of this one store 14.7 million

599
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,179
dollars worth of sales in one year we

600
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:22,798
were processing about 650 people today

601
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,900
and you bet your ass how's the best damn

602
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,519
salesman there and that's that's

603
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,440
something that I absolutely love and

604
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,179
when you have 600 skus and you have

605
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,620
somebody that comes in there and they're

606
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,360
just like wide-eyed and just

607
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,459
bushy-tailed being like Oh my God

608
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,479
there's [ __ ] weed here sorry for my

609
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,340
language

610
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,980
um it's it's really special and you want

611
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,839
to be able to refine 600 different skus

612
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,940
to something that they actually want and

613
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,079
not trying to be the be all and end all

614
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,380
the cannabis

615
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,899
so back to education and Empower us five

616
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,600
open-ended questions and I can drill 600

617
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,860
skus down to about five or six and

618
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,899
they're the ones that are making the

619
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,158
decisions right you were asking them

620
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,620
questions it's like you Choose Your Own

621
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,440
Adventure book you and you end up at the

622
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:06,599
end result based on your decisions

623
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,538
and that's where you can in my opinion

624
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:12,000
is really the strongest form of eye to

625
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,460
eye marketing that results in them

626
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,599
promoting your customers become your

627
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,940
promoters

628
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,219
I don't need to put my like semi-pretty

629
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,600
face like all over speaking eloquently

630
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,880
doing all of these things to be able to

631
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,279
attract attention I train people that

632
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,720
are able to actually authentically show

633
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,460
the passion that they have otherwise we

634
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,140
don't hire them obviously basic

635
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,058
competency needs to be there yada yada

636
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,100
yada hiring practices are important I

637
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:36,899
assure you but when you're able to

638
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,579
actually educate people and Empower them

639
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,740
to make decisions it opens up an entire

640
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:43,259
different pathway in their break they're

641
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,000
the boss not you and all of a sudden

642
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,440
they feel empowered they feel educated

643
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,119
they feel more knowledgeable they walk

644
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,400
out of there with one a product that

645
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,319
they very likely are going to enjoy more

646
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,419
because you helped guide them down that

647
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,859
pathway and then all of a sudden they're

648
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,840
your influencer

649
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,058
if you looked at how many people were

650
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,519
tagging hello cannabis there were 25

651
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:04,798
stores in Ontario province of 14 million

652
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,019
people we had people driving literally

653
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,298
two hours passing by four other stores

654
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:13,139
to get to my store that's a fact people

655
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:16,139
taking a city bus across Hamilton which

656
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,940
is like 30 kilometers to get into our

657
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,799
store instead of walking distance there

658
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,419
we had the same products

659
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,819
same products

660
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,860
it is seriously as simple as educating

661
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,960
and empowering building an actual

662
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,519
experience around this experiential

663
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,220
marketing I think is absolutely critical

664
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,079
I'm we don't we use social media but

665
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,880
it's really through other people at our

666
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,038
stores we start running real events we

667
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,260
did Magic the Gathering we called Magic

668
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,658
the gunging I think that's a stupid name

669
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,759
but it's hilarious and we sold out

670
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,740
we have 40 people playing a magic the

671
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,740
car Magic the Gathering card tournament

672
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,419
you charge a front fee and we put it in

673
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,919
the back room and like

674
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,720
probably shouldn't be putting this on

675
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,278
though

676
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,640
yeah the cat's out of the bag anyways we

677
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,140
did it screw you AGCO please like this

678
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,120
is really important like there were

679
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,278
simple rules that you can do where you

680
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,739
were able to kind of just touch that

681
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,599
line of legality but I'll stand in front

682
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,419
of a judge and be like please explain by

683
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,819
having a car tournament here is against

684
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,340
the law like there's no illegal gambling

685
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,379
here there is no excessive consumption

686
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:21,599
that's happening here we are bringing

687
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,760
like-minded people together with a niche

688
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,439
market that they actually enjoy and you

689
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,079
bet your ass that every single person

690
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,940
that was there was filming was talking

691
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,259
about you combine 40 people in all of

692
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,360
the social media

693
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,679
tagging what's not us doing it we're not

694
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,538
getting Shadow Man

695
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,798
right you had 40 different people saying

696
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:40,500
like this is the coolest thing in the

697
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:41,879
world like I I'm smoking cannabis and

698
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,798
I'm playing a magic the Gathering

699
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,240
tournament that's the authenticity piece

700
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:46,918
right well yeah I mean authentically

701
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Community I guess is the same whether

702
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,400
it's a digital one or a woman in the

703
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,019
real world so Linda I know you do

704
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,519
Advanced networking as well what's your

705
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,700
experience with boats or how do you go

706
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,500
about I mean for us it's it's showing up

707
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,240
and doing good work we all know that

708
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,980
there's a lot of business to be had but

709
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,259
not forgetting the people of color that

710
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,058
have been hit by the War on Drugs not

711
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,980
forgetting um the women in the Cannabis

712
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,298
industry they're getting pushed out it's

713
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,360
International women's month yesterday

714
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:14,460
was International women's day so we

715
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:16,199
really want to you know have good

716
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,058
campaigns that center around black

717
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,278
history month so for example every day

718
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:23,158
we posted on our story a different black

719
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:25,019
cannabis company that was owned by folks

720
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,460
of color to support

721
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,980
um this month we're doing all kinds of

722
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,740
work to feature women one of our dab

723
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,200
rigs goes to donating to the pollinator

724
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,538
project to conserve bees we work with

725
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,960
veterans groups we do really flexible

726
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:41,700
financing for small craft businesses and

727
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,980
farmers in California that can't afford

728
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,960
to buy Hardware their cartridges or

729
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,360
their disposables up front and we can

730
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,519
help work out flexible terms so this

731
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,740
authenticity and this this you know to

732
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,058
your point the the building of the brand

733
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,400
loyalty where everyone becomes an

734
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:58,319
evangelist that's been huge when I

735
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,820
helped start Jetty extracts one of the

736
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,538
first cartridge companies in California

737
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:05,579
back in 2014 there was not really a

738
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:07,038
compassion project like the shelter

739
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:10,379
project which we were giving away

740
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:12,900
unlimited cannabis to anyone who signed

741
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,179
up for a program that was fatally or not

742
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,460
even fatally ill but had severe illness

743
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,860
usually cancer but we worked with

744
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,940
everyone and we did we customized to

745
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:22,859
your point you know it's like what

746
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,980
exactly is your goal is it a teacher is

747
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:28,199
it CBD what's the ratio and people were

748
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,538
when we went into clubs we weren't the

749
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,580
cheapest we weren't the most well-known

750
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:34,619
but with that story that helped them

751
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,240
understand that their budtenders had

752
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,859
something exciting to tell the clients

753
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,720
when they walked in this is what you're

754
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,579
supporting you buy one you give one

755
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,980
you're doing more and you're building

756
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:45,720
love and health in your life while

757
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,460
you're doing it for for yourself for

758
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,380
other people and I think that that's

759
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,960
part of what our events do we do first

760
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,480
Friday we're in Venice California near

761
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,100
the beach so there's an art walk be

762
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,538
first Friday we open up our offices

763
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:59,278
which is just a court you know it's

764
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:00,658
looks like a corporate office and the

765
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,579
whole Community can come in and learn

766
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,778
about dabbing these are people who don't

767
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:05,519
have to pay anything they're just right

768
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:06,659
off the street and they get to they'll

769
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,220
walk by throughout the month and be like

770
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,620
hey I Aspire and call up to our office

771
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,419
because we're accessible and we feel

772
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:14,219
real people are tired of fake

773
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,659
storytelling they're tired of being

774
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,058
marketed too they're tired of having

775
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,340
their intelligence insulted so I think

776
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:22,918
that this authenticity thing is is not

777
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,439
only to to have longevity in the market

778
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,240
but to actually gain people's trust

779
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,038
which is I think the hardest and most

780
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,440
vital thing to actually be successful in

781
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,558
the Cannabis space yeah so operating in

782
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,940
good faith I think is what I'm hearing

783
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:37,500
you're someone who straddles the line

784
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,778
between media and marketing you work as

785
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,220
a freelance journalist you're also

786
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,019
um you know working in influencing and

787
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,538
so on there's a question around

788
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:47,220
authenticity there I guess as well you

789
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:49,319
know how important is it that those two

790
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,880
things stay separate how do you manage

791
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,898
the kind of relationship between

792
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,220
marketing media Etc

793
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:58,379
um

794
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,960
I told you and when we talked before

795
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,600
this is what I sometimes Miss in the

796
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,640
Cannabis industry is the grade of

797
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,298
professionality we have in other media

798
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:12,480
because I can be I can do some criticism

799
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:17,700
I can consider some uh topic critical

800
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,740
critically but still uh the the produce

801
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,380
of that product can advertise in my

802
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,659
magazine or on my channel which which is

803
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,520
uh you know there's no contradiction in

804
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,159
it and

805
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,740
um what I'll miss a little bit if if you

806
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,640
have customers they expect to influence

807
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,259
your content and that is very that that

808
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,179
does not work on the long range because

809
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:41,879
people are sick of this kind of

810
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,220
marketing and what we talked about so if

811
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,778
you if if you do this unhonest marketing

812
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,480
if you're not honest with your marketing

813
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:50,700
here you won't be influenced a long time

814
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,819
you know you people will not trust you

815
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,860
so this is very important that they're

816
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:58,918
in the Cannabis industry we have the

817
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:01,500
Great profit of professionality like in

818
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,919
other industry that you can do critical

819
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,319
content but still have Partners from the

820
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,480
industry and they don't they are not

821
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,639
upset if you write a critical article

822
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,579
about this one's trade because it's just

823
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,020
not tasty you know and you can and you

824
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:18,538
can still be a partner of that company

825
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,099
but this one's train is just not tasty

826
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:21,839
you know and they they shouldn't try to

827
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:24,298
influence that I know we have the same

828
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,579
problems in the in the US I used to work

829
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:27,898
for two platforms from the US you know

830
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:29,819
and they know there were the same

831
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:32,099
problems and I always hated that and

832
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:33,960
told the people please consider it on

833
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:36,298
the long range you have to build up a

834
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,419
credibility and reputation you know and

835
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:41,460
this doesn't work if you know say that

836
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,679
that we deserve that the tastes like

837
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,778
hell and makes you helps but it doesn't

838
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,759
doesn't take good and good in the test

839
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,259
Boot and then and doesn't doesn't help

840
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,000
no it doesn't lose your pain you know

841
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:53,339
I'm sitting beside one of the most

842
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,079
authentic people in cannabis in in

843
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:57,959
Europe and he's he's right here no

844
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,819
disrespect please but this is as

845
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,440
authentic as it gets

846
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:03,898
um from from brain all the way to his

847
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,298
shell it's something that I think is

848
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:08,339
extremely extremely important

849
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,679
um hiring influencers to promote a

850
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,658
product was a big thing in Canada and it

851
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,720
lasted less than a year and it was like

852
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:19,140
it was deplorable like it was so

853
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,960
flagrantly obvious and deplorable and

854
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,759
I'm I'll put that on the record I don't

855
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,500
care and many of these people are

856
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,538
friends of mine because they're popular

857
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,940
sorry not to interrupt you but this is

858
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:32,158
what is just happening in Germany and

859
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,620
this is also why I tell the people you

860
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,620

to sell weed thank you thanks sorry if

873
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,359
that's just an American problem but it

874
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,579
is so old and boring is that Beyond even

875
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,139
offensive it's just not interesting like

876
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:12,000
we've literally just said like there's

877
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,220
there's booths where it's just like four

878
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,740
attractive women that know absolutely

879
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,480
nothing about cannabis and uh you you've

880
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,000
got a conference with the vast majority

881
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,200
being being male that are just flooding

882
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,298
over there and I'm sitting here going

883
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,360
like what like yeah I'm speechless and

884
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:31,619
I'm a guy that likes speaking no I use

885
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:33,178
my Latino magnetism to kind of sorry so

886
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:34,739
imagine how hard it makes it for women

887
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,140
who actually know their stuff about

888
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,880
cannabis when that becomes the the

889
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,460
Baseline is that if you can just hire

890
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,559
for the beauty then people assume that

891
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,659
all women in the space are just hired as

892
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:47,398
models it's rough

893
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,740
um I I do got to give one very very

894
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:53,119
quick shout out back to I'm very against

895
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,558
this sex sex cells in

896
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,239
unauthentic marketing for sure but I I

897
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:59,700
got to give a big shout out there's an

898
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,839
interesting trick that a colleague of

899
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,519
mine that was actually just speaking

900
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:04,980
previously Alex revich who represents

901
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:08,760
loose Brands they have Edibles that are

902
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,679
penis shaped by the way and uh I he he

903
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,359
jokingly said and I said I got to give

904
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,280
you a shout out for this

905
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:15,960
um sex does sell in many ways but if you

906
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,800
throw cannabis in it like just look out

907
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,500
man

908
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,000
and it's quite comical because in Canada

909
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,800
we can't even have anything that is

910
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,239
Catered towards children like you if you

911
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,740
have like a marshmallow that's like

912
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,098
Lucky Charms or something like that or

913
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,500
anything catered to a very subjective

914
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,599
term which is like excitement or if you

915
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,179
take if you take cannabis you are going

916
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,639
to feel better which last I checked you

917
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,220
do anyways

918
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,378
um we can't Market to that and they were

919
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:46,259
able to actually get a health Canada

920
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:48,779
approved medical product that is a penis

921
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,580
shaped animal and you can see the

922
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,820
dimples on my face right now they're not

923
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:56,398
lying it's bloody hilarious

924
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,800
it is absolutely hilarious and it's used

925
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,480
as medicine they did this like I all

926
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,519
that you I'll let you speak to him for

927
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,500
it everybody has I'm talking about it

928
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:07,199
right now and people are listening right

929
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,000
that's marketing and in my opinion this

930
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,679
is not using sex to sell but this is a

931
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,199
basically like it's a little bit of a

932
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,338
middle finger so the marketing you know

933
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,679
I guess the problem comes when everyone

934
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:18,900
starts doing it but I mean on that

935
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:22,019
bombshell we've got about nine minutes

936
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,160
left in the panel so I want to throw it

937
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,019
open to the audience because we want to

938
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,519
make sure that you guys have a chance to

939
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:28,739

940
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:31,440

it to one or two sentences and make sure

948
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,760
it's okay go ahead please be brief we

949
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,740
don't need to hear the whole global

950
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,480
history of cannabis

951
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:53,279
uh before you ask your question we're

952
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,440
all relatively familiar with it that's

953
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,300
all I was gonna say thank you thank you

954
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,159
questions

955
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,800
apparently you have given them all the

956
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:06,719
information they need there must be one

957
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,579
question at least one thank you

958
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,639
I wore my comfortable shoes I wanted to

959
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:13,680
walk around and everything here we go

960
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:15,059
thank you very for a very stimulating

961
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,799
talk

962
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:19,739
um in terms of marketing and social

963
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,560
media platforms I what are your thoughts

964
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:24,719
on Tinder recently announcing that they

965
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,338
allow it but from what I've read it's a

966
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,059
bit more complicated than that what can

967
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:29,059
you tell us about that

968
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,820
are you saying that it's a selection

969
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,820
when you're in your dating profile to

970
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,000
say 420. we can see where your mind's at

971
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,000
girl

972
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:47,338
that was just PR if you actually look at

973
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,719
it they just want the advertising money

974
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,338
but they're not actually more friendly

975
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,598
to cannabis and they kept up the bands

976
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,739
they just are saying that they're gonna

977
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,838
accept money but they're still gonna

978
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:57,059
have to go through the same the same

979
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,559
rigmarole they're just it I think it was

980
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:00,719
to look good but if you look at it

981
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,279
they're not cannabis friendly they're

982
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,379
just willing to look at our money which

983
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,940
is what everyone does no they're not

984
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,920
they're not trying to be revolutionary

985
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,500
don't get lost in the headline they

986
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,380
don't they do not care about cannabis in

987
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,960
Chile we use a grinder or they use a lot

988
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,200
of grinder but they used to sell drugs

989
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,659
there and a lot of people use my face to

990
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,819
sell weed in grinder that's just my

991
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:26,699
goodness but I think it was funny face

992
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,500
they were smart people use a lot of

993
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:31,019
things

994
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,079
man I thought it was Mark I mean I mean

995
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:36,719
we really should be aware of the fact uh

996
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,619
that we talk about the product even if

997
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:43,799
it's legal where advertisement band will

998
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:47,338
be ever average most countries with

999
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,880
legalizing cannabis will have an

1000
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:52,980
advertisement ban I mean maybe some have

1001
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,440
a total advertisement ban in some other

1002
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,780
countries you may advertise up to a

1003
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,059
certain level but in general we're

1004
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,000
talking about a product which will need

1005
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:05,279
never be free to be advertised like

1006
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,858

00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,740
buddy I'm less than a kilometer away

1012
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,759
because any other questions yeah there's

1013
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,019
a question here and the question there

1014
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,660
we're gonna go here cool

1015
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:26,940
first thanks for mentioning about sexism

1016
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:27,960
in the the media because this is very

1017
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,639
important and I hope everyone

1018
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,400
understands very well what we're

1019
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:35,400
speaking about and second I would like

1020
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,700
to ask about advices on how to educate

1021
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,858
people in terms of media and like in all

1022
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:43,199
General things because that's what's

1023
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:45,119
really important now and for the future

1024
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,519
because for people that really doesn't

1025
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,280
know about THC or something like this

1026
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,480
they just judge or they really like if

1027
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,960
they don't smoke they don't know about

1028
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,659
even like Health part of the canops

1029
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,240
world so it's extremely important for us

1030
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:02,519
that works with media to show up like

1031
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:05,939
how to educate these people that it's

1032
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:09,358
not intro the the smoke smokers like

1033
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,220
group let's say I'd love to tackle this

1034
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,199
if you don't mind with respect to the

1035
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:14,819
educating empowerment one of the biggest

1036
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,460
platforms that we started was the

1037
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,619
goodbye opioids campaign I'm an opioid

1038
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,420
Survivor after a surgery I've got 17

1039
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,400
screws on my feet that's why I have

1040
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,519
these wonderful in case anybody wants to

1041
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,500
make fun of me but um uh it's it's

1042
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,480
really truly about education we did that

1043
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,039
you start that at the top right I'm face

1044
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,260
to face with all these different doctors

1045
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,239
78 different doctors refer patients to

1046
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,740
my clinic if you're able to educate

1047
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,059
people at the top as a trickle-down

1048
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:41,578
effect and you don't even need social

1049
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,259
media for that so you spend you gather

1050
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,880
up all the data you're able to get

1051
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,740
somebody that's able to speak to the

1052
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,720
same level of them to be able to educate

1053
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,159
and Empower them that trickle-down

1054
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,598
effect happens all the way and it

1055
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,460
happens even in my Corporation with

1056
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,619
respect to educating you Empower all of

1057
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,480
my senior staff they then educate and

1058
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,039
Empower all the managers those managers

1059
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,079
then educate and Empower all of the

1060
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,820
employees and those employees educated

1061
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,980
and Empower every single different

1062
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,480
Citizen and patient alike so it's it's

1063
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,579
about really getting to the top and

1064
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,380
being able to educate and Empower real

1065
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,619
influencers not even outside of social

1066
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,240
media and there is a plethora of data

1067
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,858
both medical and recreational on

1068
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,358
different cannabinoids flavonoids

1069
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:20,519
terpenes how they different how they

1070
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,858
interact with everybody if you want to

1071
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,239
dive into all of the stuff like like eat

1072
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:27,119
your heart out like let's go it's like

1073
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,799
my biggest passion and like clinical

1074
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,599
trials research reports like we have

1075
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,579
literally over 3 000 research reports

1076
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,519
that we've compiled both on on the

1077
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:37,380
medical basis you take that data you use

1078
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,659
that to educate people you Empower them

1079
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,480
to be able to educate other people and

1080
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:45,679
so on and so on and so on and you know

1081
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,719
first can I ask I have a quick question

1082
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,259
hi I'm easy to spot

1083
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,759
um

1084
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,099
one of the challenges though because

1085
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,420
okay we we have we have access to all

1086
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,039
this data and all these files and you

1087
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,260
know it and I know it I got an Instagram

1088
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:00,300
you got an Instagram you can post till

1089
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,460
you turn blue in the face right I mean I

1090
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,800
got 71 000 Instagram followers and if I

1091
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,480
post a weed meme Instagram loves that

1092
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,640
and I get thousands of likes but if I

1093
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,920
post some sort of thing about

1094
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,900
real cannabis you know here's a picture

1095
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,240
of some cannabis or here's some this is

1096
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,700
what these different terpenes do they

1097
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,739
kind of squash that one absolutely and

1098
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:22,199
so how do you how do you reach beyond

1099
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:24,539
that is the question how do you get

1100
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,799
around that where's the documentary

1101
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:28,019
doesn't everyone love watching movies

1102
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,160
get your get these folks to me what

1103
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,019
you're saying is where people come

1104
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:32,819
before but the app that comes first is

1105
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:35,759
the why that's why that would be my

1106
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,579
answer is get them to watch us get them

1107
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,099
to watch giving RSL or CBD to a to a

1108
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,900
child having a grand mal seizure Leaf

1109
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:47,099
the bubble you know what I'm saying have

1110
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,660
them have a story told of of and pop the

1111
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,880
bubble leave the bubble and pop it that

1112
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:52,980
once they see the why then they're

1113
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,300
fascinated by the research but there's

1114
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,059
documentaries out there there's many

1115
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,920
documentaries like it this now cannabis

1116
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,119
or there's Beautiful Stories I think

1117
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,380
that it has to start with the story of

1118
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,880
people seeing that this is not a joke

1119
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,579
this isn't about us wanting to get high

1120
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,800
this is a life-saving intervention that

1121
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:09,780
has been grown and cultivated for

1122
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,280
thousands of years by indigenous people

1123
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,200
and women that's the other thing this is

1124
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,880
our Birthright this isn't something new

1125
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,500
that's why it's crazy to me the people

1126
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,358
of color in the in the United States and

1127
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,679
all around the world are extra scared of

1128
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:20,759
this it makes sense that black and brown

1129
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,899
people don't want to get involved

1130
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,859
they're not mad at the plant they don't

1131
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,599
have an issue with the plant they don't

1132
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:27,119
want problems with the boys yeah in my

1133
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,220
eyes it's also very important uh if

1134
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,440
you're my cannabis content your

1135
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,118
orientation is menstrual media you know

1136
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,519
you want to reach out you want to leave

1137
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,880
the bubble so look how my social media

1138
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:42,259
works and to use the same tools like

1139
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,519
mainstream media make serious

1140
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,440
then you leave the bubble you know I

1141
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,659
have experienced that with a few uh with

1142
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,700
a few not only with a few videos you can

1143
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:53,338
leave the bubble but you have to be very

1144
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:55,799
you have to be taken serious and not to

1145
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:59,239
be taking what I said before taken as

1146
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,240
the stoner you know exactly

1147
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,559
Stoner content exactly and so there I

1148
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,719
noticed there was a lot of B2B people

1149
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,400
here and all of this is completely

1150
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,379
applicable too with this educating and

1151
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
empowered right

1152
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,338
um I would say like Instagram is

1153
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,799
basically B to C right like you're an

1154
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:18,420
influencer it goes directly to C so when

1155
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,740
you start looking at B to B which is

1156
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,619
what I was talking about with respect to

1157
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:25,439
talking to a doctor that's B2B and then

1158
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,599
they're B to C right so if I educated

1159
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,119
them I Empower you

1160
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,980
for to buy into cannabis and to buy into

1161
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,200
all of this you then become the

1162
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,780
influencer that's b2c my job is B to B

1163
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:38,818
I'm B2B all day long and I love this b2c

1164
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:42,440
stuff but ultimately I'm using b2c to

1165
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:42,440
talk to B to B sure

1166
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:48,000
yes hello my name is Michael I'm an

1167
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,039
attorney at law in Germany and I was

1168
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,818
wondering how does the industry in the

1169
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:53,960
states

1170
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:56,579
um deal with the fact that the law

1171
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,338
regulating the the advertisement on

1172
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:02,339
social media how does the industry

1173
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:04,559
um pushes its interests into let's say

1174
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:07,440
the legal text since I have something

1175
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,000
here um from Canada it says unless

1176
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,700
authorized under this act it is

1177
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,159
prohibited to promote cannabis by

1178
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:16,379
presenting it or any of its brand

1179
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,539
elements in a manner that Associates

1180
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,480
yeah vague it's like it's everything

1181
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,679
it's everything to to me's point it's

1182
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,358
like it's not they're not even

1183
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:25,799
transparent about it so we have people

1184
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:27,779
that are part-time they literally

1185
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,220
they're spending money and every day

1186
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,380
having a right to Instagram to get

1187
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:33,719
unbanned like it's they're doing it to

1188
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,519
Tire us out this is the problem with the

1189
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,699
system they do not want us to heal

1190
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,259
ourselves it's big Pharma it's it's a

1191
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:42,419
military industrial complex all of these

1192
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,819
things it sounds conspiratorial but

1193
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,159
that's to Simone's Point keep bit light

1194
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:48,838
keep it educational keep it funny when

1195
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:50,940
you see the Nike Swoosh you don't you're

1196
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,159
you don't see a picture of a sweating

1197
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,420
person playing basketball they're not

1198
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:56,759
saying what they are if anyone goes to

1199
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,338
HQ it's one of the best clubs in

1200
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,440
Barcelona their sweatshirts just have if

1201
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:03,960
you know you know on the back that we

1202
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,519
don't need to overtly Market this I

1203
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,780
actually appreciate that we need to

1204
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,159
operate a little bit in the shadows

1205
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,319
because this plant deserves a little

1206
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,879
shade it needs a little protection it

1207
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,338
doesn't need to be as exposed and as

1208
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,980
exploited as a Coca-Cola to the example

1209
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:19,078
I think it's smart that we're rolling

1210
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,059
out plant medicine in a thoughtful slow

1211
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,800
way because it deserves that we don't

1212
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:23,940
want this to be a green Rush we've

1213
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,579
already seen what happens it doesn't

1214
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,800

1215

1218
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,940
