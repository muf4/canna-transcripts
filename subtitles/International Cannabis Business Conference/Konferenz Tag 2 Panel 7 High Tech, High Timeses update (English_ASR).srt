for cannabis manufacturers our main one

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,420
being the chico robot a device that

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,759
infuses joints and Blunts and pre-rolls

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,618
with cannabis concentrate among that we

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,560
do a bunch of other various robotics

36
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:31,140
Technologies Vision systems vaporizer

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,939
filling and uh yeah it's interesting

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,680
being here in Berlin and meeting

50
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,340
basically so um thanks

51
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,280
sweet thanks guys appreciate it and

today I have the pleasure of being the

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,560
moderator of this High-Tech high times

54
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,479
panel all right guys so talking about

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,159
where technology is going not just from

56
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,500
The Producers perspective but also the

57
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,840
end consumers how does technology need

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,598
to change to help this industry become

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,039
more successful and safer for the

60
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,378
consumer

61
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,639
You're Gonna Let You Nail this one and

62
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:34,560
then we'll go along

63
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,859
yeah of course um of course the

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,800
vaporizer is a high-tech device yeah we

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,480
know that uh yeah from a design uh

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,939
perspective you need to be very careful

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,419
what you are doing uh people at the end

68
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,219
of the day are inhaling this is uh so so

69
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,878
the vapor you are producing is getting

70
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:56,098
into the lungs so yeah and on the

71
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:59,340
technology side it is very important to

72
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,598
have their very high quality and of

73
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,159
course technology goes through

74
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,318
everything you do it goes through your

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,280
design it goes through your production

76
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:11,399
process things like traceability are

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,439
extremely important in our case to

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,239
produce a medical device it is the

79
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,539
certification is very important like

80
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,599
either selling for 85. we have no new

81
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:25,019
certifications available from UL 8139

82
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,598
it's new standard who is used for

83
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,360
vaporizers uh what VR follow at least

84
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:33,479
with every new product and of course on

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,180
the end on a customer site diet of

86
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,579
course all of our new products they have

87
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,560
coming with an app yeah you're always

88
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,719
able to control your device with SNAP

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,060
but you're also able to get statistics

90
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,680
out of it yeah you can see how long you

91
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,719
used it what is your main temperature

92
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,780
you're using it and of course it gives

93
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,900
also feedback to us once we get a device

94
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,000
back on hand to see how it was used yeah

95
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,158
and how was it if it was if there was a

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,378
failure or what was the failure so it

97
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,579
improves the experience for the customer

98
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:07,560
and it improves our database to make

99
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,180
better products in the future okay great

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,438
loose before I get to you it's

101
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,480
interesting so it's kind of like that

102
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,818
the car model right where the cars are

103
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,199
now analyzing how you're driving it and

104
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,918
feeding that information back to the

105
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,500
oems so what type of improvements have

106
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,359
you guys made based on key data points

107
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,040
that you've collected like from can be

108
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,979
like an example of a product enhancement

109
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,900
you've done that has met consumer Trends

110
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:35,699
or uses

111
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:37,500
yeah in in our case the

112
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,759
what we have seen a lot of seeing how

113
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,680
people are using and which temperature

114
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,740
they are using it right yeah this was

115
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,500
one of the main the main things we got

116
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,379
back and but at the end this is uh what

117
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,899
the car the customer can do by himself

118
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,879
oh interesting all right Lewis now

119
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,239
taking a look at the back-end

120
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,040
infrastructure of any producer and

121
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,079
being from North America and being

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,939
immersed in that market what are certain

123
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,819
things that you are seeing or that you

124
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,759
guys are predicting at metric that the

125
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,978
evolution of data flow from seed to

126
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,600
Consumer but how do how are we making

127
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,219
those more efficient as well for the

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,460
chemistry producers

129
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,740
yeah so um so those of you don't know

130
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,859
metric is uh is a platform that

131
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,900
government uses to collect data from the

132
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,819
supply chain so every actor that is

133
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,038
active along a supply chain in a

134
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:30,538
commercial Market

135
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,978
it contributes data along the supply

136
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,740
chain and ends up being this massive

137
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,839
this massive data set that government

138
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,478
uses to help inform policy and kind of

139
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,819
evolve it over time so what we've seen

140
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,219
happen is is that not only does that

141
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,740
data set really help government be able

142
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,259
to create some efficiencies but it also

143
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,740
serves businesses really well and we

144
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,300
think the future of it is like the is

145
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,519
the potential for information sharing

146
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,259
where businesses and technological

147
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,000
solutions that are contributing or

148
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,400
participating in the platform can

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,560
co-create value with one another along

150
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,060
the entire supply chain so when it comes

151
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,819
to ways in which we're creating

152
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,120
efficiencies in Supply chains first and

153
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,038
foremost the data that's collected in in

154
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,680
track and Trace systems is intended to

155
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,019
be collected during the normal course of

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,939
business when businesses are collecting

157
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,918
data that's important for making

158
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,379
business decisions anyway and then

159
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,939
second because there's been somewhat of

160
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,459
a reluctance some from a very large

161
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,439
technical companies to get involved in

162
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,180
the canvas Industries in particular in

163
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,699
North America and in the US where it's

164
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,280
still illegal federally there's been a

165
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,860
lot of innovation and a lot of new tech

166
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,418
startups that are providing a lot of the

167
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,060
services to businesses to help

168
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,399
streamline some of the reporting

169
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,038
requirements that go to the government

170
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,138
but also be able to streamline and

171
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:53,519
better informed business decisions that

172
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,400
they make throughout the entirety of the

173
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,799
supply chain so it's it ends up being an

174
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,779
ecosystem of data collection that's

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
capable of being shared amongst many

176
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,418
different actors within the in the

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,699
system

178
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:08,519
that's again to sort of build off that

179
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,620
notion of the tech ecosystem within an

180
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,019
organization the one thing that I've

181
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,879
noticed compared to different Industries

182
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,639
we work in other Industries is that the

183
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,800
tech set up at cannabis companies can

184
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,220
get a little over complicated

185
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,079
what are certain things that individuals

186
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,479
or business owners should be aware of

187
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,879
when they want to get into a technology

188
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,860
package is it looking at the ecosystem

189
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,019
that it plays with Integrations are

190
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,939
those important maybe we can just build

191
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,799
a little bit on that yeah so we actually

192
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,860
see both we see

193
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,139
um you know businesses that are still

194
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,720
collecting or or contributing to data

195
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,060
via spreadsheets or even handwriting and

196
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,440
then later adding it into a system and

197
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,079
other companies that have pretty

198
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,918
sophisticated uh internal systems that

199
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,478
they use and because it's important to

200
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,000
create efficiencies within the

201
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,219
marketplace a lot of businesses have

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,019
worked with their software providers to

203
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,580
actually integrate in with the system so

204
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,978
for our for example in our system

205
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,399
there's been over 500 companies that

206
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:13,199
integrate with metric to either to grab

207
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,779
information and get it out of our system

208
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,538
but also to put information back into it

209
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,579
yeah thank you all right let's talk

210
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:23,579
about automation a little bit shall we

211
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,899
so what trends and Evolutions are we

212
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:27,060
going to be able to see how cans

213
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,378
producers actually produce cannabis well

214
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,319
maybe we can touch on that a little bit

215
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,060
yeah I mean the Automation in the

216
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,099
Cannabis industry is I would say Stone

217
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,718
it's an Asian form because the industry

218
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,080
itself is still kind of figuring things

219
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,300
out and to Lewis's Point how he's in

220
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,158
some companies be you know lightly

221
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,979
software driven and some being very

222
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,899
heavy I would say right now there's a

223
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,940
pretty high variability in how much

224
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,059
people use automation to manufacture

225
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,200
finished goods and it plays into the

226
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,119
fact that

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,459
there's so much change in what the end

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,560
product is going to be that it's not

229
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,119
like a traditional manufacturing and not

230
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,039
traditional automation where you can

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,600
build these huge facilities that are

232
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,458
going to pump out hundreds of thousands

233
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,220
of units an hour because there's no

234
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:13,079
volume that's like that so I think we're

235
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,959
going to start seeing automation that

236
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,420
pops up that's things that we make where

237
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,099
all of the devices are made for high

238
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:21,179
variability because this plant is

239
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,800
something that we're still discovering

240
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,958
we're still trying to understand what

241
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,579
are going to be the Staple skus in every

242
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,399
dispensary what are going to be the

243
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,540
Staple skus in every market and we're

244
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,240
also going to start seeing them become

245
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:36,778
smarter so less like dumb automation

246
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,820
that's huge and massive treadmills of

247
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:43,259
products coming down the line

248
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,879
and more small variable iot systems like

249
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:46,980
everything that we make is built off of

250
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,720
a database and all that database is

251
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,100
going to be synced with the Erp system

252
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
of the company and then it's going to be

253
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,940
synced with metric and it's going to be

254
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,200
a much smarter manufacturing because

255
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:01,200
we're not starting this industry in the

256
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,759
1300s OR 1960s like we have you know we

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,440
have the internet and we should embrace

258
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,120
it as we are building out your

259
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,160
automation but let's face it though

260
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,200
people were still smoking weed 1300

261
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,539
years ago yeah they still were smoking

262
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,160
of course they were all right no good

263
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:16,199
question though on that so talk about

264
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,539
the Automation and some people in this

265
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,860
room may have cannabis facilities that

266
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:25,139
produce grow extract Etc what are key

267
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,899
data points they should be looking at in

268
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,699
their operation to inform them that

269
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,679
maybe it's time to move towards an

270
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,940
automated system for production like

271
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,500
what are those key data points that they

272
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,540
should be paying attention to to

273
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,299
understand that the ROI is real and it's

274
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,399
there and they just need to uh got

275
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,079
technology to become efficiently can you

276
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,200
speak on that a little bit yeah actually

277
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,879
so uh me and my team we actually built a

278
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,560
cannabis co-packing company in Oakland

279
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,559
and ran it for three years Oakland

280
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,179
California in the United States and uh

281
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,919
it was surprising because you know we

282
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,559
were a robotics company kind of

283
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,778
sponsoring the development of this uh

284
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,099
Bay Area service provider and we didn't

285
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,439
use a lot of Automation in the beginning

286
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,480
we did it all by hand to make sure we

287
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,820
could understand what exactly the

288
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,680
traditional Market was doing and then

289
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,420
our decision making on like what we

290
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,019
wanted to automate what was the most

291
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:18,740
important was when the balance between

292
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,659
throughput and the ability to hire

293
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,600
became so difficult that it made sense

294
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:25,860
just to automate things because uh the

295
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,980
workforce at least in North America

296
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,860
Canada United States

297
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,800
I think the culture has shifted from

298
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,800
people wanting to sit down and do

299
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,259
knockbox their joints and finish them by

300
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,000
hand it's difficult to hire for that

301
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,179
position and so when you get to the

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
volume level where you can't find you

303
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,759
know another 20 people then it's time to

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,159
make the change into Automation and um

305
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,559
it's most of the time better to do it

306
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,179
later yeah even though I mean I would I

307
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,219
would hope you guys buy my machine the

308
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,099
first day you decide to start a cannabis

309
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,600
company but the best time is really when

310
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,700
you hit that break-even point that

311
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,180
breaking point between can I hire more

312
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,519
people and can I maintain the quality by

313
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,319
having a higher amount of volume and

314
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,899
usually that comes like in the pre-roll

315
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,800
range if you're doing more than 10 000

316
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:22,620
pre-reals a week in the co-packing range

317
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,778
like for jars and bags of flour if

318
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,519
you're doing more than three to five

319
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:29,220
thousand a week it just doesn't make

320
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,899
sense to do those things by hand but

321
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,160
along with the variability that I

322
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,019
mentioned before

323
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,299
you don't really know what you're gonna

324
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,360
do when you first start right and I've

325
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,338
seen many cannabis companies Canada the

326
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,200
United States they'll spend five ten

327
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,880
fifteen million dollars

328
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
building out this whole facility having

329
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,860
this whole idea of what they're going to

330
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,320
do

331
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,778
and then they turn on the lights and

332
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,700
they don't use half the facility or it

333
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,500
turns out the market has shifted and

334
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,600
this product that they were working on

335
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,759
just doesn't make sense anymore or the

336
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,240
form factor has changed or this this new

337
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:06,059
SKU that's coming out right so I would

338
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,159
say start very slow

339
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,078
look at that Breaking Point

340
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,600
and then automate aggressively from

341
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,879
there yeah and if you look at any

342
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,278
industry and the companies who are the

343
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,078
most successful in that industry are the

344
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,419
ones that have been able to reduce the

345
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,879
direct labor component the most so the

346
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,740
more Capital heavy Capital asset heavier

347
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,480
company is for your production

348
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,159
throughput the more competitive you're

349
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,200
going to be and the more consistency

350
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,639
you're going to have and standardization

351
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,879
and product output which is important

352
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,980
okay let's take this to uh mobile

353
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:44,338
devices and vape products and so Hans

354
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,680
where what's the next step for Consumer

355
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,639
interaction with their Vape product and

356
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,138
their Vape mechanism yeah well I just um

357
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,778
I would like to look at this a little

358
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,180
bit from a different perspective

359
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,939
um more from a distribution perspective

360
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,759
maybe you know for d2c products which

361
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,279
are sold to end users and

362
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,439
um there's been a large shift over the

363
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,778
last two decades I would say from the

364
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,660
digitalization of sales really well so

365
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:16,200
it shifted from brick and mortar stores

366
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,819
physical stores to online sales which is

367
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,459
really across all categories it's not

368
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,399
necessarily specific to to cannabis or

369
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,479
high-end you know vaporizers but

370
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,240
um

371
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,519
in B2B transactions for example a

372
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,220
wholesaler today probably needs an

373
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
online portal where his customers his

374
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,220
retailers can actually Place their

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,079
orders otherwise it's going to be in a

376
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,000
very difficult spot

377
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,559
um and you know they they directly

378
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,839
placed their orders outside of the

379
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,399
regular shop working hours so um but

380
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,279
there's also

381
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,019
consequences on d2c transactions when

382
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,879
you set to end users which is probably

383
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,860
even more important and it's it's a

384
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,778
fundamental issue really which have

385
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,360
arised through this digitalization of

386
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:59,399
sales really um maybe maybe let's take

387
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,560
an example let's say

388
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,539
let's say urine decides to buy a new

389
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,299
vaporizer and he walks into his favorite

390
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,819
web shop and you know vaporizer store

391
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,679
head shop in titling and um there's

392
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,240
there's the sales guy behind the counter

393
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,458
let's say his name is Dave

394
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,560
and Dave shows young all the different

395
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,719
vaporizers that are available

396
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,759
um not the advantages disadvantages you

397
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,920
try to understand what what Jung really

398
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,620
needs and wants and at the end of the

399
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,838
pitch after 45 minutes Jung has decided

400
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:32,000
he wants to buy the new Pax Vaporizer

401
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:35,040
okay and the price tag is 250 euros okay

402
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,500
250 euros so

403
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,059
um Jung has decided that's the one he

404
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,679
wants what he's going to do what he's

405
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,659
going to do before actually you know

406
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,219
finishing this transaction completing

407
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:45,659
the transaction handing over the money

408
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,220
to death what he's going to do maybe in

409
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,838
the audience what is what is what is

410
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,379
Young going to do before paying actually

411
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,079
those 250 euros in the store

412
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,759
no one

413
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,179
check the price how he's going to check

414
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,179
the price

415
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,419
he's going to Google it of course I

416
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,579
would argue 80 of customers will Google

417
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,379
the price before putting down 250 euros

418
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,778
so that's what Ewing does he actually

419
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,820
goes the price and he finds it at 185

420
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,799
Euros on Amazon

421
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,100
so um

422
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,599
Dave if he sells the device at 250 euros

423
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,120
he's probably going to make 80 bucks on

424
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,379
it let's say 80 bucks if you sell us to

425
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,639
sell it to you and to complete the

426
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,939
transaction you probably needs to sell

427
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,579
it at 190 maybe 200. so he makes 30

428
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,380
bucks maybe and Dave is not very happy

429
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:33,299
about this he spent an hour with Jurgen

430
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,419
already uh in the stores where other

431
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,578
customers are waiting and he might

432
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,979
reconsider actually restocking that item

433
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:42,299
and in return he's not going to place an

434
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,620
order to his wholesaler and his

435
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,659
wholesaler not going to place in order

436
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,940
to the manufacturer so at the end of the

437
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,620
day it actually becomes a problem for

438
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,620
everyone involved

439
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,299
and there's you know most large online

440
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,278
retailers today they actually work with

441
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,379
pricing bots so these pricing Bots

442
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:59,399
that's it's a software which basically

443
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,980
tracks

444
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,318
online pricing for a certain item a

445
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,439
specific item multiple times during the

446
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,298
day and what the software also can do is

447
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,880
to adjust the pricing for an online

448
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:14,039
store for the specific online store to

449
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,040
actually beat the competitive pricing

450
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,019
beat the competitors and what this ends

451
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,438
up doing is actually downward spiral

452
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,619
where a price goes from 250 to 240 to

453
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,959
230 to 200 you know and just keeps going

454
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,759
down and it's it's a problem for for

455
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,140
retailers obviously because they don't

456
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,480
make their margins anymore even that

457
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,759
online retailer who might sell it at 185

458
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,058
is going to make 15 15 bucks on the

459
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,279
sales that was the hustle probably not

460
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:43,440
so it's you know most a lot of you

461
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,200
probably from the United States where

462
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,440
you got the map pricing

463
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,120
map minimum advertised pricing

464
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,679
um that's if I understand correctly

465
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,418
that's that's you know you can have

466
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,880
agreements with retailers where they're

467
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:58,679
probably where they adhere to sell at a

468
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,080
certain retail price and if they don't

469
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,940
you can send them one morning letters so

470
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,740
this is something in Europe it's very

471
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,080
different it's called price fixing and

472
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,240
it's actually illegal so it's actually

473
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,099
sanctioned with heavy fines so it's

474
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,000
nothing you can really do

475
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:14,459
um

476
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,440
but there's there's other ways you know

477
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,480
um you cannot come up with to influence

478
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,400
and impact that pricing actually I I

479
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,798
really need to put a disclaimer here so

480
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,840
uh the the vaporizer brand I used

481
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,538
earlier and the price is obviously

482
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,220
completely made up right don't take this

483
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,099
too serious please but I just wanted to

484
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,079
illustrate the fundamental issue of this

485
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:35,459
and there's certain ways of how to

486
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,819
control that through selective

487
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,860
distribution you know the the Dave might

488
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,240
be saying I really like you you're you

489
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,798
know I'm going to give you a free grind

490
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,839
I'm going to give you a cleaning kit and

491
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,058
a carrying case and you still going to

492
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,399
sell it for 230 and still gonna make

493
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,839
good money on it you know so

494
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
um but you know different different

495
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,798
companies different approaches uh of how

496
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,900
to actually tackle that propping for

497
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:59,819
example like apple

498
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,140
um they mostly decided set to sell

499
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:02,819
direct now

500
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,340
um where they might work with certain

501
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:07,678
retailers who they only give 10 margins

502
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,019
so they don't actually have the latitude

503
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,640
to play with the pricing that much uh

504
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,400
otherwise they would be operating at law

505
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,700
so it's it's a fundamental issue it's

506
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,798
kind of coming up over the last 10 15 20

507
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,538
years probably and it's becoming more

508
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,058
and more problem and people trying to

509
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:26,960
figure out how to deal with this

510
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:29,879
um so this is an example of where

511
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,460
certain enhancements and technology is

512
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,340
actually hurting the industry yeah we're

513
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,900
providing challenges I mean there's

514
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:39,779
obviously also advantages of

515
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,100
digitalization of sales you know it's

516
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,480
easier for people who live in the

517
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,639
countryside to get products you know

518
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,079
yeah of course okay

519
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,700
we got a few

520
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,960
audience we're going to hand handle

521
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,058
those first and then we're just going to

522
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,558
jump into a general q a afterwards and

523
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:54,480
thank you for those who submitted these

524
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,460
questions ahead of time

525
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,558
first question is how will the Vape

526
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,179
industry be regulated in Germany's

527
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,599
Medical Market

528
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:05,580
so who wants to take that please yeah

529
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,740
The Vape industry of course if you want

530
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,199
to be in a in the German Medical Market

531
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,440
uh you must have a medical device and

532
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,700
medical devices are strongly regulated

533
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,100
um and recently we have strong

534
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,860
regulations through the new MDR the

535
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,659
medical device regulations from the EU

536
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:24,899
yeah we buy was healthier for example

537
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:28,019
next week we have three days audit by

538
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,700
the Dov two Auditors yeah that's fun we

539
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,940
are in Preparation you need a philosophy

540
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,519
for that for these fans so it's a highly

541
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,080
regulated and it's uh it's a it's a

542
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,879
hurdle on the one hand once you have

543
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,500
thunder hurdle not everybody else can do

544
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,299
it if you look to the vaporizers

545
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,640
worldwide uh start some big list the

546
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:46,019
only one who really has done it if you

547
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,700
also claiming it but they are not

548
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,918
available on the market so we have done

549
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,620
it but it's a constant effort you have

550
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,080
to do to be really compliant with a

551
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,699
medical device and it is something

552
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,500
different if there is a medical device

553
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,819
or not it's not only the device itself

554
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,220
who is different it's the whole

555
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,079
management of the company and of course

556
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,538
it has also proved that this really has

557
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:10,019
a therapeutic effect yeah and all this

558
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:11,700
together uh is it is not so easy but you

559
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,679
can do it if you're you know if you're a

560
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,720
well management company yeah and I think

561
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,000
that's gonna let's just kind of build

562
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,960
some clarification there just because a

563
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,839
company says they are ISO 1345 or 9001

564
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,600
certified it doesn't mean the product is

565
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,859
certified the product certification is a

566
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,798
completely different certification with

567
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:33,658
the UL certification or CSA if you're in

568
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,058
Canada for example

569
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,620
um so one of those things that if you

570
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:40,980
see that company is boasting that

571
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,418
they're 9001 or 1345 certified that

572
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,058
doesn't necessarily mean their product

573
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,380
is good I just want to make sure being

574
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:48,658
the iso guy in the room that everyone

575
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,520
knows the stipulations there but that's

576
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:52,320
I mean that's a good point but 1345 I

577
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,740
think it's important because it is a

578
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,079
medical device it is delivering a yeah

579
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,000
yeah certain 485 is one of three things

580
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,339
you have to do if you must have the

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,659
quality management

582
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:06,538
audited according to it then the device

583
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:09,600
itself must be according to depending

584
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:12,599
which device you have a regulated and

585
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:15,538
finally yeah the therapeutic effect must

586
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,819
be proven okay all right so another

587
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:20,158
thank you guys so another question that

588
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,899
has come up uh

589
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,120
and maybe this is something Louis I'd

590
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,380
love to you to handle this one but how

591
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,918
can software and Hardware Integrations

592
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,600
degrees cost in cultivation activities

593
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,538
increased costs no a decrease sorry

594
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,279
decrease costs okay yeah my bad yeah

595
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:37,259
well I think um uh there's a couple

596
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,538
different technologies that can

597
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:41,339
certainly help along those lines so for

598
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:44,579
example in our system we use radio

599
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:47,879
frequency ID tags uh to tag every plant

600
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:50,399
and then every package or batch of

601
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,440
product that comes from those inputs

602
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,600
into the supply chain system and then

603
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,700
those tags can actually be read from a

604
00:22:54,599 --> 00:23:00,240
distance so in in terms of taking an

605
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,880
inventory if you have just a barcode or

606
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,440
a QR code you can usually read one tag

607
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,960
at a time and you have to get awfully

608
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,419
close to the tag to be able to to scan

609
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,880
and pull that information with radio

610
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,259
frequency ID tags you can use a reader

611
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,659
that's going to the same size as a

612
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,819
smartphone with a handle and you can

613
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,860
take an inventory relatively quickly as

614
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:22,740
long as you get within seven meters of

615
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,418
the of the actual RFID tag and you can

616
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,200
pull the information off and then that

617
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,759
that unique identifier that's on the tag

618
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,740
gets you acquainted with all of the data

619
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,000
that has been added into the system from

620
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,798
that so just kind of like put that in

621
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,140
perspective if you had your phone with a

622
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,000
handle on it and every person in this

623
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,400
room had an RFID tag that they were

624
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,619
holding up if you walked up uh this

625
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,200
aisle and down this aisle we'd probably

626
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:47,339
be able to read most every RFID tag in

627
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,779
this and you'll be able to do it in

628
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,699
whatever the time was it took you to

629
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:52,379
walk around the that's incredible and

630
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,919
that all gets fed automatically into

631
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:59,280
metric exactly wow can I uh expand on

632
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,679
that yeah guys please yeah so um we were

633
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,538
this co-packer in Oakland and we started

634
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,919
building a bunch of technology to help

635
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,980
our customers and actually like help our

636
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,320
in-house production and so we did a lot

637
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,720
of hand trimming for people and so when

638
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,158
you trim cannabis as you all know it

639
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,960
doesn't always have the same yield right

640
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,120
some strains a little bit larcier some

641
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,759
strains are a lot more dense and

642
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:24,119
depending on what strain it is is the

643
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:27,538
actual veg time and flowering time is

644
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:29,099
very different and then to compound the

645
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:30,839
complexity of these different strains

646
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,459
some of them are more exotic and some

647
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,319
will go for different pricing so you

648
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,720
take all these variables together

649
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,480
and so what we did is we built this very

650
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,579
awesome Erp system for trimming and I

651
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,500
think you know we talk about later if

652
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,779
that's important for people but what it

653
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,900
did was something very cool right so you

654
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,940
would give a trimmer a pound of flour

655
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,659
and let's say the yield from that flower

656
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,940
was 65 and then you give them another

657
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,760
strain same trimmer same process of

658
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,980
trimming but the pound yield from or

659
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:06,119
sorry the kilogram kilogram yield from

660
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:09,240
there is like uh is maybe 55 so you're

661
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:12,000
getting roughly you know 15 10 less in

662
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,579
this other one however the pricing and

663
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,599
the market pricing for strain number two

664
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:20,158
is significantly higher but as it turns

665
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,899
out it actually takes a longer time to

666
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,900
grow and like an indoor grow maybe it's

667
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,700
14 weeks compared to 11 weeks and so

668
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,100
what you can do with technology when

669
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,140
you're actually

670
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:33,240
tracking from the growing the cost of

671
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,400
the seeds the cost of the vegging all

672
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,798
the way until your final product I guess

673
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,100
maybe you don't need to go to flowering

674
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,558
or your final packaging but maybe

675
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:46,439
wholesale like finished finished product

676
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,899
you can see what you want to grow over

677
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,759
time because there is a trade-off there

678
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,640
where if something is

679
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,220
takes you know 30 longer to grow but you

680
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,220
have a 30 higher yield but it actually

681
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,819
only commands a market price it's 40

682
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,440
lower than let's say strain a then you

683
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,619
can make your optimization on what you

684
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:11,278
want to grow depending on what exactly

685
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:13,619
your final value yield is for that

686
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,179
strain and it's something that only a

687
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:17,879
few operators I've seen in California

688
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,519
and really the United States actually

689
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,020
have looked into and you know in the

690
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,579
beginning of these markets margins are

691
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,379
very thick and so people are like yeah

692
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:27,000
let's like grow whatever and sell it and

693
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,278
flip pounds

694
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,099
um But as time goes on and strains

695
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,900
become more accepted and more you know

696
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,658
Common you're going to want to make a

697
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,179
marginal trade-off because that changes

698
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,679
the unit economics of your business

699
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:43,259
significantly like in the millions of

700
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,320
dollars range so uh that's something

701
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:48,658
that I think technology has a pretty

702
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,460
it's a it's an exciting amount of impact

703
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,340
and I think not enough people are

704
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,440
looking at that trade-off especially in

705
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:57,058
the nasian industries like early markets

706
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,460
they start looking at it later when all

707
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:01,740
the margins get crushed but if you look

708
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,319
at it earlier you can you know

709
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,220
completely take advantage of of that

710
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:10,019
market pricing Dynamic okay thank you

711
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,298
there's a question that came in around

712
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,879
crop steering and how technology is

713
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:17,158
going to handle that or Aid crop

714
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,600
steering so first whoever wants to take

715
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,640
this question please go for it but

716
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,339
before we get into it maybe we can

717
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,419
Define what is crop steering

718
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:26,418
does anyone to handle that

719
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,679
I'm not a cultivator

720
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,720
I worked with a lot of cultivators uh in

721
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,200
terms of their crops there are mostly on

722
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,700
the indoor side and that is that's also

723
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,038
kind of interesting to what I mentioned

724
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,000
before but we have a few friends in

725
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,339
California who are like very

726
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,659
sophisticated crop Growers especially in

727
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:47,519
the indoor space where you can change

728
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,820
the humidity you can change the CO2

729
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,798
content the nitrogen content

730
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:55,079
I know several Growers that

731
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,278
actually they'll grow one strain but

732
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,038
they'll sell it under many different

733
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:00,140
skus because the phenotype expression of

734
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,058
the plant

735
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,538
changes on like the tops the mids and

736
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:08,700
the bottom of the buds and so you can

737
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:10,379
start to change the yields of your

738
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,240
plants depending on what

739
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,740
um of the environment you're subjecting

740
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,960
it to and how you're stressing it out

741
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,240
and then you can also change the

742
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,700
phenotype expression so there's a lot of

743
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,000
interesting aspects of I guess crop

744
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,819
steering modification but I would say

745
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,460
not many people really right and is is

746
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:31,379
AI going there yeah is that what's

747
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,120
happening so I'm pointing out a fellow

748
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,220
Tech geek in the crowd he's a smart guy

749
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,239
with this stuff but so that's nice

750
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,778
because

751
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,960
so AI we can rely on AI and

752
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:45,298
link into your crop steering

753
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,919
brain of a computer and that's going to

754
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:49,019
pretty much grow your cannabis for you

755
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,820
with no human interaction

756
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,379
with automated tools I would say

757
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:54,839
eventually yeah that's that's where

758
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,360
you're getting to because

759
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,639
the unfortunate thing is that many times

760
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,740
the Growers look at growing as an art

761
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,880
form and I think that's because of the

762
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,880
tradition is that unfortunate

763
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:10,980
honestly I would say for the future of

764
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,778
humanity it is unfortunate how

765
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,400
because if we're ever going to optimize

766
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,558
things we have to look at more in a

767
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,059
sophisticated repeatable fashion and in

768
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,220
a scientific way because if you're

769
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:23,398
looking at it as an art form it's not

770
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,679
repeatable art by itself subjective art

771
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:27,058
is an expression so cannabis always be a

772
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,399
repeatable thing

773
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:33,058
it's food

774
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:34,798
right but I mean apples are different

775
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:36,898
everywhere you get a different Apple in

776
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:40,079
Arkansas than you do in California than

777
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:41,099
you do in Spain than you do in yeah if I

778
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,500
could jump I mean I'm not really trying

779
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,719
to get super deep into it but no no I'm

780
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,038
sorry one of the things that that I've

781
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,960
been noticing in the past couple of

782
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,058
conferences and I love science and I'm

783
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,740
not denigrating in the science and I

784
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:54,658
understand that you want to be

785
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,140
consistent and repeatable at all times

786
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:02,419
but plants don't work like that

787
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,419
I would I would argue that

788
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,440
Garden at home I do and you'd use the

789
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,778
same techniques all the time for all

790
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,659
your things

791
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:17,880
as well my garden is not as well defined

792
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:20,820
of an environment as I would like for me

793
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,700
to create a repeatable fashion but if

794
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,579
we're going to aggressively service the

795
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,840
Cannabis Market in a sophisticated way

796
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,519
then you're gonna have to control all

797
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,158
those variables that's controlling the

798
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,079
genetics that's controlling the inputs

799
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,299
that's controlling the environment but

800
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,418
it's also how you end up with only one

801
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:41,879
sort of banana and it's dying out

802
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,620
yeah but you also have the most amount

803
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,278
of surplus food production in the world

804
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:48,959
that Humanity has ever seen

805
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,339
so okay I just put it out there so we

806
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,100
can talk about it I mean I do love

807
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:55,379
boutique cannabis it's great like I I've

808
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:56,879
seen I mean can it all be booty cannabis

809
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,278
I mean there's not that many people we

810
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,720
can grow a lot of weed

811
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:02,398
I mean you can but that's not really

812
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,778
like a scalable thing right you're not

813
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,359
going to be able to service the world's

814
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:09,659
cannabis needs and destroy a black

815
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,839
market that corrodes the fabric

816
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,840
foreign

817
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,339
you don't need to destroy the black

818
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,558
market you can co-op the black market

819
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:20,879
right hire some hippies get some Growers

820
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,158
who know what they're doing they'd be on

821
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,500
your squad oh I mean right okay I want

822
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,840
the black market too secondly California

823
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,819
has supplied damn near all near all of

824
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,918
the United States for decades and

825
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:33,898
decades before legalization happens so I

826
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,278
don't think that it's a scalable like

827
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:36,479
it's a problem of scale or it's a

828
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,460
problem if we won't be able to grow

829
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,440
enough weed if we don't use computers or

830
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,640
make everything exactly right some of

831
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,440
the challenges that I'm having with some

832
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,120
of this newfangled weed is it tastes

833
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,340
horrible

834
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,199
okay it tastes like computers I know

835
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:50,220
we're kind of off topic and I'd love to

836
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,240
talk to you about this a little later I

837
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,679
know we're running out of time please

838
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,419
continue I'm sorry do you want to be in

839
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,320
a profitable business or an unprofitable

840
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,240
business

841
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,278
and I think that's the decision you have

842
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,179
to be in

843
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,579
cannabis has been the most profitable

844
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:05,278
decentralized business for decades

845
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:06,599
okay in an unregulated Market yeah

846
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,179
that's the thing it's on when it's

847
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:10,980
unregulated like I could play Monopoly

848
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,740
with no rules right

849
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,659
I love playing Monopoly no rules

850
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,419
I always win

851
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,419
um okay are we almost done uh all right

852
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,399
guys you know we got 90 seconds left

853
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,900
um any random questions from the

854
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:25,199
audience

855
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,360
[Music]

856
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,058
yeah please

857
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:33,058
I'll be quick Eric Berlin from Dentons

858
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:35,639
and regardless of any representation

859
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:37,859
that we have our actions against you uh

860
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,778
what you're doing is amazing uh and I

861
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,639
can say from the perspective of someone

862
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:44,220
who's worked at the state level now

863
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,679
Federal level for legalization we would

864
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,380
not have gotten as far as we've gotten

865
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,659
without vaporization uh because of the

866
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,539
stigma of the spell and the access to

867
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,720
the product so I thank you for that and

868
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:59,759
my question is and those I think are

869
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,440
radical changes that have changed the

870
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,379
whole Marketplace even though I know

871
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,360
everyone here likes smoking weed

872
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,760
um the fact that we could legislate on

873
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,740
on without that was really helpful so

874
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,298
where do you see it 10 years from now I

875
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,278
know we have little time but like what's

876
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:16,798
the change how are we going to be

877
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,898
growing cannabis or using cannabis in 10

878
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,759
years that maybe not everyone here is

879
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:21,479
picturing

880
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:23,519
um

881
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,278
have it hooked up directly to your HVAC

882
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,859
no hitting I don't know

883
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:31,200
yeah um well I believe in 10 years we

884
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:34,798
still will uh partially smoke weed and a

885
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,298
lot of it will be vaporized a weed and

886
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,480
thank you for the comment yeah it's true

887
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:41,278
uh if you receive today a jar of dried

888
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,360
flowers you don't know as a patient at

889
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,339
least you don't know what to do with

890
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,918
this you can do a roller joint but it's

891
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:49,259
not an acceptable medical application

892
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,259
you can make a cookie a tea but if only

893
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:54,419
the only validated version how to

894
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:56,038
applicate it is by vaporization by a

895
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,659
medical device

896
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:59,158
wonderful

897
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:00,720
yeah I think we're out of time all right

898
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,799
guys look hey that was great thank you

899
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,298
though sorry go ahead what are you gonna

900
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:05,339
say Chris is going to say thank you oh

901
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:07,558
sorry I just have a very quick question

902
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:10,500
are you definitely going to extend your

903
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:13,139
license for the medic multimedic and for

904
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,940
the volcano in 2024.

905
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,399
because I'm worried that the medical

906
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,500
market for flower will be otherwise dead

907
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:20,579
if you don't have a vaporizer to

908
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,858
prescribe

909
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,480
yeah you may you refer to the deadline

910
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:26,159
of the medical device regulation in

911
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,679
newborn of course we are working in it

912
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,440
and we will remain in the market with

913
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,480
medical device uh yeah so as you said

914
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,940
it's absolutely necessary to have this

915
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,559
option available and install some

916
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,780
vehicle is still the only one who is

917
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:41,699
providing it

918
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,080
one thank you very much it's here for

919
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,299
the panel that was

920
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,299
I appreciate you and uh
