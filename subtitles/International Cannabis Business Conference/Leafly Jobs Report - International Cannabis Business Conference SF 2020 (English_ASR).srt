1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
good morning everybody I am Bruce Barca

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:09,539
and I am a senior editor at Leafly

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,539
Leafly is a company in the cannabis

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:16,469
industry and I get up every morning

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:18,929
every day and take the bus I take the

6
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,899
ferry and then I ride a bicycle into the

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:25,170
office at Leafly I go there I sit at my

8
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:28,559
desk I sign articles I edit articles I

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,130
talk with colleagues we make plans we do

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,070
all these things and every two weeks

11
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:37,530
Leafly sends me a check

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,899
what Leafly and I have is not a mutually

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,799
agreeable arrangement it is called

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:47,759
employment I go to Leafly because it is

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:50,308
my job that's one job my colleague David

16
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,349
downs back there he also goes to Leafly

17
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,808
he often gets there earlier than I do in

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,210
the morning that's two of us we just

19
00:00:54,808 --> 00:01:00,448
heard from Alex Rebecca

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,890
Jared Ruben and Tara they two are more

21
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,500
or less in the cannabis industry now

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,960
we're up to seven and Gaea I'm counting

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,700
you that's a you could make it without

24
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,789
the legal cannabis industry but we're

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,010
gonna count you in there um here's the

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,450
thing I did a rough count of the room

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,659
here we've got about a hundred people

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,280
more or less we're probably all in the

29
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:26,070
cannabis industry or want to be in the

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,710
cannabis industry here's the thing the

31
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:35,069
federal government does not believe we

32
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:39,239
exist they don't count our jobs I'm here

33
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:42,289
to tell you we do exist and Leafly we

34
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:45,539
make sure that those jobs are counted

35
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,759
our annual cannabis jobs count we do

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,790
this every year and it started about

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,799
four years ago when we asked a freelance

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,990
journalist he had a great business

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,969
background to go out there and nail down

40
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,739
the number we said look there's a lot of

41
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:01,589
talk about how many jobs are supported

42
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,739
by legal cannabis there's there are

43
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,090
varying numbers very vague numbers go

44
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,269
out there and just just bring us back

45
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,610
the number right so it goes out does a

46
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,390
lot of research talks to people talk to

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,850
labor economist talks to the

48
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:18,549
Bureau of Labor Statistics comes back

49
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:22,389
after four weeks and says there's no

50
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,370
number nobody has a number and the

51
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:25,809
reason nobody has a number we said wait

52
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,750
wait there's got to be a number like we

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:34,199
exist you exist and he said no no

54
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:36,430
there's no number because there's no

55
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,189
recognition by the federal government

56
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,760
obviously federal prohibition is is in

57
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,789
in force right now and most state

58
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:49,840
economists take their cue in terms of

59
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:51,759
how they tally jobs from the Federal

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,979
Bureau of Labor Statistics well the

61
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,289
Bureau of Labor Statistics won't touch

62
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,250
cannabis obviously but there's something

63
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:01,179
more than that

64
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:04,590
it's that marijuana jobs actually don't

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,489
exist in the classification system for

66
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,409
tallying jobs and there's something

67
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,209
called the NAICS system I've got it up

68
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,150
here North American industry

69
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:17,099
classification system so every job has a

70
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:21,459
number you'll see here if you type in

71
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:25,590
marijuana or cannabis in the last couple

72
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:28,360
of years you got no results zero so

73
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,209
people complained about this and the

74
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,950
folks who keep track of the NAICS said

75
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,530
okay okay we hear you we see you

76
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:37,719
actually exist you have jobs we're gonna

77
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,430
add you to the system and everybody

78
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,810
thought oh okay great you know we're

79
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,269
finally there we're finally in the

80
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,530
system well there's a problem with that

81
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:50,340
and here here's the problem

82
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,739
marijuana retail is now lumped in with

83
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,909
27 other jobs as you can see here let me

84
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,860
show you here we are

85
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:59,439
marijuana retail marijuana stores

86
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,650
recreational or retail we're in there

87
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,519
with beer making supply stores binocular

88
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,250
stores calendar shops candle shops

89
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,469
closet organizer stores and hot tub

90
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,139
supply stores we all have the same

91
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:16,509
number us and aqua quip we're all

92
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,668
they're in there together so no matter

93
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:21,939
how many jobs we add there's no real way

94
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:23,339
to tell that we're adding them or if the

95
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,660
binocular stores

96
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:29,789
adding them or if there's some new

97
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,710
American Renaissance in hot tubs farmers

98
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,290
are in the same position there is

99
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,959
actually a farmer a cannabis grower

100
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,180
number but they're in there with mint

101
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,539
farmers with hop growers this sort of

102
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,610
thing so we decided to take a look at

103
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,460
the data that existed because every

104
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,710
state reports something on legal

105
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:52,469
cannabis whether it's a patient count or

106
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:55,500
its number of licensed retailers or

107
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,610
maybe it's weekly sales monthly sales

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:03,110
the state of Florida actually reports

109
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,189
ounces of cannabis leaf sold per week

110
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,189
that's that's what they they don't

111
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:10,410
report retail sales they report ounces

112
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:13,379
sold per week weird stuff as out is out

113
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,680
there the state of Arizona reports by I

114
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:19,409
think number of pounds sold per month

115
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,780
there's weird data out there but we used

116
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,970
a number of existing reports and work

117
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:27,659
with some economists who work with

118
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,550
cannabis and and labor data and we came

119
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,860
up kind of with a with a system that

120
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:36,300
allows us to take that existing data and

121
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,750
turn it into estimates of full-time

122
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,569
equivalent jobs per state and we do this

123
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,310
every year we start in December we run

124
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,569
through December in January it takes

125
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,019
about two months to put it all together

126
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:51,209
and this year's number is two hundred

127
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,839
forty three thousand seven hundred

128
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:57,689
full-time American jobs that's nearly a

129
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:02,038
quarter of a million Americans whose

130
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:10,620
jobs depend on legal cannabis that's a

131
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:12,269
very politically powerful number here's

132
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,689
how it here's how those numbers have

133
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,909
grown over the years twenty seventeen we

134
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,250
counted one hundred twenty two thousand

135
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,310
eight hundred jobs one forty nine in

136
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,680
2018 two hundred eleven thousand in 2019

137
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,348
and two hundred forty three thousand

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,180
seven hundred in early 2020 and if

139
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:33,870
you'll notice we're basically adding

140
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,040
jobs at a twenty thousand a year 40,000

141
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,470
a year 60,000 a year clip

142
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,950
and this really is you you've got to

143
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,630
know that this is unique in America no

144
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:48,029
other industry is doing this right now

145
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:48,029
like the cannabis industry is doing it

146
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:01,209
sorry guys can you click forward here

147
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,550
I'm night there we go and we're doing it

148
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:05,469
you know we've heard this morning about

149
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,680
the tough times in the cannabis industry

150
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:11,140
and it's it's it's no secret a lot of

151
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,769
major companies have undergone layoffs

152
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,319
including my own we went through the Bay

153
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:19,959
P lung crisis over the last six months

154
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,209
vape sales are down we're going through

155
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,939
a lot of turmoil right now but in that

156
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:27,339
turmoil and within you know companies

157
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:29,529
laying off hundreds of workers we saw

158
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:31,989
aurora up in Canada just laid off 500

159
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:36,549
workers this week within that

160
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:40,269
environment quietly the engine of

161
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:44,379
cannabis is growing jobs over the last

162
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:47,829
year growing jobs at a 33,000 jobs per

163
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:50,290
year clip which is again a remarkable

164
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:52,870
story for us to tell here's how those

165
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,860
jobs compared to other jobs I don't want

166
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,870
to point out the top three job jobs

167
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,910
there that I listed I listed for a

168
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,649
reason I listed them because they are

169
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,420
very politically powerful symbolic jobs

170
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,789
there may not be a more politically

171
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,680
powerful job in America than coal mining

172
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:15,280
as we saw in the last election

173
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,970
coal miners only 52,000 jobs rely on

174
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,909
coal mining in America that's it 52,000

175
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,150
logging the Pacific Northwest logging is

176
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,830
a hugely politically important job

177
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:29,379
72,000 people textile manufacturing

178
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:35,348
especially in the American South 73,000

179
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:39,580
people legal cannabis 243 thousand seven

180
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,680
hundred jobs these jobs matter and one

181
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,350
of the reasons we do this count again is

182
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,449
to spread the message make these jobs

183
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,490
politically powerful our jobs are out

184
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,660
there and they're worth defending

185
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,769
where did that job growth come from in

186
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:57,929
the last year we saw most of it in

187
00:08:54,769 --> 00:09:00,360
Massachusetts where their adult use

188
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:03,179
legal market really hit its stride in

189
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,110
the past year added we estimated more

190
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,859
than ten thousand jobs in the past year

191
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:15,409
Oklahoma and they'd be been to Oklahoma

192
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:21,089
right Oklahoma is going nuts its

193
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:23,669
Oklahoma now has more than 5% of the

194
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:26,339
population with a medical marijuana card

195
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:29,610
more than five percent of Oklahoma

196
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:31,830
residents now have a med card and that

197
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,129
results in more than seven thousand jobs

198
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,350
added in the past year Illinois its

199
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:40,289
medical market grew to such an extent

200
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,379
that six thousand jobs were added in the

201
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:45,809
last year we just saw it grow open its

202
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:48,289
met its adult use market forty million

203
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:50,909
dollars in sales in just the first month

204
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:53,579
Florida we saw about ninety three

205
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:56,939
percent year-over-year growth in sales

206
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,280
in that state thanks especially to the

207
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,580
first time introduction of smokeable

208
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,980
flower introduced in their dispensaries

209
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,970
here's what we see in terms of the top

210
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:12,060
ten employers around the country

211
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,730
California obviously is still by far the

212
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:18,599
has the most workers but look at how

213
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,789
close Colorado is I mean the 5,000

214
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,860
worker difference here's the thing and

215
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:26,279
David downs may speak to this this a

216
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:29,100
little bit after me California because

217
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:33,750
of the sunsetting of its collectives law

218
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:36,659
in 2019 a lot of jobs that existed in

219
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,089
the legal space went into the non legal

220
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,699
space so we actually had to Ratchet back

221
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:45,060
our estimate for legal jobs in

222
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,070
California by about eight thousand we

223
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:50,879
had to do something similar in Michigan

224
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,650
where new tight regulations came in to a

225
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,620
market that was completely unregulated

226
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:58,289
prior to that and we ratcheted back by

227
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,029
about probably 7,000 jobs in the state

228
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,990
of Michigan now we expect those jobs to

229
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,819
eventually come back

230
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,028
more stores are licensed as more

231
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,879
municipalities allow stores to open in

232
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:11,470
their region but it's a it's a really

233
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,500
interesting thing I mean if California

234
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,160
and Michigan had not lost those jobs

235
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,169
instead of a 15 percent gain in 2019 we

236
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,179
would have seen about a 23 percent gain

237
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:26,278
so those two states accounted for a lot

238
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:29,229
of a lot of lost jobs there's another

239
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:33,179
thing I want to a couple states I want

240
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,769
to point out and draw some attention to

241
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,439
Massachusetts we saw more than 300%

242
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:41,278
growth over the last year they're

243
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,410
supporting now about 13,000 legal jobs

244
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,958
but Massachusetts like a handful of

245
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:50,139
other states there is still a massive

246
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:54,099
amount of opportunity in Massachusetts

247
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:56,409
Massachusetts has what 13,000 legal jobs

248
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,629
there are about 7 million people in

249
00:11:56,409 --> 00:12:00,069
Massachusetts there are about 7 million

250
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:03,789
people in the state of Washington

251
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:07,750
Washington now supports about 23,000

252
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:10,088
jobs or so so we see Massachusetts in

253
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,480
that market as being basically just

254
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:17,620
maybe half of what it could be there are

255
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,990
I would say there are the number of open

256
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,769
shops in Massachusetts kind of is in the

257
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,959
dozens

258
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,649
whereas in Washington State we have more

259
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,958
than 300 licensed and open shops and so

260
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:31,019
we expect the Massachusetts to keep on

261
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,149
growing in the next year or two

262
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,759
Oklahoma again just an absolutely

263
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:39,039
incredible boom especially in a state

264
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,049
that is so culturally and politically

265
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,379
conservative there are a lot of

266
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:46,629
activists out there in other states

267
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:48,458
looking at Oklahoma and taking a lot of

268
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,769
inspiration from what they see there

269
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,359
there are folks in working in Idaho I

270
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,439
know radical Russ Belleville is out

271
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,610
there trying to get a medical marijuana

272
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,500
bill on the ballot in Idaho and folks in

273
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,509
other more conservative states are

274
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,059
looking at Oklahoma and saying oh my god

275
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:06,819
if they can do it in Oklahoma we can do

276
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:10,000
it in our state to Florida

277
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:14,379
Florida has more than 300,000 registered

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,089
medical marijuana patients they saw 93%

279
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:19,088
growth over the past year

280
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:21,279
they're selling I think 19,000 was the

281
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,449
number about four weeks ago I just

282
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,458
checked I think they're up to about

283
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:27,998
twenty one thousand twenty two thousand

284
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:32,258
ounces of smokeable flour sold every

285
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:34,649
week now in Florida Colorado in

286
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,089
Washington this number surprised us

287
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:39,308
because we thought of Colorado and

288
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,360
Washington is very mature markets who

289
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:42,429
would sort of Plateau

290
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,180
you know after what have they been in

291
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:48,370
business now six six full years but we

292
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:51,458
saw eight percent growth in each of

293
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,709
those states it's it's pretty incredible

294
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:56,498
and a couple things we thought were

295
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:59,979
going on one was that just simply the

296
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:02,470
slow eventual movement of people from

297
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,899
the illicit market to the legal market

298
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:09,069
is going on but then also anecdotally

299
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,480
basically because you know Leafly is in

300
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:13,419
Washington State and we see this

301
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,808
ourselves what we're seeing are a number

302
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:19,448
of consumers who are outside like the

303
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:22,269
classic marijuana consumer demographic

304
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:24,159
coming into the space they're coming

305
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,659
into legal stores for the first time

306
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,948
because those stores have been there for

307
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:28,178
a while their neighbors are shopping

308
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:30,818
there they're feeling more comfortable

309
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:34,269
about coming in but more than the stores

310
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:36,878
they're finding products that suit their

311
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:39,938
lifestyles and their health regimens I

312
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,339
know a number of people who never well

313
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:44,588
maybe not never smoked marijuana but

314
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,230
smoking was not a part of their of their

315
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,990
life but now they've discovered a five

316
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,178
milligram mint or they've discovered a

317
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,980
10 milligram gummy and that does work

318
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:55,480
for them that does help them relax at

319
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,688
the end of a long day that does help

320
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,428
them you know enjoy a movie on Netflix

321
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:02,498
and they feel more in control and it's

322
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:05,259
very discrete they can keep it in their

323
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:09,129
pocket or in their backpack it doesn't

324
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:11,199
smell so I think the the the evolution

325
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:14,350
of cannabis products has really helped

326
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,269
to bring in a number of people into

327
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:20,139
these mature markets we had just this

328
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:23,678
past week we put up an article on leaf

329
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:24,879
Lee called Kali sober what is it why are

330
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:26,740
people doing this right

331
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,860
well Kali sober is essentially the idea

332
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,360
that

333
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:34,490
you're essentially leaving alcohol but

334
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,889
you're not leaving all substances you're

335
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,509
leaving alcohol choosing not to drink

336
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:42,139
but maybe you're mixing a little

337
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:44,929
cannabis in here and there and that

338
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:46,549
article absolutely took off for us we

339
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:47,750
just saw click click click click click

340
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:49,969
click click click click

341
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,828
I mean it's January new year new you or

342
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,070
I guess it's February now but new year

343
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:56,778
new you right but that was that was sort

344
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,959
of eye-opening for us like wow there's a

345
00:15:56,778 --> 00:16:02,750
lot of people interested in this concept

346
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:06,768
of you know mixing in cannabis in a way

347
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:09,200
that is healthy and suits them and maybe

348
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,578
help them help them put down the drink

349
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,028
or the bottle a little bit I know that's

350
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:15,679
that's happened for me in my life a few

351
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:19,250
states to watch that we're looking at in

352
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:22,879
2020 the Great Lakes region all of these

353
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,379
states are pretty amazing they're to us

354
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,639
here on the west coast I think maybe a

355
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:31,789
little quiet but Ohio you know now we

356
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,899
estimate has about 4200 jobs saw two

357
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:35,809
hundred seventy three percent

358
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:38,480
year-over-year sales growth the two

359
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:41,629
seventy three percent doesn't match the

360
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,209
job growth there's a little bit of math

361
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:48,320
involved here because the year-over-year

362
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:52,069
is capturing but the sales actually in

363
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,709
2019 but the jobs number is based on

364
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,940
where the market is now in January 2020

365
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:59,328
in other words maybe they sold 10

366
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:01,760
million in January of 2019 and 60

367
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:04,279
million in January or December of 2019

368
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,088
so the market really is at that 60

369
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:12,410
million a month a month figure Illinois

370
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:15,139
again a huge market already but a lot of

371
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,150
opportunity there Illinois is in a

372
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,640
situation where they just opened their

373
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,189
adult you stores selling 40 million

374
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,049
dollars a month if that keeps on and we

375
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,579
expect it to keep on you know that's a

376
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:29,918
four hundred and eighty million dollar a

377
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:33,470
year market Illinois has a chance to

378
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,220
sort of enjoy a bit of the Colorado

379
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:40,549
effect and what I mean by that is

380
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,329
Colorado when it opened in 2014 because

381
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,839
of its central

382
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:47,480
location it drew people from around the

383
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:49,730
country who wanted to experience a legal

384
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,380
cannabis store for the first time we saw

385
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,599
people driving up from Texas we saw

386
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,909
people coming in from all over the

387
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,398
country and they were going to Colorado

388
00:17:55,909 --> 00:18:00,080
instead of Washington because I live in

389
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:02,119
Washington I love the state but we're a

390
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,398
little far out there you know it takes

391
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,959
it takes a while to get there

392
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:09,168
Illinois has a similarly central

393
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,558
location it's surrounded by five

394
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:15,320
prohibition states five and those stores

395
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,190
on the Illinois border are doing very

396
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,750
very well

397
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,600
and they're going to continue to do well

398
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:24,109
as more visitors go up to Illinois to

399
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,668
experience what we've got Pennsylvania

400
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:28,699
another kind of quiet state this year

401
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:31,399
they really bloomed in 2018 but again

402
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,159
they're continuing to grow their medical

403
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:38,178
system over there here's where I get up

404
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:41,809
on my soapbox and bring out a call to

405
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:44,419
action and ask you to take this number

406
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:48,648
take your state's number and do

407
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:52,009
something with it again the coal mining

408
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:55,038
industry hugely powerful timber in the

409
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:57,169
northwest hugely powerful I'd like to

410
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,089
see us in the cannabis industry come out

411
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,639
and as one of our panelists mentioned

412
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:03,528
here before be proud of the fact that

413
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:05,388
you work in this industry let people

414
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:08,419
know let people know there are others in

415
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:10,428
this industry I live in a congressional

416
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:13,700
district that's not in Seattle it's

417
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:15,919
across the water in Kitsap County and my

418
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:20,090
congressman is the gentleman named Erik

419
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,519
Kilmer Derek Kilmer represents my

420
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:24,829
district which has Bremerton which has a

421
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,880
Naval Shipyard they're the Naval

422
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:31,129
Shipyard jobs in Bremerton are

423
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,789
sacrosanct to that region like they are

424
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:37,429
they symbolize employment and good jobs

425
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:40,819
for a lot of people so when federal

426
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:41,509
budgets come out and those jobs are put

427
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:44,089
at risk

428
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:46,970
Derek Kilmer steps up he holds press

429
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:50,240
conferences he holds he leads protests

430
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,759
and he defends those jobs very publicly

431
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,829
now what I like to do is I like to

432
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,039
contact Derek Kilmer or his staff every

433
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:57,169
