1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,410
thank you so much in Gayo appreciate the

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,349
introduction but as anybody knows that

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,620
works in politics it takes so many

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:18,000
people to change the law and as we are

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:21,059
progressing state-by-state now nation by

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,778
nation it takes a team of people it

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:28,919
takes educating people it takes bringing

8
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:30,660
people who opposed us into our side you

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,039
know letting them see the light whether

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,090
it's because of political reasons

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,829
financial reasons moral reasons and as

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,440
people in California found as we

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,200
definitely know in Oregon you can have a

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:47,000
great law great program produce great

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,899
cannabis but there are so many issues

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,920
taxes banking exports potentially that

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,620
require federal action and that's what

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,129
this panel is about cannabis and the

19
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:04,908
feds we are really reaching a tipping

20
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:08,368
point where we can see bipartisan

21
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:11,640
efforts to end prohibition at the

22
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,200
federal level and these are folks here

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,960
joining me on the stage that are helping

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,950
make that happen I will kick it off down

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,769
the line for them to introduce

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,750
themselves but first I do want to give a

27
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,879
little introduction to Neal Levine and

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,540

33

35
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,109

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,920
back in 2003 and so the man has been

37
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,989
putting in putting in the work to move

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,820

44

is Neal Levine I am the CEO the cannabis

45
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,250
trade federation we are we're kind of a

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,959
start-up we've only been around for

47
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,189
about seven months but we have some of

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,680
the

49
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:16,289
largest players and a diversity of

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,540
businesses both jack

51
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,919
through geographic location and by

52
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,099
business type throughout the country

53
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,899
we're coming together to pull together

54
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:27,389
an aligned federation of organizations

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,069
to really give us a representation that

56
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:35,789
we need in DC and to give us the to end

57
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,979
prohibition are our number one focus in

58
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:40,289
this Congress in 116th Congress is the

59
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,780
states act and the states act basically

60
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,729
what it says is if you are not in

61
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,099
violation of state law you're not in

62
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,719
violation of federal law the real world

63
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,189
impact of what the states Act would do

64
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,469
it ends to a de penalty taxation the

65
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:59,909
states Act would open up real commercial

66
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:02,069
banking services and the states Act

67
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,810
would permanently end the threat of the

68
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,759
Department of Justice kicking in our

69
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,509
doors for the crime of running a state

70
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,819
legal and compliant business so and we

71
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:15,120
think that we have a real opportunity to

72
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,889
pass that into law this Congress the

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,439
president has said he would sign it if

74
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:23,879
it reaches his desk we have bipartisan

75
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,439
sponsors on both sides senator Cory

76
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,469
Gardner is the lead sponsor in the

77
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,449
Senate with Elizabeth Warren Earl bloom

78
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:33,479
and our is the lead sponsor in the house

79
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:35,280
with representative David Joyce and we

80
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,739
are building from there so very happy to

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,539
be here thank you very much and with

82
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,659
that I will kick it down to our esteemed

83
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,939
panel so look as anthony said i've been

84
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:47,009
i've been doing this for 16 17 years now

85
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,900
and what's really really exciting is

86
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,090
we've all been talking about when is it

87
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,550
gonna end when is the federal-state

88
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,110
conflict going to end well here are some

89
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,700
folks that are actively working on it

90
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,410
and i believe that these are the folks

91
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,489
that are actually going to have it end

92
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,680
this year

93
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,790
so with that Melissa thank you

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,560
well good morning everyone my name is

95
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,929
Melissa Kuiper's Blake I'm a partner

96
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,759
with Brownstein Hyatt and Barbara Shrek

97
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,349
I've been lobbying for 20-plus years

98
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,560
started at the state level in

99
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:18,298
Tallahassee in Florida in 1996 and have

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,798
grown that practice into state lobbying

101
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,168
throughout the country and federal

102
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,879
lobbying in Washington DC I couldn't be

103
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:24,810
prouder to represent the cannabis trade

104
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,310
federation and be

105
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,870
working on this incredible legislation

106
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,639
with Neil and his team

107
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,189
Emile's right we have a real opportunity

108
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,829
in this Congress between the bipartisan

109
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,899
approach the states rights approach how

110
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:38,250
things are gonna get addressed I think

111
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,870
we'll talk a little bit about substance

112
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,160
more here in a second but with that I'll

113
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,800
turn it over to my colleagues on the

114
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,370
stage to introduce themselves thanks

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,569
Melissa

116
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:52,050
my name is Andrew Shore I spent about 15

117
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,819
years on Capitol Hill ending my career

118
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,250
as the chief of staff at the House

119
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,189
Republican Conference spend a lot of my

120
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,069
time working on issues that I frankly

121
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:04,978
believe Republicans should embrace such

122
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:06,689
as cannabis and the free market that

123
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,409
that you all have brought into this

124
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:10,910
industry

125
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,800
I run a boutique law lobbying firm and

126
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,570
we are really really excited to work

127
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,710
with the cannabis trade federation to

128
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:21,899
pass the state's act and help all of you

129
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:23,519
run legal compliant businesses in the

130
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,109
light of day that's exactly how it

131
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,329
should work that's not a Republican

132
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:33,210
principle not a Democrat principle it's

133
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:35,819
an American principle thank you thank

134
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:37,560
you so much my name is Nadine Masami

135
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,899
I've actually been working on these

136
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,668
issues for quite a long time because for

137
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,788
the past ten and a half years until I

138
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:46,769
retired from Congress I was Nancy Pelosi

139
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:49,349
communications director and chief of

140
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:52,199
staff I left Congress about a year and a

141
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,150
half ago and this is a very important

142
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,969
issue we feel that there's an

143
00:05:54,149 --> 00:06:00,839
opportunity that has grown growing this

144
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:03,300
this year this is the time it took a lot

145
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,388
of Education but now we feel that the

146
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,870
that the chances is before us and I look

147
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,978
forward to discussing this some more so

148
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,530
if you guys could grab a couple of those

149
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:15,079
mics so we can just have kind of one

150
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:17,309
person without and share them around

151
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,639
before we get into the hard question

152
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,009
let's start I know stuff let's start

153
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,210
with optimistic reasons and Neil you can

154
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,399
take this or somebody else can take it

155
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:29,099
off you want what are kind of the

156
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,409
factors that you see both in DC and

157
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,150
across the country like why do you feel

158
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,189
like this could be the year why are we

159
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:38,009
at a tipping point at this time at

160
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:40,529
Congress prohibition is untenable

161
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,269
we have 33 states plus the District of

162
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,949
Columbia has opted out of prohibition in

163
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:46,049
some form we have ten states plus the

164
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,139
District that have opted out entirely

165
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,069
the Canadian markets are up in roaring

166
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,860
Mexico is about to set up their own

167
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,740
markets we see South America European

168
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,410
countries now Asia in the Middle East

169
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,389
all starting to move towards the end of

170
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,850
prohibition where you're seating which

171
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,740
should be in American industry for no

172
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,590
other reason except for bad policy

173
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,900
there's no basis in science we are an

174
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:13,019
industry that has hundreds of thousands

175
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:15,569
of employees today working directly for

176
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,490
the industry or supplying the industry

177
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,370
we are here fighting for hundreds of

178
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,840
thousands of people's mortgages hundreds

179
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,990
of thousands of families health

180
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,959
insurance and it is untenable the the

181
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,650
idea that you could go to federal prison

182
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,449
for doing your job well you get that you

183
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:36,689
are legally allowed to do under state

184
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:40,019
law is one of the most unamerican things

185
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,339
that I could possibly think of and the

186
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,129
states have spoken the people have

187
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,839
spoken the polling is through the roof

188
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,060
we are now supermajority for

189
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,399
legalization nationwide and then when

190
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,079
you ask well regardless of how you feel

191
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,339
about cannabis how do you if a state

192
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,800
passes a law should the federal

193
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,029
government come in and interfere

194
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,090
seventy-five percent of Americans say no

195
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:04,649
so the idea of leave letting the having

196
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,599
the federal government step out and

197
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,419
allowing the states to continue to do

198
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,250
this pulls 10% higher than ending

199
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,199
prohibition and ending prohibition polls

200
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,240
at a supermajority so it's become

201
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,629
completely untenable it makes no sense

202
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,120
and it's time for this to end and the

203
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,939
combination of the polling of the states

204
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,160
moving of outside pressures is what has

205
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,529
brought us to this place where we have

206
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,060
to do it we have to do it now and we've

207
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,349
done a lot of work on the states the

208
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,340
states are going to continue to open up

209
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:38,450
markets Congress must act it is time for

210
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,450
Congress to act

211
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,549
and I imagine it has to do with a lot of

212
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:49,028
the factors that Neil mentioned but as

213
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:53,109
you speak to people in Washington DC are

214
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:55,688
you are you hearing different things

215
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,959
from them are you do you have like any

216
00:08:55,688 --> 00:09:00,159
stories may not be able to publicly read

217
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:05,169
the name became share some stories about

218
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,879
I mean to follow on what Neil's saying

219
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,799
the reason that's that you're seeing a

220
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,688
lot more Republicans get engaged in this

221
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,909
issue is because the upward pressure

222
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:14,620
from their state legislatures when

223
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:17,469
you've got states like Georgia Arkansas

224
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,028
Oklahoma you know any bright

225
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,699
right-leaning Center right-leaning

226
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:24,338
states and the legislators are calling

227
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:25,778
those members who many of them served

228
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,339
with you know before they went to

229
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:29,198
Congress they were in this State House

230
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,600
or the state Senate and they say look

231
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:34,059
we've passed this bill and it can be

232
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,519
just CBD it can be medical you know

233
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,679
whatever they call their their member of

234
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,970
Congress or their they see them back in

235
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,578
the state capitol and they say look

236
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,500
we've done the work you say you're for

237
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:47,078
states rights you know you went to

238
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,419
Washington you said you would support a

239
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,758
states rights agenda well here is your

240
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:54,818
chance to support a states right agenda

241
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,370
yeah embrace what we've done allow us to

242
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:59,229
be the incubators of this industry that

243
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,720
we said we were and I think it's very

244
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,879
simple that that message is getting

245
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,220
through loud and clear and we're hearing

246
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,259
that time and time again that members

247
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,269
you know they want to be consistent in

248
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:16,058
their views and the the people have not

249
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:17,948
just only spoken but they've acted my

250
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:19,480
primary responsibility on behalf of the

251
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:21,490
states Act is the Senate Republican

252
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,319
caucus which you can imagine is an

253
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,000
uphill climb and a lot of conversations

254
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:27,009
on this issue and really we're kind of a

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,528
negotiation and the real pressure is

256
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:30,909
going to be and Andrews absolutely right

257
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,470
you know the first question is what is

258
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:35,049
my state done in one of my citizens

259
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,000
decided and the good news is to Neil's

260
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:39,159
point a lot of the answers on that or

261
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,808
yes our legislators either passed it or

262
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,610
ballot measures or look are potentially

263
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,409
gonna be on the ballot or in fact it has

264
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,000
passed we've had opportunities for

265
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,009
example to meet with brand-new members

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,409
of the US Senate whose states just

267
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,178
passed like Utah and Missouri and those

268
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,629
are really game-changing conversations

269
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,769
because we go in with

270
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,600
little bit of an upper hand and the

271
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,789
opportunity to say look not only did it

272
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,009
pass it passed by 10 points surpassed by

273
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:02,899
seven points and that's the big deal and

274
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,330
these members many of whom got elected

275
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,639
by a really narrow margin want to really

276
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,470
listen to what their state wants so it's

277
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,549
been a really interesting dynamic to be

278
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,950
able to talk to them about what's

279
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:14,719
happening back home and yes those are

280
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,210
really the things that we use is our

281
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,170
leverage points in these conversations

282
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,509
you know there's a lot of questions

283
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:22,339
about after States Act what's next and

284
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,950
our responses look States is the first

285
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,750
step we've got to get something done in

286
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,950
federal law in order to open up answers

287
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,570
to always at all of these other

288
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,030
questions about how the industry would

289
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,920
run in a long-term way but really that's

290
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,839
the key right we want the industry to

291
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,089
operate in a long-term sustainable

292
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,480
regulated fashion and States Act is the

293
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,160
first step to that are any of you from

294
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,409
what you would consider a purple or red

295
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,289
state so anyone here from the Midwest

296
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:51,319
you know the the best thing you can do

297
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:53,120
when you go home is to reach out both to

298
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,220
your member of Congress but also to your

299
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,649
state legislature and if you've done

300
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,080
something in the state reinforce that

301
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,850
idea go meet with them and say hey will

302
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,460
you call call our congressmen and

303
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,320
they'll do it they will do it I want to

304
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,670
jump in real quick to piggyback on

305
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:15,110
something Melissa said hey Kristin the

306
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:16,099
the what we're hearing from the left is

307
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,320
very different from what we're hearing

308
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,050
from the right so we're engaged in these

309
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,340
conversations on the right and where we

310
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:27,469
have reframed this to talk in terms of

311
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,330
federalism because if you're a true

312
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,610
constitutionalists and a federalist and

313
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,190
a conservative it's really hard to argue

314
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,169
that we are not the personification of

315
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,580
federalism with 33 states plus a

316
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:39,019
district that have opted out with

317
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,670
different regulations and different laws

318
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,460
and no product that can leave a state

319
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:46,729
boundary that being said what we're

320
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,800
hearing from the left is also incredibly

321
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,840
encouraging and what we're hearing is

322
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,609
that they want a solution that includes

323
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:57,980
restorative justice and social equity

324
00:12:52,610 --> 00:13:00,019
and that that fact that we now have

325
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:04,070
because let's be honest with each other

326
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:05,659
right and I'm a nonpartisan my first

327
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,528
campaign that I ever did 20 years ago is

328
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:11,370
Jesse Ventura for governor

329
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:15,230
it's true and so so I am I'm an honest

330
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:17,879
nonpartisan registered nonpartisan and

331
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,560
the Democrats haven't done anything for

332
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,240
us in large part just like the

333
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,799
Republicans haven't done anything for us

334
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,230
in large part the only thing that the

335
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,449
Congress has done to date is passed an

336
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,820
appropriations rider that puts a

337
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:32,129
restriction on spending DEA resources on

338
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,510
going after medical marijuana licenses

339
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:37,049
in the States who's been incredibly

340
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:39,240
helpful but now that we have leadership

341
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:42,179
in one of the houses of the US Congress

342
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,709
saying that prohibition needs to end

343
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,079
with full expungements and full

344
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:48,509
legalization on the federal level how

345
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,709
amazing is that how amazing that we've

346
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:54,419
gotten to this place so so as Melissa

347
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,879
was saying I don't think there's an

348
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:58,049
appetite for from the Intel that we're

349
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,088
hearing we don't think there's an

350
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:03,028
appetite in the Senate and with the

351
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,490
administration for full D creme on the

352
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:07,649
federal level yet but there is an

353
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,600
appetite for deferring to the states

354
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,179
because while there's a lot of

355
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,639
disagreement of what comes next there's

356
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,679
also growing amount of agreement that

357
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,799
the conflict between federal and state

358
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,870
law needs to end and the first law that

359
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,679
I quarterback personally passed into law

360
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,600
was Vermont 2004 Vermont 2004 medical

361
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,719
marijuana was three plants one mature

362
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,180
three qualifying conditions no industry

363
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,769
fast forward a little over a decade

364
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:38,099
later Vermont becomes the first state

365
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:40,588
legislature to end prohibition you don't

366
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,810
always get the law that you want the

367
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,899
first time out what we need to do is we

368
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:47,309
need to pass the fundamental

369
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:50,578
game-changing piece of legislation that

370
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:52,289
permanently changes the equation in the

371
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:54,929
question on the federal level from

372
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:57,149
should we do this to how should we do

373
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,099
this right and when we get into how

374
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,990
should we do this

375
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,370
CTF we're gonna be side by side where we

376
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,649
think this ends is the end of full

377
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,049
prohibition and full expungements but we

378
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,208
think the states that can pass into law

379
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:12,088
this Congress let me talk briefly about

380
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,769
how Democrats view this in especially in

381
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:15,720
the house this is an issue that they've

382
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,879
been talking about for years however

383
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,889
they're going to be holding hearings

384
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,519
this Congress on various pieces of

385
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,528
legislation

386
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,490
whether it's the finance issue where

387
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:29,338
there's 280e whether it's for HR 420

388
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,919
however what is the art of the possible

389
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,320
and that's how we should view this with

390
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,299
the states act can the states act passed

391
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,570
the house yes but it's gonna require

392
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:42,149
some support from the ground up from you

393
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,430
but also from members from the

394
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,620
Republican side and from members are

395
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:48,958
gonna say look this is what we can do

396
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,240
because we know that this states act it

397
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,549
also passed a second look I view this in

398
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,680
three parts right first part is educate

399
00:15:55,549 --> 00:16:02,009
just like you said call your member of

400
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:07,039
Congress let them know go see him if you

401
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:10,230
can here in the district or go see em in

402
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,449
Washington so you have to add to educate

403
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:18,180
the second is you get a little tough

404
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:24,270
right advocate we want this to be done

405
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:27,419
this Congress and the third is demand so

406
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:29,419
educate advocate demand I'm sure all of

407
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:33,088
you could do this it's not that hard

408
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:36,809
heck we're doing it but it's gonna

409
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:40,410
require the voters to really say this

410
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:43,409
has to get done the other linchpin of

411
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:46,049
our strategy is bipartisanship it is

412
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:49,439
critical that this industry launch

413
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:52,289
itself in Washington as bipartisan you

414
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,570
see time and time again that industries

415
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:56,519
that have thrown in with one party or

416
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:01,620
the other it's a very short-sighted

417
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:04,318
strategy right this regardless of our

418
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,619
personal views you create jobs as Neel

419
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:11,099
likes to say millions of mortgages

420
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,500
health insurance jobs and you know so

421
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,750
maintaining that level bipartisanship as

422
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,420
we move forward on the states act will

423
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,119
really set the stage for you all for a

424
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,600
long and prosperous future soon to be

425
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,969
millions of mortgages very soon yeah and

426
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,789
a Nadine with your experience you know

427
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,120
working with speaker Pelosi I mean it

428
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,668
see

429
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,519
to me kind of Leutnant what Neil said

430
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:39,240
about neither party has like done enough

431
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,190
for the cause that the Democrats have

432
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,419
talked the better game you know and talk

433
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,278
about the appropriations bill they've

434
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,600
they've had more voters vote for it but

435
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:48,000
they haven't been in the majority now

436
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,369
they're in the House Majority and to me

437
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,669
for a lot of progressives I feel like

438
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:55,769
it's put up or shut up time and that the

439
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,470
Democrats will pay a price at the ballot

440
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,179
box if they don't pass good cannabis

441
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,980
legislation you think

442
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,259
speaker Pelosi the Democrats in charge

443
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,610
of feel better is it still on to the

444
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:08,879
industry and the canvas community to

445
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:11,548
make that known now if you think that

446
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,210
you've done enough you haven't done

447
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:17,490
enough alright so how many of you here

448
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:21,778
have actually called your member of

449
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,909
Congress and I'm not talking all right

450
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:26,849
here's something you should do all right

451
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:29,010
call your member of Congress if you

452
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:31,199
remember if Congress is supportive you

453
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:35,190
call them up and say you know thank you

454
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,548
we're behind you so do your part also

455
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,620
and in terms of Democrats yes

456
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:42,990
Democrats want to get something done

457
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:47,038
there is a hearing in the Financial

458
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:49,679
Services Committee next week I'm in one

459
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,808
of the subcommittees that is a start I

460
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,538
mean heck this is February they've only

461
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:57,450
been in power for two months we had a

462
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:59,269
month-long government shutdown and one

463
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,840
of the early hearings is on this issue

464
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:08,220
so feel good about where we are continue

465
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:10,759
to push but also focus on what is the

466
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,009
art of the possible

467
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:18,298
you know if we could get everything we

468
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:20,579
wanted that'd be great but this is a

469
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:24,359
bipartisan effort you have a Democratic

470
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:29,668
House and a Republican Senate and a

471
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:31,769
Republican present so what is the magic

472
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,710
if you look at it as a triangle weathers

473
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,339
in the middle right what can everyone

474
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:41,940
agree on we believe it's the state side

475
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:43,500
but they need to know that and every you

476
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,840
know the house and the Senate and the

477
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,210
president

478
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,730
they all need to get their together we

479
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:52,329
take a little longer this Congress but

480
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:55,769
we feel strongly with your help and what

481
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:57,038
we're doing we'll be able to get there

482
00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:00,179
Melissa

483
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,859
kick this off to you it seems you have

484
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:05,019
really the most important job with the

485
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:07,869
Senate caucus no no pressure it all

486
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:11,440
depends on you with Mitch McConnell with

487
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:15,099
his position is it really all about

488
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,880
swain Mitch McConnell or is it things

489
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:21,250
that like Cory Gardner Republicans from

490
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,460
other states that have gone legal either

491
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,589
you know adult use or medical is it

492
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,610
convincing them to put pressure mr.

493
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:29,829
pound can you give us a little peek

494
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:32,199
behind the curtain about how we go about

495
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:34,778
you know getting a bill introduced in

496
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,048
this in it you bet it's a great question

497
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:39,788
it's the question right now so today

498
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:41,798
teams point you know we expect the house

499
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:43,720
to hold hearings on these issues pass a

500
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:46,629
lot of legislation whether it's on

501
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,490
banking individually some social justice

502
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,080
reform and then of course the states act

503
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,640
all of which will pass you'll see

504
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,710
headlines they'll go to the Senate right

505
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,210
and then it'll be crickets in the Senate

506
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,460
there's not going to be an immediate

507
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,740
response from the republican-led Senate

508
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,210
about what to do on these bills but we

509
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,919
do understand and believe very

510
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,019
wholeheartedly that the only possible

511
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,090
vehicle is the states Act so how do we

512
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:08,889
get the states act done well a couple

513
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:11,259
things we've got the White House support

514
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,059
president's team has already said if you

515
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:15,038
get States act on my desk I will sign it

516
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:16,538
great there's some leverage with Senate

517
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:20,859
Republicans who want to get elected in

518
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:22,450
2020 for example next analysis is okay

519
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:24,339
where does the bill get you know heard

520
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,808
is it in committee is it on another bill

521
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:27,609
those are things that we're still

522
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:30,398
working out about how the process would

523
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:33,219
actually get done but I can tell you

524
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:35,259
that we are aggressively pursuing Mitch

525
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,610
McConnell and his team and making the

526
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:39,398
case for why this is the right solution

527
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:41,379
if Kentucky wants to pass medical or

528
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,668
recreational marijuana they can but the

529
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,350
federal government isn't going to tell

530
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,299
them that they should that is an

531
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:48,449
argument that plays really well in

532
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:50,950
southern conservative states for example

533
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,450
on the flip side should cut should

534
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,038
Kentucky pass a measure it would go a

535
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,538
long way to help in our conversations

536
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,009
with Mitch McConnell's so just saying if

537
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,970
anybody wants to pass something in

538
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:00,009
Kentucky

539
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,559
would be helpful but we are very much

540
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:04,420
negotiating with that leadership office

541
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,649
mitch mcconnell's actually started

542
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,860
calling me the marijuana preacher

543
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,120
because we heard in there so much

544
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:12,639
pushing and trying to find a way to get

545
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,659
this done so like I said you'll see a

546
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,630
lot of bills come out of the house

547
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,460
you'll see some dialog about the Senate

548
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,680
and where those bills are gonna end up

549
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,930
and if this becomes an issue for enough

550
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,850
Senate Republicans where they go to

551
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,830
their leaders McConnell and others and

552
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:28,449
the leadership team and say this is

553
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:30,069
something that I need all of which is

554
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,110
being led and orchestrated by Cory

555
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:34,299
Gardner from Colorado then you'll see

556
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:36,579
some movement and that's really our

557
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:38,349
strategy and we're getting the meetings

558
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:40,869
we just did at Capitol Hill visits this

559
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:42,549
week we had 31 meetings with the

560
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:45,279
cannabis trade federation board and our

561
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:48,159
lobby team on Capitol Hill with members

562
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,039
that truly matter and this truly matter

563
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,690
in this analysis Senate Republicans

564
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:55,569
better what we consider to be the most

565
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,000
likely that we'll get all of whom said

566
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:59,710
keep talking to me tell me what else she

567
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,690
find out and let's find a way to get

568
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,670
this done so we're not quite there yet

569
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,380
but we're getting there and you can

570
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,820
always tell momentum in politics and we

571
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,460
feel the momentum and it's something we

572
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:10,450
should all be really excited about all

573
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,019
right yeah I got a couple more questions

574
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,069
where we kick it off to the audience for

575
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:18,009
their questions

576
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:20,109
I think wisely

577
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:22,450
you folks are concentrating on the

578
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:24,369
states act because that is what's

579
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,569
possible you know this may be best for

580
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:31,289
you but say with the states acts passed

581
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:34,899
passes and I think you see we've seen

582
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:36,879
the Democratic candidates all come

583
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,090
around to legalization either evolved

584
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,370
from former positions you didn't see Joe

585
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:44,199
Biden who was an architect a very bad

586
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:47,049
criminal justice legislation start to

587
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,059
kind of give some talk about why he was

588
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:51,159
wrong doing that in case he jumps in the

589
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:53,319
he jumps in the in the rain for

590
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:58,000
president and it seems to me Donald

591
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:59,950
Trump he is a you know really you know

592
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,690
in the 90s he's quoted as saying he

593
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,400
supported legalization of all drugs it

594
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,980
seems like he's very much a states

595
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,028
rights kind of libertarian on the issue

596
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:14,589
really so states acts passed

597
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:18,009
then what's next state's ax pass what

598
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:21,009
snacks first off if 288 goes away in 20

599
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:25,360
at any point 2019 it doesn't apply for

600
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:26,679
all of 2019 so what's next is if you're

601
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,369
pre paying your taxes at a federal

602
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:32,320
government you're getting a check back

603
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:34,538
so how it you know and folks know this

604
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,538
right when when your CPA fills out your

605
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:39,190
your your tax return they have to sign

606
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:40,960
an affidavit that says everything in

607
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,350
here is true therefore they have to take

608
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,538
280e into account States Act passes

609
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:49,628
there's we've taken the illegality out

610
00:24:46,538 --> 00:24:52,089
of this you don't have to take 280 into

611
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:53,798
account in your tax return they can sign

612
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:55,869
that affidavit without taking into

613
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:57,759
account the IRS would have to catch you

614
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:01,209
on audit and it wouldn't apply because

615
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:05,378
if any state license and legal business

616
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,850
would be removed from the CSA it if you

617
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:10,089
are licensed under so that's the

618
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:11,408
immediate impact we're gonna see credit

619
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:13,569
unions and community banks start

620
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,730
offering FDIC insured bank accounts and

621
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:16,689
real commercial banking services would

622
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,429
it be nice if you're running a good

623
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,720
business with a good bottom line and a

624
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:23,950
healthy EBIT uh that you can get a

625
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,950
business loan so those are the immediate

626
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,230
impacts and certainly don't have to work

627
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,879
like I said no one's gonna come from DOJ

628
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,319
and come kicking your doors and see is

629
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:34,418
all your assets for the crime of running

630
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,220
a state legal business as far as the

631
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:37,929
next Congress goes what we would like to

632
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,909
see come next is full federal

633
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:43,360
legalization with expungements and

634
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:44,769
that's what we'll work towards as far as

635
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,658
the whole suite of bills that

636
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:49,628
representative bloom an hour has put out

637
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,039
we agree you know outside of a 25%

638
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:55,418
excise tax we probably agree with just

639
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:58,240
about every one of them and so this as

640
00:25:55,419 --> 00:26:00,220
as nadim said states act as the art of

641
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,359
the possible the US Congress has never

642
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,610
given us anything outside of an

643
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,308
appropriations rider it was this would

644
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:08,589
be seismic permanent monumental change

645
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:11,168
and we're going for it we've assembled

646
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:14,288
the team to go for it where we need

647
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:16,389
everyone's support that we can get but

648
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:19,388
what comes next is we engage in a

649
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:21,069
dialogue of okay now that we've done

650
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:22,778
that how what does it look like what

651
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:23,740
does the end of prohibition look like on

652
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:25,359
the federal

653
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,440
there's a lot there's a lot of varying

654
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,918
opinions on that there's a lot of

655
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,090
stakeholders so we would convene those

656
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,250
stakeholders and we'd have a real

657
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:36,250
discussion about that and again but

658
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,509
where we think this needs to end is if

659
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,679
you have a criminal conviction for

660
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:41,650
something that's no longer you legal

661
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,530
that should be expunged and there should

662
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:50,110
be full federal end of prohibition as

663
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:52,690
soon as possible with the states Act if

664
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,759
it passes or what this goes when it

665
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:59,860
passes I think some of that would

666
00:26:54,759 --> 00:27:01,720
introduce entice California cultivators

667
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:05,048
I know it definitely entice cultivators

668
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,079
in Oregon what about exports with the

669
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:11,168
states Act allow states to interact to

670
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,939
agree to compacts if you know Nevada or

671
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:14,950
Arizona wants to import California

672
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,269
cannabis with the states Act I think

673
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,669
what does that allow that or what we

674
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:20,109
need a new legislation states act very

675
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:22,330
simply says if you're not in violation

676
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:24,279
of state law you're not in violation of

677
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:25,960
federal law so state law would rain

678
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,940
currently every state law says you

679
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,058
product can't leave a state boundary so

680
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,850
it would defer to state law all right

681
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:36,720
then last question for me before we kick

682
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:39,129
it back to the audiences how do people

683
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,620
support your work what do they need to

684
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,330
do cannabis trade federation calm you

685
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,788
can donate you can sign up for our list

686
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:49,899
you can volunteer you can call your

687
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:51,879
members of Congress and guy who got a

688
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,350
question from the audience for oh yes

689
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,270
indeed let's hear it once again for

690
00:27:53,349 --> 00:28:00,908
Anthony and all of our panelists and

691
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:02,589
reminds you question and answer period

692
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:04,150
please try to keep your questions brief

693
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:06,879
we don't need the whole history of

694
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,409
cannabis before you miss your question I

695
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,679
know how some New York and you've had

696
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:14,169
hash for breakfast all right here we go

697
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:17,048
Mike rezian from Oregon appreciate the

698
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:19,090
efforts on legislative area with the

699
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:21,129
states act what about the other side of

700
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:22,839
the coin what kind of news you have on

701
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:28,539
there just a completely d schedule in

702
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:30,788
front as we said I the the house is

703
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:32,579
probably going to pass more than the

704
00:28:30,788 --> 00:28:35,019
Senate would be willing to take up our

705
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,428
Intel is that there's absolutely no

706
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,499
appetite in that you

707
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:45,159
Senate in this Congress to deal with

708
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:47,048
full decrypt my question is uh with

709
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,669
regards to lobbying particularly the

710
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:50,769
Republicans is a John Bainer

711
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:54,278
engaged in any lobbying efforts with

712
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:56,740
Mitch McConnell they just drinking

713
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:58,200
buddies yeah Boehner is not a courage

714
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,690
and Bainer is not part of our coalition

715
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,298
so they are they aren't I don't know to

716
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,460
what level he's we're engaged with

717
00:29:04,298 --> 00:29:08,798
Speaker McConnell and we're in regular

718
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,179
talks and as Melissa said we're very

719
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:15,398
optimistic that we're making some

720
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:19,869
progress my question is in states cuz

721
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:21,908
Utah just recently passed a bill they

722
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:24,339
have passed a bill and they have since

723
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:28,419
gone through recently and are gutting it

724
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:31,418
with helps to certain outside

725
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:33,730
organizations maybe churches involved

726
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:35,499
there so what is the best way to

727
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,480
approach situations like that

728
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:39,159
I know lobbying senators and all that

729
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,159
kind of stuff is probably our best bet

730
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:44,649
but the Church of Jesus Christ has a

731
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,119
really large poll in the state of Utah

732
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:51,248
so unfortunately there what the what

733
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:55,298
happened there was that the campaign

734
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:57,788
team cut a deal before the election that

735
00:29:55,298 --> 00:30:00,128
they would go to this it whether the

736
00:29:57,788 --> 00:30:02,618
initiative passed or not they would go

737
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:06,339
to the legislature together to pass a

738
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:08,319
law that would be acceptable to the

739
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:12,069
governor and the establishment in Utah

740
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:13,808
so then it passed but the campaign had

741
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:15,009
already cut that di was obviously I

742
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:16,658
wasn't part of that but the campaign

743
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:18,069
already cut that deal so they're

744
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:19,778
adhering to the deal that they cut to

745
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:21,999
bring medical marijuana regardlessly the

746
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:27,388
result of the election so that's what's

747
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:31,778
happening there are there more questions

748
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:34,028
all the way that's something that you

749
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:38,470
notice really in every state that passes

750
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:42,210
a law is that it gets changed and or

751
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:45,940
most states it gets changed and so I

752
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:48,038
would encourage folks to make the people

753
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,190
that go against the will voters make

754
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:53,400
sure they pay a political price

755
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:56,400
and and and and let them know that as

756
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,950
people that supported it as patients as

757
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,610
an industry that you want the will of

758
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:04,590
the voters supported and then and then

759
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:06,839
really put political pressure on maybe

760
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:08,849
some key swing votes and really that

761
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,289
that in a place where yet you're up

762
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:11,759
against other interests that can be

763
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:14,430
tough to do but really that's that's the

764
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,379
only thing you can do or you know yet

765
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,850
try to correct it with a future

766
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,860
legislation to get back to what the will

767
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:21,839
the voters want that's a good point we

768
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,509
still need activists everybody lobbyists

769
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,889
are cool too but activists ma'am be in

770
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:28,589
the halls talk to your people get

771
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,390
everybody fired up this might be

772
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:32,939
premature but I was just wondering if in

773
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:35,490
your conversations with lawmakers if

774
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,830
imports have been addressed on the

775
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,319
federal level obviously I come from the

776
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:42,839
long history of flower growing in

777
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:50,000
Southern California and South America is

778
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:53,669
is crippled our industry well so so

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,809
right now outside of so there there are

780
00:31:53,670 --> 00:32:01,800
importing some Canadian cannabis for

781
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:03,839
research which is actually incredibly

782
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,399
annoying that they're not using American

783
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:12,240
cannabis for that research right we have

784
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:16,259
better anyway absolutely so but but

785
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,859
outside of that no imports and and again

786
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:23,339
states act is simply diverse a state law

787
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:25,469
so as far as international borders and

788
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:29,339
boundaries go that would have to come in

789
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:31,230
we'd have to address that next Chris

790
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:32,579
Conrad here thanks great panel I'm

791
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,410
really hoping the feds do something this

792
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:35,309
year with you guys but um I'm just

793
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,570
warning on the other side of the

794
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,299
equation seems to be like we've got the

795
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:40,980
court system and historically we've had

796
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:43,379
a mixed bag I mean like they obviously

797
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,019
the OCB decision OCBC they said they

798
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,070
couldn't the ural defend an Associated

799
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:48,750
offense for distribution of marijuana

800
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:50,009
then we had race decisions saying that

801
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,690
the feds could raid you in your home for

802
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,339
medical marijuana even if you're a state

803
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,769
licensed patient but more recently we've

804
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:58,439
had things like the San Diego decision

805
00:32:55,769 --> 00:33:00,240
that said that they couldn't use federal

806
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,190
law to overturn california's marijuana's

807
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,819
laws and they also had the

808
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:08,130
Oklahoma versus Colorado decision so um

809
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:11,129
they said that they couldn't force

810
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,480
Colorado to recriminate sex on other

811
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,800
states so I'm just wondering about

812
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,019
what's going on on the pike right now is

813
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,399
there some cases we should be watching

814
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:18,720
do you see any kind of cases that might

815
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,460
be people might be thinking about filing

816
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,480
in terms if you wanted to try to use of

817
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,920
course system I know that was very

818
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,240
effective for the gay rights movement

819
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,800
but we haven't really had the same kind

820
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,099
of relationship with the court system

821
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,899
and thank you again yeah this is me

822
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,219
again

823
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:36,600
we have some questions for some of the

824
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,890
lobbyists a whether here the the so the

825
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,329
most concern it Chris the most

826
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,520
concerning recent cases were some of the

827
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:45,269
tax cases that are all coming in the

828
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,920
governments favor for 280 the the

829
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:52,230
Harborside case I think was very

830
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:55,769
concerning they ruled the tax years that

831
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:58,650
they ruled on for that case weren't

832
00:33:55,769 --> 00:34:00,930
their most profitable years so it was

833
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:04,980
those that ruling was five or six a year

834
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:08,099
the period was five or six years ago and

835
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,820
they ruled that they absolutely had to

836
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:14,299
pay to a de that wasn't paid and then

837
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,260
there was a secondary ruling that that

838
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,030
there was a little bit of a victory I've

839
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,530
taken about it which was confusing to me

840
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,149
because the judge kind of had mercy on

841
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,669
them and said we're not going to apply

842
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:26,730
the twenty percent penalty kicker but

843
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:29,190
they still lost the case and it's going

844
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,840
I mean I don't know what the exact tax

845
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,159
burden is but back of the envelope math

846
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:37,140
looks like that could be a nine figure

847
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:42,179
tax bill so that's bad there was another

848
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:44,879
case that showed that management the

849
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,190
management company structures that the

850
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,169
IRS could pierce that veil and could

851
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,360
apply to a de taxation even if you're a

852
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:53,369
management holding company because you

853
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,370
are part of the conspiracy and then

854
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:59,579
therefore you are touching the plan so

855
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:02,400
those are incredibly concerning court

856
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:05,190
rulings that are coming down we have

857
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,590
Congress must act we have to fix this

858
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,559
conflict this has to go away to a te

859
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,630
will crush this industry sooner rather

860
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,539
than later later if we can't make this

861
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:19,619
go away so that's that's the urge

862
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:24,360
see that I see there that some of the

863
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:26,819
RICO cases are concerning but that that

864
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:30,620
initially went our way but in Colorado

865
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:33,960
but that's getting appealed up so

866
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,859
overall I would say look the federal

867
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,260
government never brought a preemption

868
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,519
case and probably the reason they

869
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,150
haven't done that is because they feel

870
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:44,000
that they would lose and you know this

871
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,920
all goes back to Congress needs to act

872
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,539
the courts the courts are frustrated

873
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,269
from from what we're seeing and what

874
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:54,420
we're hearing from some folks from the

875
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:57,239
bench they're frustrated and saying that

876
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,800
we need direction here we need you know

877
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,199
these are people who are not violating

878
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,780
the law who are abiding by regulated

879
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,939
system that are paying their taxes but

880
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:11,490
they're violating federal law you guys

881
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:13,950
need to figure this out and so I'm

882
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:15,829
concerned about the tax stuff that's

883
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:18,719
coming in the courts right now the the

884
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:21,000
ideology of those being appointed to the

885
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,419
bench versus those who are being elected

886
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,969
to Congress is significantly different a

887
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,500
lot of if you watch those who are being

888
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:30,329
appointed to the bench right now in the

889
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,269
federal circuit they're people in their

890
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:36,000
mid 40s mid 50s grew up in the era of

891
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:39,150
just say no very heavily law enforcement

892
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,630
you know their world view is in a place

893
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:44,160
that is much different and both

894
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,349
Republicans and Democrats in Congress

895
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,480
you're getting younger members those who

896
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,489
are directly influenced by what's going

897
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,949
on in their states there isn't that same

898
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:55,259
level of influence that happens in the

899
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:58,139
judiciary is an independent judiciary so

900
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,810
in addition to the conflict and this and

901
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:02,369
the technical challenges I think if you

902
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:04,289
look at who's getting a point that

903
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:07,109
they're very very law and order types

904
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:10,800
who come from that and I'm 47 I mean I

905
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,539
remember that whole era too and so just

906
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,190
Congress is a better place for us to

907
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:16,110
fight these battles well let me add one

908
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,519
more thing on the judicial front - right

909
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,289
everyone knew where Attorney General

910
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,610
Jeff Sessions was on this issue and it

911
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:22,739
was never gonna be helpful to the

912
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,150
industry we're about to get a new AG

913
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,799
bill Barr who went through his

914
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,599
confirmation hearings a couple weeks ago

915
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,390
and

916
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,369
said I know that businesses and states

917
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:32,748
relied upon the Cole memo and then the

918
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:34,759
government pulled that away and that's

919
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:37,399
unfair and I'm not gonna enforce against

920
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:39,199
them which was a huge moment right I

921
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,849
mean knowing that the new AG wasn't

922
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,439
gonna come in and completely upend

923
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:44,720
everything that you as business owners

924
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,519
and consumers had relied upon so he's

925
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,288
going through his meetings by meetings

926
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:50,238
with individual senators on the hill and

927
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:52,369
we're hearing consistently that what he

928
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,528
said publicly is what he's committing to

929
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,778
them privately particularly Cory Gardner

930
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:59,389
who he met with on Tuesday or on

931
00:37:56,778 --> 00:38:02,539
Wednesday so there's a lot in terms of

932
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:04,358
momentum here where at least we know the

933
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:06,859
next Attorney General is not going to be

934
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:09,798
another Jeff Sessions and speaking of

935
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:13,248
Senator Gardner for one second senator

936
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:15,288
Gardner felt that AG sessions lied to

937
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,298
him and then went out on the floor of

938
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:20,960
the US Congress and put a hold on every

939
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:25,159
DOJ appointment until he cut a deal with

940
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:29,449
the president for us who has ever done

941
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:35,239
anything like that for us it was a

942
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:36,919
seismic moment yeah I just want to kind

943
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,630
of reiterate neo's point if you're in

944
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,479
the industry I definitely you definitely

945
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:45,410
pay attention to the RICO cases the tax

946
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:46,578
cases also as activist I think there's

947
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:49,338
something you can do in some of these

948
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:51,410
RICO cases is to pay attention as as to

949
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:54,380
who is filing them and Oregon like a

950
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:57,440
winery filed a writ filed a civil like

951
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:00,798
RICO case and the winery then got bad

952
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,509
publicity and activists kind of say hey

953
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:04,489
we're gonna boycott your wine if you

954
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:08,659
don't you know if you continue with this

955
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:11,778
suit and in Oregon industry estimates

956
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:14,358
are that 41% of Oregonians use cannabis

957
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:16,369
within the last month so that's a big

958
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:18,978
market that's a big market so I think

959
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:21,528
activists have a role to step up in some

960
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:24,919
of these state RICO cases sometimes and

961
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:27,079
with the you know race case race Supreme

962
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,599
Court case where the feds could still

963
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,079
enforce federal law when a patient when

964
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,088
a legal patient is growing

965
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,249
canvas in their own backyard not giving

966
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:36,690
it to anybody else I don't unlike the

967
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,978
gay rights movement I think there's a

968
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,829
lot of parallels between the gay rights

969
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:41,818
movement and the cannabis movement

970
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:45,239
unlike that we're not going to have the

971
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:47,818
courts save us and so politically is is

972
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:48,838
where we have to we have to make the

973
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,728
change because the courts aren't going

974
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:52,498
to do it we need to change the law in

975
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:53,578
Congress all right thank you we're

976
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:55,858
almost out of time we have time for

977
00:39:53,579 --> 00:40:01,259
maybe one more is it quick for four more

978
00:39:55,858 --> 00:40:03,088
minutes I got word quick question here

979
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:05,728
in California we tried to lower our

980
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:09,150
cannabis taxes didn't work out because

981
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:12,268
the revenue was gonna go down States and

982
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:14,789
government seem to be against lowering

983
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:16,708
sin taxes 280e seems like one of the

984
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:19,859
largest sin taxes that's ever existed

985
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:22,288
with the state sac passing hopefully do

986
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:23,728
we see revenue for cannabis businesses

987
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:25,619
going to the federal government going

988
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:27,058
down or are they gonna figure out some

989
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:30,450
other way to get their money out of us

990
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:32,219
when the Congress passed 280 in 1982

991
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:36,358
they never envisioned an industry like

992
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:38,458
ours that was its being its Technic

993
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,170
letter of the law is correct but it is

994
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:44,548
being misapplied to us and it was done

995
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,979
on purpose so the state's Act fixes to

996
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:50,400
80 to 80 penalty would no longer apply

997
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:54,328
to cannabis businesses who are who are

998
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,338
abiding by state law the federal

999
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:59,269
government will then respond with trying

1000
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:01,588
to come at us with an excise tax and

1001
00:40:59,268 --> 00:41:02,639
that's also part of the reason why we

1002
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:04,768
built such a great team

1003
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,298
so how wonderful would it be as an

1004
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:09,448
industry that we actually get to pivot

1005
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:10,889
from asking to be treated fairly and

1006
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:12,630
like every other business and every

1007
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:15,389
other industry in the country to

1008
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:18,329
actually advocating to not tax us out of

1009
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:19,920
existence which is a tough position to

1010
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:22,318
take right now while we're asking them

1011
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,630
to you know not seize all of our assets

1012
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,639
and not take all of our profit through a

1013
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,608
provision in the tax code that was meant

1014
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:33,239
to take all the profit out of illegal

1015
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:34,619
businesses and 280e works as constructed

1016
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,358
it works very well it takes all the

1017
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,709
profit out of your business but it

1018
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,159
shouldn't be applied for us and States

1019
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:42,149
Act would fix it

1020
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,829
great great good morning thanks for a

1021
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,579
great discussion just want to come back

1022
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:48,509
the import/export discussion quickly

1023
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:50,190
under the state's act where do you see

1024
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,090
things coming next in terms of the bill

1025
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,860
Aditya export Oh to California or other

1026
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,690
jurisdictions into other global markets

1027
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,269
and secondly back to the comment on

1028
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,860
import saw this morning a press release

1029
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:04,739
from a Colombian company was just

1030
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:07,050
approved to export into Canada legally

1031
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,579
for the first time this morning again do

1032
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:12,390
you see that kind of coming forward into

1033
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:14,219
the US market eventually yes the state's

1034
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:15,719
act just would end the conflict between

1035
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:18,359
federal and state law so I wouldn't open

1036
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:20,609
up international borders but again going

1037
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:24,240
back to my example with Vermont passing

1038
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:26,370
that first seismic change that actually

1039
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,619
changes the law and ends the conflict is

1040
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:30,210
way harder than amending the law once

1041
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:33,900
it's on the books as we're figuring out

1042
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:35,639
how to do this so of course once the

1043
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,500
Congress says ok this is a legitimate

1044
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:40,559
industry and all these businesses are

1045
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,239
not in violation of the law then our

1046
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,039
full expectations Congress is going to

1047
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,389
move and they're going to move to set up

1048
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,309
regulation and they're going to end

1049
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:50,069
prohibition and that's going to open up

1050
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:52,469
all imports all exports international

1051
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:56,220
markets but probably not in this

1052
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:59,219
Congress yeah in Oregon there has been

1053
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:02,789
legislation introduced that would allow

1054
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:05,429
the governor of Oregon to introduce into

1055
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:07,019
agreements with other states to export

1056
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:09,119
cannabis so I think of this once the

1057
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:10,949
states Act gets passed then the pressure

1058
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,779
kind of how we've legalized

1059
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:14,719
state-by-state we do the same thing with

1060
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,030
exports and you move state-by-state and

1061
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:20,549
get States to agree to explore with each

1062
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,070
other and then we get some action in

1063
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:26,490
Congress as well in the next legislative

1064
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,990
action sounds good to me

1065
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:29,819
I look forward to smoking Oregon weed

1066
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:36,239
without having to make a six-hour drive

1067
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:38,990
I think I could weed an organ let's hear

1068
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:42,699
it again for our entire panel

1069
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:42,699
[Applause]
