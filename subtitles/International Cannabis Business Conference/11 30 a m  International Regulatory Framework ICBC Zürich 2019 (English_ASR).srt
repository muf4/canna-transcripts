4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:12,660
I had a we already had a panel in

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,829
barthelona and Garrett is a cannabis a

6

and management um you have been in

11

business segments across multiple

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,549
customer channels with proven record of

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,189
exceeding multi-million dollar goals

14
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,929
with while expanding new businesses

15
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,289
lines and profile opportunities is that

16
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:50,250
right I don't know who sent that but yes

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,590
and when it comes to regulation and

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,159
we're talking when it comes to cannabis

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,890
regulation and we talk in frameworks

20
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,968
regular regular regulatory frameworks

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:08,250
we're talking about a lot of frameworks

22
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:10,490
keywords em are a GMP GP PJ APC novel

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,840
food regulation and so on and so on

24
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:21,390
you're producing hemp in Kentucky the

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,969
USA does not yet have a similar

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,140
regulation framework like Canada or the

27
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,728
European community has is that right and

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,228
in which way does that affect your

29
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:35,069
especially your international business

30
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:38,368
connections sure so currently the

31
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:41,548
foundation of the US market started with

32
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:44,700
some legislation around hemp farming as

33
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,939
a as a crop right and that's what we see

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,570
today under the US under the farm bill

35
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:53,188
that recently passed legalizing hemp as

36
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,199
a as a crop in the United States

37
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:58,258
federally now you still have

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,359
state-by-state considerations and state

39
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,609
by state legislation that needs to

40
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,159
potentially align certain states with

41
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:07,438
the federal legislation some states have

42
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,899
done a really good job of that Kentucky

43
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,519
being one of them that's why we're there

44
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,960
so they have done a great job of putting

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,120
into putting a framework together with

46
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,010
the state that complements the federal

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,259
legislation which is enabled a very

48
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,609
successful hemp program and I believe

49
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:23,649
the model that will be rolled out across

50
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,670
the entire United States at some point

51
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,430
as as the Layton states the states that

52
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:32,559
have not come on so quickly realize the

53
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,960
economic opportunity for the farmers and

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,849
for the rest of the tangent businesses

55
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,750
are not developing as quickly in their

56
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,889
states they're gonna look to other

57
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,900
states that have been successful and

58
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:43,299
copy that model so I think from a

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,520
legislative perspective the US has done

60
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,180
a good job of paving the way for the

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,850
crop as an agricultural commodity what

62
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,960
we're waiting on is the FDA to weigh in

63
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:58,599
on what is hemp derived CBD and

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,240
cannabinoids is it a food is it as

65
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,379
nutritional supplement or is it a drug

66
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,570
right or pharmaceutical and there is a

67
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:11,409
meeting at the end of May the FDA is

68
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:13,750
hosting a public comment and Gymkhana

69
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:16,750
will be participating as well as the USF

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,689
Browne table to provide public comment

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,259
on you know where this fits into the

72
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:24,909
economy how it helps farmers and and

73
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:27,909
folks that are using it in the community

74
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:30,639
so the FDA we're hoping goes back

75
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:32,620
considers these facts and comes back

76
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,479
with guidance that clearly defines and

77
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,849
we're looking for structure we're not we

78
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,949
don't believe it's about safety in the

79
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,930
end right food safety supplement safety

80
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,639
and drug safety so we don't believe that

81
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,439
we're not just asking for carp lunch

82
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,899
we're saying come back with a reasonable

83
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,050
framework that we can implement on

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,349
labels right nutrition fact panels

85
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:56,080
ingredient fact panels and and something

86
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:58,840
we can actually put into into our

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:04,020
business plans as we build and get into

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:07,330
mass market retail how important el is

89
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,730
the compliance of your framework with

90
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,190
other frameworks international framework

91
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,929
a lot of national frameworks sure so

92
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:17,529
we've spent a considerable amount of

93
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,379
effort and resources in creating a

94
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:24,839
compliant and accredited manufacturing

95
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:27,550
and processing framework from cGMP BRC

96
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,489
was known as British Retail Consortium

97
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,400
one point it's a very high level of

98
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,710
audit scheme for food great standards

99
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,598
internationally so we've we've gone

100
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:40,478
after all of these accreditation Xand

101
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:44,649
audits in order to create a platform to

102
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:47,258
launch quality safe products this

103
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:50,079
industry has been plagued by a trust

104
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:52,180
issue with consumers right there hasn't

105
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,490
been a lot of trust between consumers

106
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,379
and where that product came from you

107
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,569
know where was it grown how is it

108
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,908
manufactured it's kind of been a gray

109
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,370
market right and I think it's time that

110
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:06,310
folks in this injury's industry rise up

111
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,228
and create standards and adhere to

112
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,970
global standards of manufacturing that

113
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:12,370
will create trust with consumers and

114
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,389
take this industry from being a gray

115
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,158
market industry into being a global

116
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:22,360
market industry thank you very much

117
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:25,569
Garrett so let me introduce to you dr.

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:30,000

121
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:42,430
rotc Pharmaceuticals established in

122

International Association for cannibal

126
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,210
cannibal need medicines which makes him

127
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:59,918
an expert on both fields on the one side

128
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:04,899
on the economic field on the on the

129
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:09,329
other side on the medical field so my

130
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:12,489
first question to you recently

131
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:15,718
irregularly the the framework is about

132
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:20,379
medicine and about product

133
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:25,509
what would you say needs to be needs to

134
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:28,300
be implemented faster on international

135
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:30,520
level the regulation for medical

136
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,189
international regulations for medical

137
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,139
for cannabis medicines are regulations

138
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,918
for cannabis products on international

139
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:41,000
level

140
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:43,819
good morning everybody just to qualify

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,788
what Mika just said we were a company

142
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:50,120
that do two things were very active in

143
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:51,918
the in the field of edibles and our

144
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,168
first products we launched in January of

145
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,680
this year in Germany which is a Swiss

146
00:06:54,168 --> 00:07:00,049
chocolate containing the cannabis

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,189
extract and we're active in the area of

148
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,560
pharmaceuticals as well but

149
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:07,339
Pharmaceuticals is more our medium

150
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,839
longer-term business plan we already

151
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:10,250
have two products that are ready one is

152
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,198
for the treatment of glaucoma and the

153
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,848
other one is for bronchial disorders

154
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:19,270
asthma particularly I thought you were

155
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:22,339
actually gonna ask me about novel foods

156
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:24,469
good question because we have to do some

157
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,049
more types because and I know you're the

158
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,930
expert the medical front in a way is

159
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,949
somewhat more advanced than the food

160
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,769
area at the moment particularly since

161
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:40,908
you you probably all know that the the

162
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:42,439
w-h-o came out last year the the expert

163
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:45,279
committee on drugs a dependence came up

164
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,019
with recommendations about rescheduling

165
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,388
cannabis from scheduled for completely

166
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:53,538
delisting it and also delisting cannabis

167
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:55,340
extracts from schedule one which

168
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:57,769
actually also gives hope to a lot of the

169
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:01,250
CBD players in the world because if it's

170
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:04,448
off that then that supposedly can open

171
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,800
up some opportunities for the CBD market

172
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,870
things are moving on the under medical

173
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,710
front because in January of this year in

174
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:15,560
the EU a group of em EPS that put a

175
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:17,388
motion for resolution to the European

176
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,788
Commission that was adopted under 17th

177
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:24,319
of February for the medical use the

178
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:28,098
harmonization of the medical use of

179
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,519
cannabis medicines in the EU and also to

180
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:35,450
encourage and promote research in the EU

181
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:38,569
for medicine purposes so that's that's

182
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,339
moving ahead quite nicely and don't

183
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,459
forget in the background you also have

184
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,110
GW Pharmaceuticals who applied for

185
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:48,559
approval for epidural X in the EU market

186
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,060
- so that's spending and we expect

187
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,589
something

188
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:53,319
to come in the next couple of months

189
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,480
regarding that so it's the medical side

190
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,028
is moving quite quite nicely ahead in

191
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,730
the EU market the food side is in a bit

192
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:03,519
of a chaos at the moment a chaos because

193
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,440
since January of this year you know

194
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,100
everyone's been talking about novel

195
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,779
foods this morning up until 2018 it was

196
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
already very complicated and in

197
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:14,320
fragmented in terms of the

198
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,360
interpretation in different countries in

199
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,660
the EU it got worse in January because

200
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,250
the European Commission decided to try

201
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,709
and clarify things I think it was in an

202
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,299
effort to clarify and they made some

203
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,610
amendments to what's called a novel

204
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:29,289
foods catalog so if you go on the

205
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,200
internet you type in novel foods

206
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,849
catalogue EU pop up a page and you can

207
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,400
search in there and you can put in

208
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,350
cannabis and today there will be three

209
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,409
references that will come up three

210
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:45,278
entries one is about the plant cannabis

211
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:47,919
sativa L which is not a novel food then

212
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:51,159
there's cannabinoids and then there's

213
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,529
kind of BD all candy BD all has has a

214
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,259
red mark against it and cannabinoids has

215
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,649
a red mark against it - they are at the

216
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:00,580
moment up for novel food status let's

217
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,759
say put it that way

218
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,330
so it's another thing you need to

219
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,679
understand that the catalogue itself

220
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,780
different from the regulation because

221
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,789
there is an actual ratio let me ask let

222
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,279
me let me ask you regulation a small

223
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:20,799
question in betweens Lise just for the

224
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:23,769
better understanding so cannabis sativa

225
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,349
L is also listed sure it's in the it's

226
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:32,919
in it's in the catalogue and it's not a

227
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:34,480
novel food planet so if if the THC level

228
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:38,229
is in compliance you could put a

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,889
cannabis sativa L sure in the food here

230
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,600
without oh sure and don't forget

231
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,629
cannabis sativa has been consumed in the

232
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,700
European market for centuries the year

233
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:52,958
the European industrial hemp Association

234
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:55,778
met with the working group it's called a

235
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:59,139
p.m. it's called let me see now it's got

236
00:10:55,778 --> 00:11:01,240
a funny name plants animals food and

237
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:02,789
feed that's the name of it in it's a

238
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,500
working group that

239
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:09,329
Commission defer to for determining

240
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,210
whether a substance is considered novel

241
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,129
food or not so the European industrial

242
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:17,370
hemp Association met with that committee

243
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:20,490
in on the 12th of March showed shared

244
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,610
with them basically the usage the

245
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:27,409
consumption even industrial quantities

246
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:33,690
of hemp products hemp extracts in the EU

247
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:36,000
going back to 1220 in Bologna if it's

248
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,230
it's it's nothing new and you know

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,909
Mikael mozi man

250
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,399
I completely agree what he was saying

251
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:44,579
it's nothing though yeah so what you

252
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,709
actually say is that if you use the term

253
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,650
cannabis sativa L instead of curs

254
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,450
cannabidiol you can stock up ship so the

255
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:54,110
regulation so you need to understand

256
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,750
your regulations you need to understand

257
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,769
what type of ingredients you're using

258
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,929
what is allowed and what's not allowed

259
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:04,199
you need to understand the regulation or

260
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:07,139
novel foods read it carefully because it

261
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,100
is clear actually it is clear it's a big

262
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:14,490
document but it is clear you need to

263
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,110
understand processing conditions you

264
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:22,860
need to understand labeling because

265
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:25,560
currently today's CBD on a product is

266
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,480
not compliant and the reason it's not

267
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,369
compliant and the reason why a lot of

268
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,430
countries in the EU such as Austria

269
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:35,519
Italy Germany most recently have been

270
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:37,169
marching in with police and removing

271
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,990
products from the shelves and finding

272
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:44,729
people and arresting people is because

273
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:47,370
CBD simply is not yet considered a novel

274
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,980
food the individual substance the

275
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,279
molecule is CBD if it's called cannabis

276
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,529
sativa L that's fine

277
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,120
that's not a problem that's okay so what

278
00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:00,120
you say is you just don't have to put

279
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:05,299
CBD or on a label on the label that's

280
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,889
right and you avoid a lot of problems so

281
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:11,009
your cannabis sativa of course it

282
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:13,100
contains CBD okay yeah just to make a

283
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:15,970
note on that in US it's a similar

284
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,370
similar scenario with

285
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,680
of a lot of sellers on Amazon actually

286
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,310
are selling CBD products but they're

287
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:26,979
calling hemp extract it's very it's kind

288
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,958
of a sleight of hand but by not calling

289
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,930
out CBD specifically and calling it a

290
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,698
hemp extract they're able to remain as

291
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:36,008
resellers on Amazon there's another

292
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:38,169
confusion in the EU space and and it

293
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:40,149
goes back to the the change that was

294
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:44,799
made in January in the in the novel

295
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:46,720
Foods catalog as I said in 2018 there

296
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,438
were only kind of video in cannabis

297
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,139
sativa L there was no cannabinoids so

298
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:55,120
they what they did is in an effort I

299
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,769
think to clarify but it actually made it

300
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,389
more confusing they just threw

301
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,179
everything into one basket including

302
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:03,698
extracts and this is where the confusion

303
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:05,979
also lies does it say cannabinoids in

304
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:08,109
general or does it define this in every

305
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,930
know it says cannabinoids in the entry

306
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,850
and inside that entry they list all

307
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:15,789
different cannabinoids and they also

308
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,939
make reference to extracts also being

309
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:20,649
considered a novel food and there's also

310
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:22,990
a grey zone because they don't

311
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:28,600
specifically mention whether it's the

312
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:30,490
leaf whether it's the flower so it made

313
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,120
it worse what they did is really made

314
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,370
the situation worse one another mep a

315
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,220
guy called marco Zullo from from that

316
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,198
crazy country italy he he wrote to the

317
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,509
european commission he made an official

318
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,568
written request to the Commission to

319
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,490
clarify this situation in Europe

320
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:53,229
regarding foods and regarding cosmetics

321
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,089
he did that in March now they're given

322

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,350
from Super Lawyer in California he

334
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:29,319
founded a Super Lawyer together with his

335
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,629
brother Jeff super in 2003

336
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,190
I'm super faciliate collaboration among

337
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,169
his colleagues and the system with

338
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,480
growing and client relationship mr.

339
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:39,639
super also manages intellectual property

340
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,399
and disputes and deals around the world

341
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,679
and consults consults clients in

342
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,299
relation to global intellectual property

343
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:53,139
portfolios and as I think I can say you

344
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:55,649
are specialized also on canopies regular

345
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:59,529
regulatory framework in California and

346
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:01,449
my first question is how does the

347
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,850
disparity of cannabis regulations

348
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,400
between federal state provincial and

349
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,590
municipal governments complicate

350
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,669
cannabis cannabis commercial Commerce

351
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,870
and the USA yes thank you mika so i was

352
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,309
originally asked to speak on an

353
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,529
intellectual property panel so I think

354
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:20,379
that that bio was suited for that but I

355
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,789
also on the managing partner of super

356
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,439
Lawler and we've been in the cannabis

357
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:25,149
industry in the US for over 12 years so

358
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,730
we represent many of the biggest players

359
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,620
in the u.s. cannabis space and in that

360
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,139
context I deal with a lot of regulatory

361
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,610
work FDA work and other work in

362
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,679
association with cannabis companies as

363
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,050
well as fortune companies to answer your

364
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,500
question as far as the disparity between

365
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:42,669
federal and state and municipal

366
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,029
regulations cannabis related regulations

367
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:48,370
in the States it creates a a great big

368
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:51,939
mess and so I guess in that sense it's

369
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:54,759
not unlike the EU so just for folks who

370
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,320
don't know in the United States there

371
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,929
are indeed three different levels of

372
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,210
regulation oversimplify things you have

373
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:04,659
of course the federal regulation the US

374
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:06,069
regulations and the FDA is going to at

375
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,980
some point regulate just about

376
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,319
everything and the underneath the

377
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,819
federal regulations you have states of

378
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,220
course much like Canada split into

379
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,599
provinces the EU split in the countries

380
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,309
the United States is split into 50

381
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,188
states plus territories are in each

382
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:24,879
state has its own disposition toward

383
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,890
cannabis CBD products THC products and

384
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,900
other cannabinoid products and then even

385
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,090
within each state municipalities differ

386
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,009
in the way that they regulate the

387
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,379
cannabis that the plant and products

388
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:37,089
that touch the plant and so in this

389
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,360
context there's a great deal of variance

390
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:42,429
so even though the federal government

391
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:45,429
has decided

392
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:48,070
so in the United States the prohibition

393
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,930
of cannabis is affected by what's called

394
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:52,480
the Controlled Substances Act and

395
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,480
cannabis until recently

396
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,519
CBD as well has been on Schedule one of

397
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,250
that act of the Controlled Substances

398
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,400
Act along with heroin and cocaine

399
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:06,670
so recently just this year the Congress

400
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,930
D scheduled CBD that's derived from hemp

401
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:13,690
so long as the CBD product contains less

402
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,299
than 0.3 percent THC it's categorized

403
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:20,500
this hemp and that's legal so to speak

404
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:22,149
but even still there are variances in in

405
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,549
terms of the states and how they

406
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,470
regulate hemp so as an example in

407
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:28,299
California you can't just start growing

408
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,529
hemp you can't create a farm to start

409
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:32,440
growing hemp and that's counterintuitive

410
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:34,660
in some sense you've got to part partner

411
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,880
currently with an agricultural research

412
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,029
institution and it's as complicated and

413
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,070
complex as it sounds because there is no

414
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:44,440
pathway to obtain a license to grow hemp

415
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:47,769
in California so that varies state by

416
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,539
state in the US furthermore THC is still

417
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,119
on schedule one of the Controlled

418
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:53,700
Substances Act so it's still treated

419
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,019
like heroin at least theoretically

420
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,299
however the federal government turns the

421
00:18:56,019 --> 00:19:00,250
other way and so each of the individual

422
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,250
states is left to regulate THC

423
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,079
containing products and there's a great

424
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,339
deal of variance among the states over

425
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:11,500
30 states have legalized THC to some

426
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:13,509
extent whether to a medicinal level or

427
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,670
to a recreational level and then

428
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:18,039
underneath that the municipalities also

429
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:21,690
differ in the way that they regulate the

430
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:26,409
THC plant so what you have in the end is

431
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:29,529
really a an inability to have a national

432
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,650
strategy in relation to a THC product

433
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:34,480
and and what that means in effect is

434
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,430
that you've got to begin operations they

435
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,099
novel in each state so as to how this

436
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,960
affects things well as an example it's

437
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:42,429
awfully difficult to create a brand in

438
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,059
the sense that you do in other other

439
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:48,400
industries so if I have a well let's say

440
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,889
I'm having a can of coca-cola here in

441
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,140
Zurich and I have a can of coca-cola in

442
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,880
Tokyo or back home in California I have

443
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,750
substantially the same experience right

444
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,030
I

445
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,920
exactly the same user experience almost

446
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:02,649
the same brand experience except for the

447
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,410
language differences in cannabis if I go

448
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:08,620
to the same retailer shop here in Zurich

449
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,240
or in California did the experience

450
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:12,159
within a brand can change month to month

451
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,470
so then when you consider the fact that

452
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,230
in the United States the regulations

453
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:20,039
vary by state and furthermore you can't

454
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,630
ship THC across state lines in the US

455
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,869
how much more difficult does it become

456
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,040
to create a consistent user experience

457
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:28,599
and so when you think about it that's

458
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,019
everything that's associated with a

459
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,209
brand

460
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,400
so as the cannabis industry grows up

461
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,259
this disparity between federal and state

462
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,769
and municipal regulations is going to

463
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:40,000
increasingly become a greater focus for

464
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,889
cannabis companies that are going to be

465
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,420
more ambitious and trying to create a

466
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,400
consistency of user experience

467
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,610
underneath the brand across state and

468
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,519
sovereign borders thank you very much so

469
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:54,279
what we have heard so far in any country

470
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:59,740
or in every country the national

471
00:20:54,279 --> 00:21:04,089
regulations are and are not a homo

472
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:06,130
gained all over Omegan in most countries

473
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:10,149
even within the countries they differ

474
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:13,720
and on a scale from one to ten somewhat

475
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:16,120
what you say how much does that

476
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,130
influence international cannabis

477
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,839
business development or the the

478
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,300
international development of the kana

479
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,209
business between one and ten points what

480
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:27,789
would you say so I would split that into

481
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,850
two answers one is the THC answer and

482
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:32,680
I'd say it's a 10 in regard to hemp

483
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:35,529
derived CBD I'd say it's still probably

484
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,269
a 2 and and so in regard to THC

485
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,740
obviously if you try and ship something

486
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:40,480
across the United States border you're

487
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,950
going to get arrested so so there's that

488
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,710
in regard to hemp derived CBD there are

489
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,590
still issues it's legal but apparently

490
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,390
some federal institutions some United

491
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:54,939
States governmental institutions didn't

492
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,920
get the memo that hemp is now legal so

493
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,509
products containing CBD will still get

494
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,490
stopped at the border and so you've got

495
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:02,859
a hire an attorney to go educate

496
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,240
relative governmental operatives and say

497
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:05,559
you know what this is legal I need to

498
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,359
let it through all right so that's

499
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,039
that's still going on in the United

500
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,099
States

501
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,519
and CBB that that would be for CBD

502
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:17,949
correct so so CBD it should make it

503
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,960
through and you can theoretically ship

504
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,120
CBD product across the border and in

505
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,950
fact our law firm is involved in

506
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,509
conversations and in relation to a

507
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,819
number of territories throughout the

508
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:29,799
world but you wouldn't de sure a client

509
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:31,450
that that if you try and ship CBD from

510
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,609
here to there across the United States

511
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,710
border that it won't get stopped because

512
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:37,000
folks are still considering that a drug

513
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,610
and then you've got to explain though

514
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,930
the the the farm bill was passed this is

515
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,819
legal now and you need to let it through

516
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,250
and that's that's that's a conversation

517
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:50,500
and an argument and a fight that happens

518
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:53,920
and it's a function of legacy issues -

519
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,630
next question is also Gareth and we're

520
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,090
talking about frameworks international

521
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,730
frameworks actually I did some research

522
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:06,159
we have in the frameworks we have m.i.a

523
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:12,160
we have GD a GMP we have GP p in Canada

524
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:14,320
we have G AMC in so why is Carib is not

525
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,120
included or cannot be included in their

526
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,220
already existing international

527
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,529
frameworks which are in compliance

528
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,480
except actually and I think it's

529
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:26,470
starting to and you're starting to see

530
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,440
that movement for instance BRC that that

531
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,960
accreditation we just did that for the

532
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,460
first time so it's not that it couldn't

533
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,370
be done it's just that it hasn't been

534
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,690
done and I think GMP is one of those

535
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:40,509
things you're hearing a lot of the

536
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,210
buzzword of GMP all over the world in

537
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:46,269
the u.s. we've done a Jane Canada yeah

538
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,150
we've got a you have a TPP right G not

539
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:52,059
GMP and so I think you're starting to

540
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,490
see you know supply chains bridge those

541
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:59,079
gaps internationally for instance now we

542
00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:01,870
have to get a you EU GMP audit company

543
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,659
to fly to the United States to do the EU

544
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:07,449
spec GMP audit in order to be in

545
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,550
compliance in Europe and not just in the

546
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,039
US which is a different audit scheme so

547
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:16,000
I think that the industry is very young

548
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:17,559
but as it matures you're gonna see the

549
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,329
International frameworks come together

550
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,730
and start working the way that they

551
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:23,019
should it just hasn't been done yet and

552
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,329
I don't think there's anything

553
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:27,369
the industries from doing that for legal

554
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:28,480
products it's just it just takes time

555
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:31,389
for that to take place

556
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,579
if I could also add to that that's what

557
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,320
Garrett had said a lot of it in the

558
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:36,819
United States I think everywhere comes

559
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,409
from a lack of understanding of the

560
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:41,678
plant and all of this happens so

561
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:44,410
suddenly and so the current regulatory

562
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,679
frameworks that existed absent cannabis

563
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:50,769
don't fit cannabis so as an example the

564
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,990
FDA has a policy that's existed until

565
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,609
today whereby if something is a drug

566
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,859
it's not a food or a supplement right

567
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:59,109
and so then you have a pity elects which

568
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:01,299
went through as a CBD drug and so that's

569
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:03,519
approved as a drug so that would

570
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:05,589
according to the FDA I mean that

571
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,329
anything else that contains CBD needs to

572
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:10,058
be regulated as a drug and so the FDA

573
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:11,949
has expressed an intent to make an

574
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:14,019
exception in that regard because there's

575
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,670
so much CBD product out there and I

576
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:17,710
think everyone agrees that that would be

577
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:21,039
a bit silly so there's going to be some

578
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,710
sort of threshold which categorizes CBD

579
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,289
beyond that threshold of content as a

580
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,299
drug for perhaps that'll be a function

581
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:30,039
also of the usage of the CBD if it's

582
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,289
applied to a particular physiological

583
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:34,480
condition and then other forms of CBD

584
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:36,460
used for other purposes will still be

585
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,589
categorized as food and end as a

586
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,440
supplement and those are governed by

587
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:43,959
different tracks under the FDA so that's

588
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,019
it just goes to show that that the FDA

589
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,519
was not prepared to receive this type of

590
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:50,470
this type of subject matter the cannabis

591
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,970
subject matter and as a function of that

592
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,380
it's going to have to change some of the

593
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,970
habits that it currently has meaning

594
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,850
some of the policies that have existed

595
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,339
today thank you very much

596
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:04,029
my next question question goes out to

597
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:06,359
Francis we've heard that the who is

598
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,569
building up a regulatory framework for

599
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:11,439
Europe

600
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:14,349
we also heard in the long term the US

601
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,360
will set up a regulatory framework which

602
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:20,859
is which will be similar to the Canadian

603
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:23,979
or so what do you think how how

604
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:27,250
important is it that the European and

605
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:30,750
the authorities from oversea cooperate

606
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,669
so the business can prosper develop um

607
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,049
it's a good question and it's also

608
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,269
linked to what Tom was just saying

609
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,548
because the way

610
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:40,588
the FDA is approaching it and we're

611
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:43,378
you're anticipating the maybe the cutoff

612
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:45,298
between what's a medicine and what's a

613
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:46,648
food or food supplement I think the

614
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:48,959
European Commission are going to

615
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:50,968
legislate in the same way that's going

616
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:54,209
to come later on this year and that will

617
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:56,429
help to give clarity how it should be

618
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:59,278
how it should be approached and I think

619
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,099
be at a very high level between the u.s.

620
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,739
between the EU there are talks between

621
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:06,269
the two through two trading bloc's and I

622
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,069
think there will be a type of an

623
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:10,378
alignment that will come I'm

624
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:12,868
anticipating this it's my my crystal

625
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,848
ball okay so it's not written in stone

626
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:16,319
but this is I think what's going to

627
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:18,479
happen because there's too much at stake

628
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,178
there's too much at stake in terms of

629
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:23,249
tax dollars in terms of jobs in terms of

630
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,159
a whole new industry that's that's there

631
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:28,139
and that just needs to be freed a little

632
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,729
bit or given clear clarity and

633
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:38,488
regulations so it can go ahead yeah my

634
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:43,078
next question is - he - Keith and it's a

635
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:47,639
very specific question in Europe we have

636
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:50,690
a regulatory framework for seats what's

637
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:53,458
going on in the u.s. concerned about

638
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,859
hemp seeds a regulatory framework is

639
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:58,229
there anything planned now or is the

640
00:27:55,858 --> 00:28:01,918
NIDA and I DEA still importing seeds

641
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:04,159
from the in the US there is no framework

642
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,959
like the year there's no registered list

643
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,690
we need to remain compliant under the

644
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:13,499
federal guidelines of 0.3% THC or less

645
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:17,338
but outside of that you're free to do

646
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:20,759
genetics work and we do and I think that

647
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:24,418
you know the structure of the EU seed

648
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,889
list is is cumbersome especially for

649
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,679
folks that want to innovate and create

650
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:31,228
more farming and agriculture so I

651
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,649
believe that the the u.s. framework is

652
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:36,509
more advantageous for farmers and for

653
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:39,088
the market in general because it doesn't

654
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:41,338
have strict regulations and

655
00:28:39,088 --> 00:28:43,119
registrations related to the individual

656
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:48,409
seeds and genetics

657
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:52,789
thank you very much and let's go to the

658
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:54,769
novel food the novel food regulation and

659
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,750
my next question goes out to Francis

660
00:28:54,769 --> 00:29:01,579
about there because he's the expert on

661
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:06,250
novel food regulation and in the panel

662
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:08,750
before I estimated after the novel food

663
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:11,420
regulation is implemented it will take

664
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:13,819
another two up to three years till all

665
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,590
the national laws I implemented would

666
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:18,439
you agree or do we think there's a

667
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:20,480
difference not really over won't take so

668
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,640
long there has to be a harmonization

669
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,289
process that's true but it could be

670
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,560
accelerated it could be accelerated

671
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:30,289
because of the the changing economic

672
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:34,069
landscape and for sure the EU doesn't

673
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:36,740
want to be fall behind what's going on

674
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:38,539
in Canada and going on in the u.s. they

675
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,079
want to be competitive for sure and you

676
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:45,440
have an important lobby group the eih a

677
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:48,849
again which is receiving positive

678
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:54,710
feedback from the European Commission

679
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:57,049
and I'm hoping that it's at EU level I

680
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,759
think the clarification will come within

681
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:00,589
this year maybe towards the end of the

682
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,140
year but then when it gets translated

683
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:05,359
into the national laws is where it takes

684
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,860
time and that'll take another year but

685
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,959
as a person who has contact to

686
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:12,319
authorities you you've got the feeling

687
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,940
that he wants to be competitive yeah

688
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,189
they waddling sure

689
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,080
so it's not too much money involved it's

690
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,440
not like a black sheep know anymore no

691
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:23,449
they want to be competin yes okay um

692
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,000
thank you very much my next question

693
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,920
goes out to Tom and when we talk about

694
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,640
framework we also have to talk about

695
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,680
patents um how do different countries

696
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,560
protect from genetics and other aspects

697
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,320
of cannabis technolon of technological

698
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:43,129
value do you have any experience in that

699
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:45,189
in California already sure well there

700
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:49,400
are in the United States first of all

701
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:52,130
there's a funky sort of patent called

702
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,870
the plant patent which is a bit peculiar

703
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,390
to the United States so there are ways

704
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:58,819
to protect plant varieties in the EU and

705
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,080
in other parts of the world but as there

706
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:01,189
are in the States but in the United

707
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,869
States you actually have a particular

708
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:06,830
type of patent that is designed to

709
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:09,319
protect a strain a set of cannabis

710
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:11,779
genetics that are produced asexually and

711
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,629
so this has been it's it's this

712
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,069
historical oddity the the plant patent

713
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,420
exists the United States to protect a

714
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:19,129
better strain of rose for instance our

715
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,080
law firms uber Lawler's actually just

716
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,150
obtained what we believed to be the

717
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:27,369
second ever issued us plant patent for

718
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:31,280
cannabis strain which is pretty cool

719
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:35,359
fact admit so in in the United States

720
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:37,759
and the there are really a variety of

721
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,069
ways now to protect the technology

722
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,740
associated with the plant and as we move

723
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:44,869
forward in in terms of the cannabis

724
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,400
industry continuing to mature from an

725
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,379
illegal industry toward a legal industry

726
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,880
or corporate industry intellectual

727
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,680
property is going to intersect

728
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,410
increasingly with regulatory frameworks

729
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,430
like for instance the FDA so as an

730
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:00,019
example of that the to take it back to

731
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,799
the FDA for a moment and then the

732
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:05,150
comeback patents the FDA of course when

733
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,619
you think of the FDA and you think of

734
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,420
the approval process you think typically

735
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:10,939
of the drug approval process right like

736
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,800
a PDL X and that's a ten year process a

737
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,350
ten year plus process is a billion

738
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,159
dollar plus process typically and that's

739
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:20,929
that's that's a got it's a threshold

740
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,970
that really typically is only met by a

741
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,590
pharmaceutical company given the

742
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,690
enormous resources that a pharmaceutical

743
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:28,309
has a company has to throw at that type

744
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:30,950
of application process but there are

745
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:33,200
also two other tracks to oversimplify

746
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,569
things at the FDA that are gonna come

747
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,029
relevant to cannabis products you have

748
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:40,970
the NDI track which is for new dietary

749
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:42,859
ingredients and what that is basically

750
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,019
supplements right so supplements that

751
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:47,240
are not quite drugs so if you have a a

752
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:49,579
CBD product that you're using for

753
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,170
seizures like a PD LX that's a drug if

754
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:52,789
you have a CBD product that you're using

755
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,950
for better sleep that would be

756
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:56,990
considered a supplement and so typically

757
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,450
you would put that through the NDI track

758
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,880
the new dietary ingredient track at the

759
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,830
end of that track you could even get the

760
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,360
ability to make certain claims like

761
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:06,859
helps you sleep better or promotes

762
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,599
better energy and those are called

763
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,990
structured function claims there's a

764
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:11,250
third track

765
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,259
just called the crash track they

766
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,230
generally recognized the safe track so

767
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,629
that applies to foods like novel foods

768
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,630
you're in the in the European Union and

769
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,760
so that track also it takes about a year

770
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,590
like the NDI track and it's much less

771
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,029
it's in the low six figures maybe a

772
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,709
hundred one hundred and fifty thousand

773
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:31,349
dollars to get it through so those are

774
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,860
reasonable pathways and when you think

775
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:37,529
about CBD products THC products

776
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:39,000
CBN products these are typically aside

777
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:40,649
from topical creams and that sort of

778
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,289
thing they're all foods or supplements

779
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:45,110
or drugs so the FDA will govern

780
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:47,819
everything and so when we think about

781
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:49,229
when we think about patents the reason

782
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,808
that the way that they intersect with

783
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,640
the with the FDA processes is for

784
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:55,410
instance if you if you're successful in

785
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,450
obtaining an NDI approval for

786
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:59,580
supplements say a tincture that you're

787
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,220
going to use to help folks sleep better

788
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,639
at the end of that process in the United

789
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,130
States

790
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,110
others could ride the coattails of what

791
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,570
you've done so let's say that Francis

792
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:12,539
puts through an application with the FDA

793
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:14,519
he achieves an NDI approval he's got a

794
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,469
tincture now he can say it helps you

795
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,599
sleep better and he starts to put that

796
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:19,949
on the shelf I could come out and say

797
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,418
you know what I'm gonna do it Francis

798
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,888
did and I'm gonna go ahead and put my

799
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,289
product on the shelf and ride the

800
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,358
coattails of that well you can use

801
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:28,769
theoretically you can use patents and

802
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,599
other things to make it more difficult

803
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:32,820
for me to do that so let's say that

804
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,099
Francis's application were to rely on

805
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,720
particulars like for instance a

806
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,029
particular strain that he's patented

807
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,709
well then in that sense it's difficult

808
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,810
for me to do exactly what Francis has

809
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,159
done without infringing that patent and

810
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:45,989
so I think what you're going to see as

811
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,000
we go forward is a greater communication

812
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:50,189
a greater intersection between

813
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,500
intellectual property and FDA frameworks

814
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,450
I think also what we're going to see is

815
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,340
a bit of a reckoning so what folks may

816
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:59,579
not know out here in Zurich in the

817
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,680
European Union around Zurich in the

818
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,630
United States and California last July

819
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,889
90% of the product came off the shelf

820
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,700
I'm gonna say that again because it's a

821
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:11,849
phenomenal fact ninety percent of the

822
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:14,639
product in legal retail shops were taken

823
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:16,440
off the shelves last July why because

824
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,569
they didn't comply with regulations that

825
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,849
came down last July the amazing

826
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:23,460
phenomenon the the that's associated

827
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:24,130
with that fact is we all knew it was

828
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,079
going to

829
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,420
than anybody who thought about it last

830
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,479
January or February of March or April or

831
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,710
May understood that most of the product

832
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:34,899
was going to come off the shelves in

833
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,278
July when the regulations landed there

834
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,720
are some of us in the United States who

835
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:39,009
believe that sort of reckoning is going

836
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,209
to happen at the federal level in

837
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:45,519
relation to FDA regulations and and the

838
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,159
reason why is because it seems to me and

839
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:50,738
to others that the FDA has to regulate

840
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,420
any product that makes a claim that it

841
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:55,088
helps you sleep better or that it helps

842
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,849
you improve energy or that it improves

843
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:59,588
your gut or what have you because if it

844
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:01,479
doesn't then the FDA becomes a mockery

845
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:03,818
so many of these products that are

846
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:05,828
making these claims now there is going

847
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:07,298
to be some sort of reckoning at some

848
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:09,369
point and so it makes sense for

849
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:11,288
companies that look to enter the United

850
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:13,509
States to start thinking today about

851
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:15,220
becoming compliant tomorrow so that you

852
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:17,199
have that advantage that your one of the

853
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:19,808
that you're among that 10% or that 5%

854
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,578
that 20% or whatever that percentage is

855
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:23,229
that's compliant when the FDA decides

856
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,599
that they're going to regulate but rest

857
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:26,889
assured the FDA will regulate because

858
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,979
all of this stuff is food it's

859
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:32,739
supplements Grug thank you very much Tom

860
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:34,899
Garrett I felt you wanted to say you

861
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:37,119
wanted to add something Oh am I wrong

862
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,910
no he's exactly right and you know we

863
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,119
would advising our our brand partners to

864
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:46,239
lay off the claims stay away from claims

865
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,608
and in stay away from letters from the

866
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,528
FDA that you know they have sent them

867
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:53,858
out notifying folks that they're making

868
00:36:50,528 --> 00:36:55,838
claims that are unsubstantiated so take

869
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:59,400
a conservative route and wait for the

870
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:01,690
FDA guidelines food supplement or drunk

871
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,519
can you compare this situation to their

872
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,009
European situation Frances whatever

873
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:09,179
saying anyway yes yeah we have to wait a

874
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:11,769
little bit more to get the clarification

875
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:17,169
this within this year I hope to see that

876
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:18,669
at European level then as I said before

877
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,009
it's going to take time to translate

878
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:24,420
that into the national laws so it will

879
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:26,588
take time we'll take some time I like to

880
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,739
prefer to be optimistic and positive

881
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:32,710
about this because there is a there is a

882
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:37,539
lot at stake yeah absolutely

883
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:39,759
thank you very much and I look on my

884
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:41,829
something under Swiss level of course

885
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:44,858
where we are short on time here sorry

886
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:47,889
sorry because next month on the 13th and

887
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:51,818
14th of June all the cantonal chemists

888
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:55,630
are actually meeting with the federal

889
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:58,599
office in Bern to discuss CBD to discuss

890
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:01,599
cannabis extract CBD what to do in

891
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,298
Switzerland so you would also say Swiss

892
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,599
authorities want to be competitive

893
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:09,699
meanwhile they they they have to put

894
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,199
clarification as well they have to do it

895
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:13,449
to it so they're watching what's going

896
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,309
on in the EU because if you know on the

897
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:17,579
food the food area particularly there's

898
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:20,289
a there is a strong alignment between

899
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:23,289
Swiss legislation and EU legislation

900
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:24,699
also concerning novel foods and the

901
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,889
reason for this is because the biggest

902
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:30,130
export partner for Switzerland is the EU

903
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:33,459
so again it boils down to trade and

904
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,048
money taxes and I think one gentleman

905
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:36,308
earlier this morning said Switzerland of

906
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:38,619
the few countries that makes money out

907
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:40,899
of this whole business it's true so

908
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:42,849
thank you very very much I don't know do

909
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:44,798
we have any we have time we have time

910
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:46,809
yes we have time for a question or two

911
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:48,699
does anybody have a question I have a

912
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:51,189
question on the intellectual property I

913
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:53,139
mean how does it work like cannabis has

914
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:55,928
been decentralized for such a long time

915
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:58,239
it's always been kind of a open source

916
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:59,409
software for breeders and everything I

917
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,749
mean there's a couple guys who try to

918
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:03,729
hide some strains or seeds but usually

919
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:05,828
it just gets out and everybody's all in

920
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:09,308
the mix I mean you can't really patent

921
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:11,199
OG Kush or train wreck or bubba or

922
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:13,389
anything like that so i mean how does it

923
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:16,509
how do you decide that you own the

924
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:17,889
rights to a cannabis string sure I'm

925
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:19,778
happy to take that one first of all

926
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,459
that's such a big exciting question and

927
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:23,679
man I'm very interested couple days

928
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:25,538
answering it so I'll make a couple of

929
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,519
points here as succinctly as I can first

930
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:30,729
of all what you pointed out really is a

931
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:33,908
prior art problem right the cannabis

932
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:35,558
industry is so novel and strange and

933
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,818
wonderful for so many reasons one of

934
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:39,880
those reasons is that there was a

935
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:42,818
thriving illegal economy around cannabis

936
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,309
for decades right and so there's all

937
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:47,949
this information out there however it

938
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:49,749
was illegal so there's no prior art and

939
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:50,338
and when I use the term prior or what

940
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:52,318
I'm for

941
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:54,328
- is really all the stuff that's out

942
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,130
there that the Patent Office the US

943
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:57,900
Patent Office that analogous patent

944
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,759
officers throughout the world will look

945
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,880
at to determine if something comprises

946
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:04,400
an invention right and so when the

947
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,900
Patent Office sees something today

948
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,798
somebody puts through an application to

949
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:13,139
let's say obtain a patent for anything

950
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:16,199
with any product that has greater than

951
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:17,818
95% CBD content which is a patent that

952
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:19,650
for instance United cannabis Corp is

953
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:21,239
obtained the Patent Office doesn't know

954
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,548
what to do with that because they're not

955
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,409
aware that those products have existed

956
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:27,028
because everything was illegal there's

957
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:28,528
just no prior art out there and I don't

958
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:30,748
mean to pick on that patent that's not

959
00:40:28,528 --> 00:40:32,579
my point and it takes that that's been

960
00:40:30,748 --> 00:40:35,009
through a process of challenge and it

961
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:36,239
survived and and United cannabis Corp

962
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:37,920
deserves credit for obtaining that

963
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,380
patent but what I do mean to point out

964
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,239
is that what you're looking to really is

965
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,338
a prior to our question and in the

966
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,170
cannabis industry you don't have access

967
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:48,119
to the prior art that exists because

968
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,769
nobody was talking about the illegal

969
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,568
stuff that they were doing experimenting

970
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:53,518
with cannabis um so that's going to

971
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:54,958
change now one other thing that I would

972
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:57,868
point out is that the cannabis industry

973
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:59,159
is a technology industry period it's

974
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:02,130
just that the cannabis industry doesn't

975
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:04,348
realize it yet most of it but the patent

976
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,179
litigation is going to affect all of our

977
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:07,920
lives anybody who's here with the

978
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:09,479
cannabis product will be affected by

979
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,459
patent litigation in some way or another

980
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:13,228
the reason is because there's so much

981
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,879
technology in that plant and there's so

982
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:16,798
much technology that lies between the

983
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,318
plant and the human physiology that we

984
00:41:16,798 --> 00:41:20,579
don't yet comprehend and so many of the

985
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:23,159
patents said well there are a few

986
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:24,839
patents today that are celebrated but in

987
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,629
in my view and in the view of some of my

988
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:30,088
colleagues these patents are not

989
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,979
necessarily capturing the substance of

990
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,478
the technology that's inside the plant

991
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:36,149
in the sense that they're speaking to

992
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:38,009
isolated cannabinoids one of the things

993
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,619
that's so fascinating about the plant is

994
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:42,478
how complex the interaction is between

995
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:44,189
the different cannabinoids terpenes and

996
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:45,419
ballast and other bio chemicals in the

997
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:47,518
plant and the way that these

998
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,009
interactions between these bio chemicals

999
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:51,268
affect the degree to which different

1000
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:53,639
cannabinoid receptors within the human

1001
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:56,669
body take up a cannabinoid so as an

1002
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:58,828
example isolated CBD which is taken up

1003
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,298
by the cb2 receptor not to geek out too

1004
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:02,999
much I'll try and keep this as simple as

1005
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:03,840
possible is not is not really taken up

1006
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:06,839
that well

1007
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,090
so the reason why if you take a CBD

1008
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,980
product you give it to your mom or or

1009
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,240
your your grandmother and they say I

1010
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,519
don't feel anything that's not

1011
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,679
surprising because an isolated CBD

1012
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,750
compound does not get taken up well by

1013
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:20,789
the cb2 receptor however you add a bit

1014
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,070
of THC and all of a sudden the

1015
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:25,559
receptivity of the cb2 receptor to the

1016
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:27,360
CBD increases the entourage effect the

1017
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,099
entourage effect and and and that's

1018
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,960
really an understated way of putting it

1019
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:32,029
but that's true and the thing to keep in

1020
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,840
mind is that there are over a hundred

1021
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:36,990
cannabinoids in the plant

1022
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,880
there are many receptors in the human

1023
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:40,949
body that take up cannabinoids but we've

1024
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,590
only studied - we can only currently

1025
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:44,909
test for between 13 and 828 cannabinoids

1026
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,980
depending on who you ask and how you're

1027
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:48,629
counting so what that tells you is

1028
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,840
there's so much that we don't yet

1029
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:54,570
understand that technology is going to

1030
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,220
get patented and and that's going to

1031
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,740
we're going to start to see increasingly

1032
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:00,389
interesting patents speaking toward the

1033
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:01,889
interactions between cannabinoids

1034
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:03,539
terpenes ballasts and other bio

1035
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:04,789
chemicals in the plant the way that they

1036
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,440
interact with particular human

1037
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:10,170
physiological conditions and as these

1038
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,090
patents land they'll be enforced and all

1039
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,280
of us will be affected thank you for

1040
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,720
keeping it very simple and we can just

1041
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,210
add just a note on that we've actually

1042
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:23,609
just started the process on a we

1043
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:24,929
announced a 0.0% THC cannabis strain in

1044
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:27,870
conjunction with the University of

1045
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:29,969
Kentucky and that's under under the

1046
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:32,099
patent process at the moment so that

1047
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:34,799
speaks to the - the genetics and the

1048
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:37,699
plant side of that and not as much to

1049
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,810
the receptor and to the entourage effect

1050
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:43,319
thank you yeah if one more question

1051
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:52,679
instead I have one more oh yeah thank

1052
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:55,610
you just on the three components or

1053
00:43:52,679 --> 00:44:00,179
whatever that are registered under the

1054
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:03,570
novel foods Bach was it or catalog that

1055
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:07,730
was three and Todd yeah cannabis sativa

1056
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:10,590
L is defined as what the plant yeah

1057
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:15,929
that's a little bit ambiguous your eyes

1058
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:17,019
there are 63 variety 6969 for the common

1059
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:21,769
registry yeah

1060
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:26,949
but the plant itself is cannabis sativa

1061
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:29,809
L correct and that is not 69 varieties

1062
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:31,819
so just two things there's common

1063
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:33,139
registry which Garrett was referring to

1064
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:37,360
earlier in the EU

1065
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:40,730
so for crops and for consumer products

1066
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,160
you you have to use a plant that's

1067
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:47,480
listed on that registry for it to be

1068
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:49,609
compliant with EU regulations and that's

1069
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,340
why you have things like EU certified

1070
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:56,750
hemp because it's a hemp variety that's

1071
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:58,400
on that list but novel foods is another

1072
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,170
regulations a complete different

1073
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,000
regulation it has nothing to do with

1074
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,800
there's no there's no bridge between the

1075
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,650
two so when they talk about cannabis

1076
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,560
sativa L they talk about it as its use

1077
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:12,019
in food products and it talks about

1078
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:14,389
whether you can use the seed or whether

1079
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:17,230
you can use the leaf or the stalk or the

1080
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:19,579
root are the flower and and this is and

1081
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,880
the problem with the entry in the

1082
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:26,569
catalog is that it doesn't explicitly

1083
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,230
say some things to make it clear what

1084
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:34,730
you can use or what you cannot use so by

1085
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:37,699
absence it's it's it's quite ambiguous

1086
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,079
to understand what is meant by that this

1087
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:41,449
is the this is the problem that's

1088
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:47,119
linking with that entry into come in the

1089
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:49,210
in the catalog okay if fantastic great

1090
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,230
thank you all so very very much we are

1091
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:54,010
unfortunately out of time but that was

1092
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:57,748
very informative thank you very much

1093
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,749
[Applause]
