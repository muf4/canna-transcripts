okay so I'm going to start to sell it's

85
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:32,659
the global CBD crazy guys everything is

86
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,099
going around CBD everywhere so I want to

87
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:37,490
start out with the CBD market in Europe

88
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,349
is expected to be worth 416 million by

89
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,469
the end of 2019 this just came out in

90
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:44,389
rolling stone like seven days ago and by

91
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:46,580
1.7 billion by 2023 so what are you

92
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,889
seeing in terms of the best CBD

93
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,450
investments of the European market and

94
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:52,099
specifically in Germany and do you have

95
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,449
any thoughts on what investors should be

96
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,789
looking for in terms of CBD

97
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:59,929
opportunities so Jamie you want to what

98
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:02,840
do you think well that's a good question

99
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,450
the CBD companies that I'm seeing in

100
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,990
Europe were we're actually distributing

101
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:13,009
our CBD products in Europe and have been

102
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:14,659
for about three years so I have a little

103
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:17,870
bit of experience with it but what I'm

104
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:19,219
seeing is a big shift in the quality of

105
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,470
the companies that are coming forward

106
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,250
there's more of an advancement in tech

107
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,380
and if I were bringing my own capital to

108
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,290
the table I would be looking for teams

109
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:31,909
that are working cooperatively with the

110
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,860
German government the European

111
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,870
government to make sure that they're

112
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,060
gonna be able to have some long term

113
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,649
play because what we're seeing in the US

114
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,569
market versus what's happening in Europe

115
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:44,359
is that you guys are getting to learn

116
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:46,759
from our mistakes and I would be looking

117
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,790
for the teams that have spent some time

118
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,139
in the u.s. learning from those mistakes

119
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,050
and then are operating within the

120
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,269
confines of maybe driving the ship a

121
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,750
little bit because I think the companies

122
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:01,069
that are really instrumental in driving

123
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,660
legislations they're the ones that are

124
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,029
gonna make it because everyone else is

125
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,620
going to come behind and follow actually

126
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,659
that's that's a great answer I mean it's

127
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,420
definitely changing the face of

128
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,520
everything but it's also you know what

129
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,660
we see in the u.s. too is we have you

130
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,789
know some states that in act you know

131
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,740
CBD losses can I have an entry point for

132
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,030
that so what's really interesting to see

133
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,220
in Europe Alex what do you think about

134
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:24,049
this the CBD opportunities are happening

135
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,410
to Europe right now well clearly it's a

136
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,660
regulated environment and so investors

137
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,790
in general react to regulatory

138
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,278
industries with caution

139
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:37,829
so we seen this in the

140
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:39,598
kind of alternative energy market on the

141
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,999
wind side on the solar side all

142
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:44,728
regulated markets and I think what it

143
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:47,278
looks like CBD was a food novelty act

144
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:50,758
etc are going to be also in this

145
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:54,358
category it's all more open than THC I

146
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,879
would say but in general I think

147
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:59,308
uncertainty creates something what

148
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,549
investors don't like and therefore I

149
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:03,749
think in general caution you know

150
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:06,418
certainly this is a once-in-a-lifetime

151
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:09,899
opportunity because of the demand curve

152
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:13,618
actually being created so I think one

153
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,978
needs to balance both sides and without

154
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:18,319
any doubts I would say that actually

155
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:22,618
well-organized governments in Europe

156
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,769
which have a clear plan and give clear

157
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:29,429
guidance to entrepreneurs have a huge

158
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:31,379
advantage to create the diamonds which

159
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:34,258
are in the rough right now and I would

160
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:36,899
say that mostly it will have to start on

161
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,169
the medical side it will have to start

162
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:42,569
in a regulated environment and I think

163
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:45,418
when we look about on my way in Germany

164
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,309
right now the German government compared

165
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:51,778
to the Danish or others have given a

166
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:53,249
clear guidance what they want to do it's

167
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,288
going to be only a four year contract

168
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:59,299
but I would say these companies which

169
00:06:55,288 --> 00:07:02,788
are achieving a license are going to be

170
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:05,338
highly valuable and without any doubts

171
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:07,709
there will be huge amounts of capital

172
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:10,319
required to bring those companies to the

173
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:13,379
market we seen this in Canada how long

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,360
it took how long it took for patients to

175
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,729
develop I would say there's a slight

176
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,229
advantage here because many patients are

177
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:23,269
registered and I think there's a

178
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:25,498
familiarity was with a product and so

179
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:29,278
while one has as an investor has to

180
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:31,049
balance both sides yeah but uncertainty

181
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:32,848
is not certainly something and

182
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:34,618
regulation is not something investors

183
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:36,058
look forward to oh well certainly

184
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,889
there's a lot of uncertainty in this

185
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,329
industry and especially with how we're

186
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,619
just trying to educate our governments

187
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,718
and it's all about education and

188
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:44,309
awareness and more and more were able to

189
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:46,110
educate these governments on moving the

190
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:48,580
path forward and creating a mechanism in

191
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,169
which you know we're able to move

192
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:51,878
so you know what about what about you

193
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,978
Gavin what do you think about it so I

194
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,530
start with a couple of data points there

195
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:58,478
was some survey data from the UK which

196
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:00,579
suggested CBD had brand awareness of 50

197
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,990
percent and 10 percent of the population

198
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,769
had tried CBD so I think the first thing

199
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,939
to say this is a as a massive phenomenon

200
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:09,758
driven by word of mouth from the

201
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:12,490
consumers the second thing I'd build on

202
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,379
Alex's point to say the regulations are

203
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,759
shifting and that makes no investors

204
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,400
nervous it also makes entrepreneurs

205
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,389
pivot I've seen a bunch of folks in the

206
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,788
UK look at the recent EU FSA rulings and

207
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,168
move from food into cosmetics so I think

208
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:27,818
you'll start to see entrepreneurs look

209
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:29,198
for DIF like I guess regulatory

210
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,098
arbitrage is the way to think about it

211
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,538
they're going to be different regulatory

212
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:33,458
frameworks depending on the types of

213
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:34,658
products depending on the channels and I

214
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,609
think smart entrepreneurs will figure

215
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:38,019
out how to play that ARB game smart

216
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,399
investors will figure out which

217
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,509
entrepreneurs to back and I think

218
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,278
there's going to be a lot of opportunity

219
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:44,049
in the space but I think it's gonna be

220
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:45,700
quite fluid for the next few months in

221
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,838
Europe I think the big change is going

222
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,339
to be on the back of the farm bill I

223
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,810
think if the u.s. gets some clarity

224
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,459
around CBD I think it's going to be

225
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:53,289
incumbent upon Europe to look at that

226
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:55,899
and say actually we've got some clarity

227
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:57,219
now we can bring that to to the EU and

228
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,198
so one of the things that we're you know

229
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,149
fighting hard for is a you know

230
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:03,129
harmonized EU regulatory framework for

231
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,269
these products and I think the fact that

232
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,828
this is going to pass at the federal

233
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:07,089
level in the u.s. gives us a good

234
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:09,819
framework start talking about this stuff

235
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,529
in this way across the EU so yeah big

236
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,879
market it's kind of fluid at the moment

237
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:14,320
around the rig's entrepreneurs will

238
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,509
figure their ways around it I think

239
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,190
we'll get some clarity through the rest

240
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,799
of this year into next year as we look

241
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,600
to the experience of the US absolutely

242
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,979
agree with that you know and also you

243
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,690
know think that it's an important point

244
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,209
that either entrepreneurs or investors

245
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,529
need to be able to pivot at any moment's

246
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,000
notice based on their regulatory

247
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:33,220
framework I mean it's changing

248
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,778
constantly it's a moving target and we

249
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,310
like to call it dynamic compliance sort

250
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:38,049
of speak and so that's very very

251
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,719
important point you have to be able to

252
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:42,219
be used to that so speaking of different

253
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,050
opportunities besides the CBD are you

254
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,930
seeing any other opportunities here in

255
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:49,269
Europe besides CBD that seem like

256
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:51,639
they're worthy of investment you have an

257
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:54,730
easy thing obviously on the medical side

258
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,338
yeah I think it's fair to say it's grown

259
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,920
less quickly than people probably would

260
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,910
have thought I remember being here in

261
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,139
2017 and there was sort of real hype

262
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:03,639
around

263
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,750
as Alex said in the intro yesterday you

264
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,799
know there were only a thousand patients

265
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:10,299
in Germany and I don't think it moves

266
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,519
quite as quickly as people have thought

267
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:13,659
it still feels like we're in the sort of

268
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,730
less established the regulatory

269
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,959
framework for medical there's a lot of

270
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,330
infrastructure building happening

271
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,280
clearly the Canadians have sort of been

272
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,230
in looking at various different

273
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,269
opportunities there are some Israelis in

274
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,430
Europe they're clearly you know some

275
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:29,889
some European ox pros looking at the

276
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:31,029
space as well but it hasn't grown I

277
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,090
think from a sort of market demand

278
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,039
perspective quite as quickly as as we

279
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,899
thought and so there's still a lot of

280
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,000
risk capsule going in on the promise of

281
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,100
future revenues from the European market

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,299
but yeah aside from CVD that that's the

283
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,250
space that we're focused on right

284
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,409
license THC medicine production right

285
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,600
and Alex you have a pretty profound tech

286
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:51,339
background are you seeing any new tech

287
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
innovation in Germany specifically

288
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,149
there's worthy of investment that's you

289
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,660
don't have leading around the world or

290
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,909
anything like that

291
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:00,339
yeah I think two things to point out I

292
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:02,889
think investment and seems come in wave

293
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,500
so I think as a venture capitalist you

294
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,809
have seen this of the last 20 years it

295
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,090
was very unclear in Germany at the

296
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:11,739
beginning in 1998 what will happen was

297
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,629
the Internet but we have seen we're in

298
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,200
eventually caught up we created

299
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:19,389
companies in our own tough and and we

300
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,920
created them all around Europe yeah I

301
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:23,470
wouldn't say we have been as successful

302
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:27,779
as the United States because there were

303
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:30,910
early however I think in the patient

304
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:33,699
medical and doctor pharmaceutical

305
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:37,120
relationship there is a lot of lack and

306
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:42,060
slack I would say that we are at the

307
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,399
break out of formulating machines

308
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,969
software machines which can identify

309
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,429
much better

310
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:54,610
deceased profiles than any human doctor

311
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:57,219
and I think that's due to the intake of

312
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,169
information by by machines by software

313
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,710
machines on a machine learning side and

314
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:05,589
then by the input and in layman terms by

315
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:08,139
patients into a mobile phone and then an

316
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:11,070
analysis I mean one has to imagine the

317
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:15,059
human has we have around 7,000

318
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:18,000
identified diseases only 500

319
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,289
are treatable or have a medical product

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,129
against them and then if you look down

321
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:27,110
into a single disease it's often defined

322
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:30,360
and treated with like one pill or one

323
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:33,300
medication if you take autistic children

324
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:38,519
what we now know is that the DNA decides

325
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:40,229
much more about the treatment so I've

326
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,699
seen more and more companies which

327
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,659
coming from that perspective of saying

328
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,100
well first identify what you've got

329
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:49,259
better than the doctor because there's

330
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,800
more information then actually bring

331
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:55,379
those patients into a DNA test

332
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:58,500
define what the DNA tells you about

333
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:02,460
let's say autism and then define the

334
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:06,809
treatment strategy and that will give us

335
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:09,120
a a huge increase from 500 diseases to

336
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,679
seven thousand diseases laughs so six

337
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,919
and a half thousand we don't treat today

338
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,659
because they're so rare and and then on

339
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,370
top of it every single disease can be

340
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,189
treated in four or five different ways

341
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,889
depending of your DNA I mean all of us I

342
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,660
think have different effects on THC and

343
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:30,090
CBD and and you know it's and and that

344
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:33,839
has something to do with our DNA and how

345
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:37,050
we are made up and I think there you

346
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,820
have a huge potential going forward

347
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,409
which is much wider than I mean what

348
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,870
we're seeing in in this industry but

349
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:44,850
it's it's quite determined as well what

350
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,169
we're doing was THC or CBD products and

351
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,029
excellence there's a lot of pioneering

352
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:50,159
for different investment strategies with

353
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,740
different you know innovators in that

354
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,240
space that's really amazing so you know

355
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,669
I kinda want to move on to like raising

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,399
capital in some of these capital markets

357
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,349
so you know Canada obviously Canada is a

358
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,939
you know a leading country doing this

359
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,710
with with with the access to you know

360
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,990
public markets as opposed to the US or

361
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,550
other areas Jamie do you want to kind of

362
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,049
talk to us about how to raise capital

363
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:11,159
what that looks like and tell us a

364
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,990
little bit about the landscape please

365
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,789
bang is getting ready to go public on

366
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,220
the Canadian stock exchange in a few

367
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:19,829
weeks and that process has been through

368
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,500
an RTO which is a reverse takeover it's

369
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,110
been a long process we could have gone

370
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,409
IPO and we felt the RTO would take less

371
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,680
time but in reality it didn't even

372
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,149
though

373
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,309
we had a clean shell from a mining

374
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,320
company so what I would say to you if

375
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:36,659
you're out there going into the Canadian

376
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,940
market looking for capital just do your

377
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,370
due diligence and and be thorough about

378
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,670
that we had several companies come to us

379
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,320
with promises of extreme valuations and

380
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:48,750
different things going on and the

381
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,220
reality is if you know your company and

382
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,958
your value and your ability to generate

383
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,320
revenue you should have a pretty good

384
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,208
idea of what your valuation should be so

385
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,470
when companies come to you and they give

386
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,629
you something that doesn't make sense

387
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,600
you you really need to drive the ship

388
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:05,338
and say no that's not that's not where

389
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,750
we want to go because at the end of the

390
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:10,050
day you've got to offer your

391
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,028
shareholders real revenue real value and

392
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:13,500
you've got to know what that is but I

393
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:17,240
wanted to speak about what Alex was

394
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:20,190
talking about with the the technology

395
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,430
the plant that we're all talking about

396
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,800
in these rooms we don't know what it's

397
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:29,129
capable of healing what we all have is

398
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,919
anecdotal evidence that it does work and

399
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:34,830
it's working legitimately for people so

400
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:38,539
I just I'm excited about being part of

401
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:41,759
this industry for technology for healing

402
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:45,269
but what I would also like to see is a

403
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,009
real common-sense approach to the fact

404
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,470
that people are going to use marijuana

405
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:52,379
recreationally as well and that some of

406
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,350
that legislation has to happen I'm

407
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:56,789
hoping the Europeans get it right and

408
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,589
you know look at the taxation and look

409
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,179
at some of the frameworks around

410
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,220
allowing the plant to be used

411
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,449
recreationally and not just medically I

412
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,490
think that's one thing they can learn

413
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,150
from us and then the last thing I want

414
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:12,360
to say is the real commodity that I see

415
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:16,100
as a brand is shelf space and ultimately

416
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,440
the u.s. is screwing up we all know this

417
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,870
we can't scale up we we've got federal

418
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,380
illy it's federally illegal so I can't

419
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,000
build one manufacturing plant and move

420
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,679
my product across state lines

421
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,230
it means theoretically I would have to

422
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,778
build 50 manufacturing plants to be

423
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,519
animal a multi-state operator bang's

424
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,379
been able to get around that and when

425
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,659
you know through licensing and other

426
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:42,429
opportunities but at the end of the day

427
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:45,179
the companies that capture shelf space

428
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:47,139
that's the supply that's diminishing

429
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,759
because cannabis is going to become a

430
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,909
commodity and it's gonna be grown in

431
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,319
areas where the Sun is plentiful and you

432
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:55,240
know we're gonna be able to get back to

433
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,060
the the price of the commodity getting

434
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,269
low enough to us you know turning into

435
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:03,189
just a typical industry and

436
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,389
pharmaceutical quality medicine for

437
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,850
people who want medicine and

438
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,819
recreational quality medicine craft

439
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,828
cannabis and all of those things but at

440
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:13,990
the end of the day it's the the brands

441
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:16,088
that are going to matter and it's the

442
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,160
companies that are building brands that

443
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:20,279
are capturing the hearts and minds of

444
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,269
consumers and capturing shelf space

445
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,369
those are the ones that are gonna win

446
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:27,509
that's where I would be looking to put

447
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:30,639
my money obviously the bang brand is

448
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:33,190
strong and powerful but there's I think

449
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,950
the biggest ones don't exist yet just

450
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:38,289
like all the cannabis consumers that are

451
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,150
going to exist aren't in the marketplace

452
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:43,119
yet because we're we've got to you know

453
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,220
reach that point of social acceptance

454
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,529
you want to weigh your honor yeah this

455
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,289
brand point is interesting if you look

456
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:52,299
to the alcohol industry which also went

457
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:54,039
through a period of prohibition the

458
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:57,369
first brands that were built post

459
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,899
prohibition were were those brands that

460
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,259
established the functional attributes to

461
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,870
the category so in London

462
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:06,039
Gordon's gin was was was marketed on the

463
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:08,049
fact that it wouldn't kill you

464
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,539
and it wouldn't destroy your liver and I

465
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:12,190
feel like this first phase of cannabis

466
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,440
brands are almost normalizing this

467
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,299
product for the mainstream with a lot of

468
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,890
these functional attributes so you know

469
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:19,119
you're not going to get the munchies and

470
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,860
eat your whole kitchen you're not going

471
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,079
to have psychotic episodes or all of

472
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:24,909
these years of misinformation and I

473
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:26,710
think once those functional attributes

474
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,540
in the category are established then we

475
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,179
can start moving to aspirational brand

476
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:32,529
building so I think the most impactful

477
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,390
brands in cannabis are yet to be broke

478
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:37,210
yet the other thing I'd say on from the

479
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,009
alcohol perspective brands are built in

480
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,929
the on trade so brands in the alcohol

481
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:44,019
space not built in consumption venues

482
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:46,059
like bars like pubs we don't have those

483
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:48,460
spaces in cannabis right now and I think

484
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:50,799
it's going to be those countries that

485
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,259
regulate on the consumption side first

486
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,480
that will offer the most appealing brand

487
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:57,460
building opportunities for companies

488
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,808
there's a lot of ritual that is involved

489
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,460
with cannabis consumption that is yet to

490
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:03,129
be defined for the products that we yet

491
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,538
to invent and so we all know the ritual

492
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,789
when you you know go home and have a

493
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:08,710
glass of wine or for a smoker who goes

494
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:09,879
outside and I think those rituals are

495
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,130
going to be invented for cannabis and

496
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,809
the really smart brand market is will

497
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,700
tap into the psychology to work out what

498
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:17,079
those rituals are so a lot lots of

499
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,460
investment potential with the brands

500
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,308
that are yet to be built tapping into

501
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,569
trends that were yet to figure out

502
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:24,250
absolutely and I can absolutely relate

503
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:26,950
to that coming from the San Francisco

504
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,778
Bay Area which is you know ground zero

505
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,819
for the cannabis industry at from the

506
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:33,069
very beginning we're seeing a lot of

507
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:34,869
brands come out of California and of

508
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:37,240
course you know licensing the IP and

509
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:39,069
scaling by IP and scaling by footprint

510
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,109
is a methodology where you can cross

511
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:42,788
state lines or even cross country lines

512
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:43,928
you know just scaling by IP so I think

513
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:45,398
that's an important factor when you're

514
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,538
looking at some of these investment

515
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,219
strategies and whether or not the

516
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:50,319
management team is even focused on this

517
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,558
so that's that's really amazing

518
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,388
what about raising capital in Europe do

519
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,278
you have any insight on that Gavin on

520
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:58,689
how to raise capital in Europe how does

521
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:02,169
that look like or what is that landscape

522
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,058
look like yeah it's really changed in

523
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:06,820
Europe actually in the last like three

524
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:07,990
or four years on the back of you know

525
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,269
this was a domino effect of all these

526
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,048
countries legalizing medical release

527
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:16,808
putting in place frameworks and so you

528
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:18,099
know initially it was it was almost it

529
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,720
was almost difficult to talk about it in

530
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:21,099
somewhere like London you know how would

531
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,889
you approach someone to talk about this

532
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:26,138
specific topic in a space where in the

533
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:28,750
UK this was illegal until in November

534
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:29,949
last year in the last six months it's

535
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,690
really changed and you're starting to

536
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,210
see a lot more interest from the venture

537
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,730
capital community a lot more interest

538
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,340
from some of the larger investment banks

539
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,778
a lot more interest from the high

540
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,119
net-worth and family office space

541
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:44,679
I still feel we're in this space of sort

542
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,979
of educating a lot of the investors in

543
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:50,110
London it's quite unsophisticated I

544
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,610
think we've got a lot of education to do

545
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:54,398
on the Canadian public Marcus about the

546
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:56,558
metrics that really matter and and and

547
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:59,048
that has an impact on how investors in

548
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,819
Europe look at these opportunities the

549
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:02,259
other thing I'd say you know is I think

550
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:04,480
we can draw parallels here between the

551
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,528
tech industry in cannabis in that Europe

552
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,110
tends to be a little bit more

553
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:09,430
conservative when it comes to you know

554
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,349
valuations look

555
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,789
for entrepreneurs to get traction or an

556
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:13,990
understanding of unit economics before

557
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,430
they really want to scale a company

558
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,220
whereas I feel like there's a lot more

559
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,299
risk capital in North America so yeah I

560
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,069
think it's going to be an interesting

561
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:23,200
space for Europe over the next few

562
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:24,730
months and years as we start to see more

563
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,670
educated investors get into the space

564
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,019
with larger checks excellent Alex um you

565
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,550
have a distinguished career in venture

566
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,009
capital can you weigh in on some of that

567
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:34,269
between Europe and Canada and what is

568
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:37,180
what is like raising capital especially

569
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:41,069
for cannabis companies yeah I would say

570
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:44,110
it's it's unclear who are the structured

571
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:46,480
venture capital group's in that space

572
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:50,979
right now in Europe I would say there's

573
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:55,029
a lot of recycling of capital to to the

574
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:58,930
user success in Canada so the groups I'm

575
00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:01,710
working with in somehow had huge

576
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:04,299
successes in Canada have huge capital

577
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:11,049
available and they're willing to invest

578
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:13,599
it at very fast pace and so it is

579
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:17,049
unclear yet in Europe where to invest it

580
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,839
I would say it's much clearer right now

581
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,879
in other parts of the world I would say

582
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:28,529
the United States is still a fantastic

583
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:32,320
Roche market and so but I think

584
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:36,509
structured capital is needed and I think

585
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:39,189
at much bigger scale than people imagine

586
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:42,210
in a certain respect I calculate that

587
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:46,000
Germany would need about 1.5 billion of

588
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,220
investment to make the whole industry in

589
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,519
the country grown or grow up in the

590
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,900
country so that's my

591
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:57,759
back-of-the-envelope calculation now

592
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,009
when it comes to banks it's quite

593
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:03,400
interesting I have spoken to several

594
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:05,920
banks and so some Canadians are still

595
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,590
close to the idea of actually dealing

596
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,730
and and and having companies in their

597
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:14,529
structures which are cannabis related

598
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,170
while European banks are German banks

599
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:20,389
are sometimes much more liberal so you

600
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:24,890
go to the chief Ombudsman of the banks

601
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:27,740
and they have no problem actually to

602
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:31,759
touch that industry at all so in some

603
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,019
respect it's more liberal here then when

604
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,789
you speak to certain investors out of

605
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,589
the United States as well I suppose into

606
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,690
some investors in London and they just

607
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:41,689
say like well our pension funds don't

608
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:45,320
allow us and . end of story

609
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,630
yeah so I think it needs a special

610
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,819
approach for the next couple of years

611
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,200
and that's a challenger but at the same

612
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,059
time also an opportunity I would say

613
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,130
absolutely I mean speaking of banks I

614
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,929
mean the United States I mean really you

615
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,550
can't use an FDIC shirt and bank to get

616
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,110
loans or anything for cannabis based

617
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:01,819
business it's just not there yet now we

618
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:03,949
do have the safe banking act that looks

619
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:05,889
like it potentially may pass but this

620
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,210
has been a problem for entrepreneurs and

621
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,410
you know especially retail owners or

622
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,180
anybody that's in the cannabis space

623
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,560
because it's mainly been a

624
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,420
cash-and-carry business up into this

625
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,909
point now more and more we're seeing

626
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,310
this coming you know become more you

627
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,509
know accessible you know but because of

628
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,879
the compliance factors you're not able

629
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,559
to do that so it's it's been really hard

630
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,140
for the United States businesses scale

631
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,669
without private funding but more more

632
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,890
we're seeing family offices you know get

633
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,660
involved but that's part of the reason

634
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,940
why we're going to Canada as us-based

635
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,560
companies just to get that capital so we

636
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,700
can scale and grow within the United

637
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,159
States so that's a really interesting

638
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,930
concept but I think as we go forward

639
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,380
we're gonna see more and more this

640
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:48,470
access and being able to access this

641
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,340
capital domestically so but speaking of

642
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,620
which you know there's a lot of

643
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:53,629
companies out there in Canada that have

644
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:55,219
like really really high valuations and

645
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,200
we're seeing a lot of you know

646
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,539
opportunities coming to investors with

647
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,740
these these blown evaluations that you

648
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,899
know you can't support those valuations

649
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,099
and so what are you guys seeing in terms

650
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,230
of that and you know in terms of

651
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:07,699
deciding on that and and how do you guys

652
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,589
make the investment decisions on those

653
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,660
valuations in terms of investing in

654
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:14,599
those companies you want take it Jenny

655
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,840
what do you think it's an interesting

656
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,879
topic that gets bounced around a lot

657
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,859
especially at these conferences because

658
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,270
people are saying to me knowing that

659
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:24,649
we're getting ready to go public what do

660
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:27,200
you think about all the valuations in

661
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,300
Canada aren't they all inflated aren't

662
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,620
isn't everything we just talked in the

663
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,269
green room don't you think people are

664
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:33,319
gonna lose a lot of money coming up

665
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:35,500
pretty soon

666
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:38,450
because of these overinflated

667
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,619
evaluations I didn't I don't know I

668
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,480
don't know I don't have a crystal ball

669
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:44,179
because then when I look back at the

670
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,910
tech industry the companies that made it

671
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:50,960
I remember thinking wow they want $3 for

672
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:54,529
Amazon and we I don't know what's gonna

673
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,630
happen so it's interesting what I will

674
00:25:54,529 --> 00:26:00,109
say is I think when banking when that

675
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,690
domino falls in the US it's gonna be a

676
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:03,799
game-changer again because just in the

677
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,320
in the years that I've been in the

678
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,369
industry I'm from Montana we have a

679
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,589
saying if you don't like the weather

680
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:10,969
wait five minutes I feel like it the

681
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:12,169
same thing in the industry if you don't

682
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,460
like the way the industry is rolling

683
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,550
wait five minutes and there's gonna be a

684
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,100
new law but I think once banking falls

685
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:21,589
that domino and we can Bank like every

686
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:23,089
other industry then the dust is gonna

687
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:25,250
settle and we're gonna start to see the

688
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:26,629
real money come in so I think he's right

689
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,490
that the real money the big

690
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,800
institutional funds they're not here yet

691
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,690
we've had a couple of people dabble you

692
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,849
know Cronos got a big investment we've

693
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,380
we've seen you know some of the alcohol

694
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:38,990
companies and the tobacco companies

695
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,580
bring real dollars but those aren't

696
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,559
actually real dollars I think the real

697
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:44,899
dollars are coming and it's gonna take

698
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,099
banking for that to happen absolutely I

699
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,780
mean like we haven't even seen Wall

700
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:48,949
Street jump in or any of these big

701
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,450
groups come in or what do you think

702
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,430
about this Gavin about the valuations

703
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,960
aspect of these companies and things

704
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:57,140
like yeah I think it's interesting I can

705
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,759
believe the Canadian valuations if you

706
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,430
think they're going to dominate global

707
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:02,990
cannabis in perpetuity if you think

708
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,640
there's going to be competition these

709
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,490
numbers look inflated and that's the

710
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,930
only way that I can see it I think that

711
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,519
the interesting point on banking is

712
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,950
going to be right now there's a discount

713
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,720
applied to US stocks traded on the CSC I

714
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,759
think the moment this changes the

715
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,799
banking question these valuation these

716
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,359
multiples will all change the risk

717
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,639
profile for the US companies becomes a

718
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,339
lot safer the ability of the Canadians

719
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,990
to compete lacking this u.s. competition

720
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:28,909
disappears and I think there's a really

721
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,559
inflection point on on some of these

722
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,630
multiples that'll come on the back of

723
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,769
further us let it legislative change

724
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,290
it's interesting to look at how this is

725
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:41,420
impacting on Europe though because a lot

726
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:44,720
of the story that is promised right now

727
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,610
in Canada is around global growth and so

728
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,039
we sort of need to see these European

729
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:49,589
markets

730
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,690
move for the Canadian valuations to be

731
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:52,980
justified so I think some chickens are

732
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,600
going to come home to roost over the

733
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,309
next few months as we start to see you

734
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,169
know real data coming out as to the

735
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,369
actual size of the market and it kind of

736
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,050
feels like what we really need to be

737
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:03,119
talking about is demand generation in

738
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,950
Europe which is a tough tough question

739
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,239
speaks to some of the points Alex was

740
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,350
making around some of the future of

741
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,089
medicine in the future the clinical

742
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,529
trial but it requires all of us to

743
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,149
engage with healthcare regulatory

744
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:14,069
agencies the medical establishment to

745
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,450
make these markets move to have any

746
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:17,849
chance of these evaluations being

747
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,049
justified absolutely I totally agree

748
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:20,879
with that I mean Alex what do you think

749
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:22,829
about a couple evaluations and how that

750
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,410
how that's being evaluated based on

751
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:26,730
somebody's inflated your companies that

752
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,460
are doing it I mean it's based on hype

753
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,289
you know mainly what do you think yeah

754
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,269
I'm very cautious because I've seen it

755
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:37,079
over the 20 25 years I'm in this

756
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:39,779
industry on the tech space in a Crow's

757
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,939
industry it's very hard to value a

758
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:47,700
company because you have the PE G ratio

759
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:50,460
and so yes they look high but I would

760
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,980
say you have to be careful you know like

761
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,769
you have seen that I've seen that on

762
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,599
facebook when Zuckerberg mark was

763
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,849
running around Davos was 2 billion

764
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,759
valuation while myspace at twice the

765
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:03,689
numbers of users and sold for 6 700

766
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,359
million yeah

767
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,690
so I saw it was Larry and Sergey and

768
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:11,669
Google tiny companies others have tried

769
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:14,519
search out a Vista etc

770
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:17,240
don't underestimate gross you know and I

771
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:20,250
think if a market is growing a lot of

772
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,799
mistakes can be for bid I can be just

773
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,240
forgotten and companies can grow up and

774
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,669
at the end of the day it's paper money

775
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,859
and they these companies using that

776
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,750
paper money to go into markets and

777
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:33,899
Germany for example will be a gigantic

778
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,720
market we will see a million patients

779
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:40,680
maybe more consuming 2 to 3 grams per

780
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,630
day it's it's a 5 6 billion dollar

781
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,789
industry so you can create let's say 10

782
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,590
times multiple create in Germany 60

783
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:49,859
billion market cap on the stock market

784
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:51,899
alone and if you take the Canadian

785
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:54,179
companies jointly I mean sure they have

786
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,519
high market caps maybe they're three

787
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,890
times over valued like an Aurora and I

788
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,359
was doing three million revenue

789
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,509
give them three billion market cap but

790
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,028
it's a gross story so I wouldn't bet

791
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:08,009
against them I mean you have to be very

792
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:11,099
careful if you want to show those these

793
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:14,058
businesses and I've seen that screw out

794
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:16,349
and clearly people will definitely

795
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:18,259
decline in value some some of these

796
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:20,849
companies which make strategic mistakes

797
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:22,769
some of them won't get licenses where

798
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:24,990
they want to get the licenses there will

799
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:27,418
be cautious in terms of acquisitions and

800
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,278
then they will fall to the wayside but

801
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:34,080
that's the process of a next two three

802
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:36,119
four or five years ten years so but I

803
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,548
mean we are not here to actually bet for

804
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,379
stock market companies which already

805
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:42,359
floated we're here to build companies

806
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,028
absolutely from the base and the ground

807
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,038
up and I think yeah that's absolutely

808
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:48,690
possible excellent that's that's a great

809
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,429
answer so I'm speaking of you know

810
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,320
public companies let's let's talk about

811
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,240
the difference you know or you know

812
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,500
private versus public you know let's

813
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,149
just talk about that was this discussed

814
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,369
the difference and how companies seeking

815
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:01,349
investment decide on which investment

816
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:03,449
partnership to go with you know what's

817
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:04,859
best for them strategically from a

818
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,288
partnership perspective from a brand

819
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:08,548
perspective from a growth perspective

820
00:31:06,288 --> 00:31:09,509
was his talk about that a little bit

821
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:10,769
what do you what do you think Jamie

822
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:13,710
about the difference between those two

823
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:15,690
and how you approach that we discussed

824
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,788
it a lot at bang when I first started

825
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:20,009
working there we weren't really looking

826
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:21,869
to go public but we just cut having

827
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:24,240
banks come to us and say we we think you

828
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:26,819
guys will be great as a publicly traded

829
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,950
company we want to take you public and

830
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:31,408
we saw them looking at us as an

831
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,679
opportunity which caused us internally

832
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:36,750
to start having a different conversation

833
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,850
and what I would say is the the beauty

834
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:41,519
of private money is you can make private

835
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:44,189
decisions you can make mistakes and

836
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,379
everybody isn't you know looking under

837
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,210
your skirt but when you're public

838
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,309
everybody knows everything as they

839
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,960
should the public is putting money into

840
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,069
your company and they need to know what

841
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,380
you're doing they don't need to know

842
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:58,079
what your vision is and it forces you to

843
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,320
flesh out your vision it forces you to

844
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,629
get your strategic plan in place and

845
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:06,658
have some discipline that you don't have

846
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:11,580
to have when you're private so we saw

847
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:13,830
going public as a multi fold reason

848
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:17,579
to make our company better and one was

849
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:19,740
we have so many devoted fans that write

850
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:21,779
to us and ask how do I invest I love

851
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,120
your product your chocolate changed my

852
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:27,420
life kind of thing and so there was just

853
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:29,399
a part of that notion that Scott wanted

854
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,220
to open it up to the people that have

855
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,769
built our company so there was sort of

856
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,980
an altruistic decision in the background

857
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:39,900
and also we don't want to be afraid of

858
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:44,430
having people look at what we're doing

859
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:46,740
bangs been a trailblazer we've we had

860
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,840
the first nutritional fact panel on an

861
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,299
edible product before we sold one

862
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,669
product we had Lloyd's of London product

863
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:56,069
liability insurance before we sold one

864
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,900
product and at that time you know you

865
00:32:56,069 --> 00:33:01,470
were buying brownies out of Ziploc bags

866
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:04,410
so we brought that sort of regulation to

867
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,940
the industry so we we look forward to

868
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,400
the challenge of having people look up

869
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,009
our skirt because we've been operating a

870
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:13,170
really clean company for a long time so

871
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:14,849
I think that those are the that's the

872
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,110
rub do you want to make your decisions

873
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:18,839
in private or do you want to make them

874
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:21,779
in public and some companies don't want

875
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,769
the dilution that comes with you know if

876
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,210
you're an owner and you've built a

877
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:26,700
company and you go public you're gonna

878
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,319
give up some of your equity there's some

879
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,400
of that that you have to think about but

880
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:35,639
I think a small piece of a giant company

881
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:39,090
is just as valuable as a large piece of

882
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:42,620
a smaller company and so private capital

883
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:45,389
also allowed us to expand you know into

884
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:46,889
you know global markets and and we want

885
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,990
to dominate the globe we want to bring

886
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:52,080
our brand to the globe so how do you do

887
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:53,519
that with private funding there's lots

888
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,129
of high net worth individuals out there

889
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,480
that could have helped us go that route

890
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:00,450
this seemed like the right decision for

891
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,970
us yeah I mean I totally can agree with

892
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,920
that and I also think that it's the

893
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,799
difference of your business model - so

894
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,050
in my case you know i-i've just lost

895
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,429
technology you know a piece of software

896
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,900
SAS based software that helps with

897
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,699
permitting licensing and accelerates the

898
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,220
process I did the same thing with the

899
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,659
Vancouver you know met a group who was

900
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,849
you know a mining company they wanted to

901
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,639
relist on the CSC but instead of an RTO

902
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,239
what I did was instead was a qualifying

903
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,730
asset

904
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,618
transaction to help them relist which

905
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,168
doesn't require the five-year financial

906
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,820
audit and you know based as a campus

907
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,500
company in the u.s. even as a consulting

908
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,260
company was very difficult to find

909
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,030
someone or a company that would you know

910
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,740
basically do a five-year audit on us and

911
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,240
put their name on it so instead we did a

912
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,099
qualifying asset transaction which

913
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,500
allowed them to relist so it's just a

914
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,389
different methodology and for us we

915
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,940
needed access to public markets do get

916
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,769
access to this capital for opportunities

917
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,840
coming through our network so in the

918
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:56,280
case of JB's it's just scaling and

919
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,840
scaling the business is scaling the

920
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,850
brand and ours we just needed access to

921
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,350
that public public marketplace I mean so

922
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:03,179
it's just different ways of doing that

923
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,710
which i think is quite interesting to

924
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:06,118
see what what do you think Alex I mean

925
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,710
what is would your opinion on private

926
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,340
versus public like and some of the well

927
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,500
I think in the last year's - - I think

928
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,660
the large funding available for

929
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,309
companies company have chosen to stay

930
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:20,399
private much longer in this sector

931
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,960
however - - and I think not enough

932
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,340
investment people have chosen to go

933
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,800
public early and being a public board

934
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,070
member for ten years it's a huge burden

935
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,200
and it's a very expensive exercise to be

936
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,030
public company and for bid you decide

937
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,669
you want to go private I mean that's a

938
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,330
lengthy process and if you've gone

939
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:45,769
through that that's that's what painful

940
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:48,358
go there public - private again now I

941
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:50,579
would say a lot of these companies go

942
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,980
prematurely and if there would be more

943
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,869
capital available on the private side

944
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,659
people would choose to stay much longer

945
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:00,930
on the private side and we have seen

946
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:03,449
that in the tech space happening and I

947
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:06,000
think but right now I think people don't

948
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:08,219
have another choice it's a gross marker

949
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,590
people are hungry and so people go

950
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:12,329
prematurely to the stock market and I

951
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,539
think there will be a lot of shakeout

952
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:18,659
and a lot of people won't be able to

953
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:21,090
handle it properly so my choice would be

954
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:23,699
to stay private longer until you're much

955
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,320
larger company and then on top of it

956
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:26,849
what do you gain from being a public

957
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,550
company a lot of companies which went

958
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:34,049
public even I mean in Canada they didn't

959
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:36,220
have any float so the founders they have

960
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:39,190
nothing from this IP

961
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:41,469
you can't do anything with a stock and

962
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:44,320
and you're lucky one of the bigger ones

963
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:47,709
buys you so I think it's a balanced

964
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,010
approach you have to look at it clearly

965
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,079
some early ones will be winners but you

966
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:55,330
might be a big big loser being too early

967
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,549
public so I would say it's much better

968
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:00,299
to work with a consortium of investors

969
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:03,039
which you can trust which on your board

970
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,289
which you can work the process and you

971
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,420
get into a stable situation to take the

972
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,619
company's public and I mean in Germany

973
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,130
we have a long history of companies

974
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:16,150
which are hundreds of years old and they

975
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:17,320
have never gone public and yeah hey

976
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,180
Gavin do you want to weigh in on a

977
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,480
little bit yeah I think it's probably

978
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:25,119
worth remembering that it was sort of

979
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,289
speculative mining index in Canada let's

980
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,679
had a lot of the funding of this

981
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:31,119
industry early on and it was a point in

982
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,379
time when there was a lack of access to

983
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,789
capital and I think that's really

984
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,010
changing now so I think we will see

985
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:38,110
companies stay private for longer in

986
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,880
Europe as they're building out we do

987
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,400
however have a couple of companies that

988
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,160
have listed in London on the next

989
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,990
exchange so in much the way the CSC has

990
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,909
started to gather a reputation around

991
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:50,529
being a place where companies can go get

992
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:52,449
liquidity I think the necks in London

993
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,370
will start to become that sort of place

994
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:56,559
so there's sativa and our investments on

995
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:59,619
the next I've spoken to a m-- in London

996
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,449
about potential paths to liquidity for

997
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,889
companies in the future and then we have

998
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:04,019
a you know Stella Cara in Denmark you

999
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:06,699
know you're starting to see some

1000
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:08,800
companies in Europe emerge and look to

1001
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:10,599
public markets for capital rather than

1002
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,880
rather than private but in general I

1003
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,110
think I'd echo both points that you know

1004
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,420
we're going to make mistakes in this

1005
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:19,030
industry the regulatory frameworks are

1006
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:22,090
going to evolve and it's I think better

1007
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,500
to adapt to a business in private what

1008
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,990
while you're in this quite fluid space

1009
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,099
where where things are being figured out

1010
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:29,169
excellent excellent so I'd actually like

1011
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,670
to open up or you know some questions

1012
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,519
because I know I'm sure you guys have a

1013
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:35,380
lot of questions for us so let's get

1014
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,389
started on some questions once again for

1015
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:45,380
the panel first of all this way

1016
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:47,299
a very very exciting thank you very much

1017
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,910
this question is principally directed to

1018
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,980
Alex you talked about governments

1019
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:53,690
needing to give a clear planning

1020
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,429
guidance to entrepreneurs to make the

1021
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,220
right decisions could you focus a little

1022
00:38:55,429 --> 00:39:01,359
bit on which governments in Europe in

1023
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:04,189
your opinion have the highest chance to

1024
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,440
fulfill this requirement focus a little

1025
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,139
bit on Switzerland which my humble

1026
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,480
opinion seems to be on the forefront in

1027
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:15,400
many of the developments and the sub

1028
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,400
sectors you would put your money to work

1029
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:28,820
please be brief well very difficult

1030
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:32,809
questions I think and very hard to

1031
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:35,390
answer I would say it's um

1032
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:38,630
I mean I'm biased so let's put it that

1033
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:41,900
way I'm very biased for Germany because

1034
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:44,300
I'm German and I think I've seen it in a

1035
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,599
lot of industries I think we're slow but

1036
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,970
we will get to the point and when we get

1037
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,079
to the point we'll do it I think

1038
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:58,069
correctly and and then it will be a huge

1039
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:03,710
success so I would say what I see so far

1040
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:05,660
it's Germany but yeah so I mean we're in

1041
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,630
a single market we're free you know so

1042
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:11,599
others might have a chance as well I

1043
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:14,690
just feel that from an organizational

1044
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,739
perspective and curiosity this market is

1045
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:21,320
highly educated I think they are open

1046
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:24,139
for a change and they are open also to

1047
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,760
adapt new products to confirm the

1048
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:27,769
consumer perspective the pharmacies

1049
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,450
already the doctors are much more ready

1050
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:34,579
than anywhere else like it compared to

1051
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:36,349
England and it's a clear path I mean

1052
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:40,099
politically maybe not everybody wants

1053
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:42,139
that to happen but I think when people

1054
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:45,110
see the positive sides and this has to

1055
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:49,569
be coupled with with research R&amp;D and

1056
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:50,890
and and and more medical studies etc I

1057
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,869
think

1058
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:55,778
we'll get there that's my opinion but

1059
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:57,130
this is biased and I think I'm not fully

1060
00:40:55,778 --> 00:41:01,028
in a hundred and informed about

1061
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:02,588
everything in Europe and so a lot of

1062
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:07,230
people in the audience may might have a

1063
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:10,170
lot more knowledge and I have so yeah

1064
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:12,818
hey great panel thank you very much

1065
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,900
right here okay and thank you also for

1066
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:15,730
saying what you did about the German

1067
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,980
market because I'm I worked with the

1068
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,619
startup here in Germany medpay Rx and

1069
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:23,740
we're getting a lot of support but my

1070
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:25,480
question to you is twofold and I kind of

1071
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:27,219
bring back one of the themes that you

1072
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,960
talked about earlier a here in Germany

1073
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:30,639
obviously the regulatory markets are a

1074
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,500
little bit tougher

1075
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,420
I live in Frankfurt you know what a

1076
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,088
Deutsche Bursa has this entire industry

1077
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:41,048
from North America under super secret

1078
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:42,068
probation basically and that has to do I

1079
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:43,599
think with the maturity of the

1080
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:46,329
industries you were talking about but

1081
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,670
what do you guys see and and I'm sort of

1082
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:52,390
trying to get elicit your comments and

1083
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:54,278
helpful suggestions about how American

1084
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:56,798
and Canadian funds are getting

1085
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:58,389
information about the opportunities here

1086
00:41:56,798 --> 00:42:00,880
I mean this being Germany there are

1087
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:02,588
incubators there are accelerators

1088
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,750
there's government money if you're

1089
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:06,308
looking at it from science and most of

1090
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:10,239
the investors I know and talk to you are

1091
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:12,940
delighted to have that opportunity that

1092
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:18,129
was it what do you see in America about

1093
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:22,108
that any question what do you guys know

1094
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,108
who was that directed toward Marvel I

1095
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:30,068
would say like look I think you look at

1096
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:33,489
this conference it's still early days I

1097
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:35,349
can't see the usual suspects here so

1098
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:36,848
they're not here they're right now in

1099
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:39,400
the office or somewhere else and I think

1100
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:43,660
they will show up in this industry or

1101
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,778
one creates new essentially investor

1102
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:50,618
types what I see at the moment is people

1103
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:52,329
recycling their capital and trying to

1104
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:55,298
jump into this once-in-a-lifetime

1105
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:59,079
opportunity it doesn't happen often but

1106
00:42:55,298 --> 00:43:01,179
this industry I think is ripe and has 30

1107
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,630
years in front of it and you can invest

1108
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,989
into it and you can build step by step

1109
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,240
and

1110
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:10,089
a lot of very very good companies will

1111
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:12,939
be created in this industry a lot I mean

1112
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:17,470
a lot of employment a lot of taxable

1113
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:19,750
income so it's absolutely worthwhile to

1114
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:22,319
be here and and and discuss it with all

1115
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,719
of you and it's going to grow up it's um

1116
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,460
it's it's yeah that's what I see but

1117
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,109
right now I think the capital in this

1118
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,460
market needs to be convinced and

1119
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:36,670
recycles out of the Canadian market out

1120
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:39,639
of the American market and I think right

1121
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:43,059
now what I see is a Canadian investing

1122
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:45,969
into the American market next so we will

1123
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:49,690
see a lot there and then I think we will

1124
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:53,049
jump to Europe so we will have we have a

1125
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:55,720
bit of time still and as things become

1126
00:43:53,050 --> 00:44:02,440
clearer good management teams become

1127
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:05,439
clearer good strategies etc so yeah from

1128
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:10,000
the American perspective that's why I'm

1129
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,460
here you know I'm I'm curious for

1130
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,500
banging about what's happening in the

1131
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,199
European market so I'm finding out about

1132
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,780
things like your program incubators and

1133
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,719
things by basically getting out of the

1134
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:27,940
office and putting myself out there

1135
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:30,579
meeting people and this is my second

1136
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,409
year at ICBC Berlin I made some

1137
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:34,690
strategic partnerships here last time

1138
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:36,608
and that's why I'm back because it was

1139
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,440
effective if you want to meet the people

1140
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:41,679
who are doing things you've got to go

1141
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,619
meet them there isn't information I

1142
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:47,199
would tell you though I would not know

1143
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:51,190
about you Marguerite if I hadn't come

1144
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:54,339
here last year so to your point there
