00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,660
to me Europe represents the vanguard of

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,219
the candidates industry in the United

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,410
States and Canada we have a more

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,519
developed industry in Europe just

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,649
getting started

7
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,809
but the opportunities here and the

8
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,279
market here are enormous it's wonderful

9
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:30,009
to be here with a whole group of people

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,270
from all around the world interested in

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,499
furthering their involvement in the

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,019
cannabis industry and meeting new people

13
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:39,978
making new connections it's wonderful to

14
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:43,369
be here with a whole bunch of

15
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:44,448
like-minded kindred spirits interested

16
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:52,488
in advancing the cannabis industry

17
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:54,978
globally ICBC Zurich essentially the

18
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:56,780
first large international cannabis

19
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:58,219
conference that's ever happened here and

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,408
based on the local programs there's a

21
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:02,088
lot of opportunities for producers but

22
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:04,010
knowing all the international markets

23
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:05,989
how they relate with each other how

24
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,399
pharmaceutical import-export production

25
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:08,868
standards need to happen these are the

26
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:10,700
things that a lot of companies and

27
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:13,159
countries and investors need to know

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,478
about and to actually have a good source

29
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,030
of information from people who've been

30
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,978
in the industry for 10 plus years and

31
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,590
seen Canadian programs u.s. program

32
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,718
those 19 other countries importing or

33
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,310
here mostly raising capital deploying

34
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:28,099
capital and then also finding new

35
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,539
projects to start and invest into

36
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:35,129

ICBC has now done a glorious job in

38
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:40,289
berlin for years in Spain in Switzerland

39
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,000
in Canada and the United States it's

40
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,590
that one moment that what's happening in

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,118
the local market with what's happening

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,829
in the international market get to meet

43
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,620
and the opportunities that happen here

44
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:53,849
are once-in-a-lifetime

45

my name is marco i run a company called

47
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,129
highlight media were located in zurich

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,469
switzerland exactly where this

49
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,780
conference is happening right now myself

50
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,288
and my company highlight media we

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,300
attended a lot of different events in

52
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:18,000
the cannabis industry and the ICBC

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:21,390
really stood out so far because the

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,039
networking that you can do here is worth

55
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:25,259
a lot more than what the tickets are

56
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,329
costing so I think you should definitely

57
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,799
make sure to attend if you want to get

58
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:37,400
something done in the cannabis industry

59
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:39,500
