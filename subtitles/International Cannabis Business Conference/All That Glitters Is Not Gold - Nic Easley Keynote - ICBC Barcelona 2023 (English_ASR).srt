34
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,819
what a world that we actually get to be

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,920
here three years ago this was canceled

36
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,319
for a big deal I'm like now we're back

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
together in a room so uh very excited to

38
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,158
share a couple things about the global

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,280
cannabis industry

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,280
um

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,859
let's see

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,240
is this here we go almost Randy back

43
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,920
there he's actually the man who's

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,118
amazing

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,159
um

46
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,519
well I'll just get started good to go

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,520
Randy

48
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,299
nice

49
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,618
there's too many emojis in there

50
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:05,118
especially uh

51
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:05,118
yeah you'll see here momentarily

52
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,980
all right well I'll get started with a

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,659
little bit so we're in Spain which is

54
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,899
kind of interesting because you think

55
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,759
about 500 years ago places leaving

56
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,920
Europe to go and look for new resources

57
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,959
around the world and what we're starting

58
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,579
in other countries is now going to be

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,759
coming back to here so it's almost the

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,860
reverse of things about 500 years ago

61
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,299
so back in the day let's go look for

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,099
gold let's go find all these amazing

63
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,860
opportunities right because Europe

64
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:38,959
people have been here for a long time

65
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,800
opportunities are kind of sparse

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,259
civilization's been going on for a while

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,300
and there's not very not very common

68
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,719
that a new commodity or a new business

69
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,700
will just pop up and change a nation or

70
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,979
the world and that's pretty much what

71
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,018
we're doing here now a little disclaimer

72
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,598
I just have to always start I'm not a

73
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,300
lawyer I'm not a CPA I'm not a financial

74
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,859
analyst use professionals if you're

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,840
going to get into this space I've been

76
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,239
in the Cannabis industry for over 16

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,920
years and without good lawyers without

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,439
good accountants you are completely

79
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,179
screwed because this this is all brand

80
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,800
new and they're not going to be right

81
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,260
all the time but if you don't use them

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,879
and you go in this alone you will lose a

83
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,199
hundred percent of the time

84
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,818
um I will say some things that may or

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,039
may not offend you most likely depending

86
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,719
especially if you're from Canada

87
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,340
apologies in advance

88
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,500
um but it's just from what we've seen

89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,759
from working for so long so like I said

90
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,699
I've been in the industry for almost 60

91
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,899
18 years I'm originally from Wisconsin

92
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:37,639
small little place

93
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,640
was in the military as foreign

94
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,900
so yeah was it linguist speak a few

95
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:52,739
languages got hurt in the service found

96
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,360
cannabis in 2006 in Colorado

97
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,739
so you know Colorado is kind of

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,140
important because we were the first

99
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,840
state to ever legalize medical for

100
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,179
commercial uses not like non-profits in

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,799
California in 1996.

102
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,480
and we're also the first state that

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,819
legalized adult use or recreational

104
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,619
cannabis in 2012.

105
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,719
so kind of a big deal that started in

106
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,599
2014 so I've seen this evolve from

107
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,959
Colorado to multiple States to Canada in

108
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:21,180
2014 Germany to now over 40 countries

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,459
that we've worked in so this just got

110
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,879
started right when I got into this based

111
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:29,219
on really needing cannabis as medicine

112
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,319
is this worth getting into this industry

113
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,940
be it hemp be it medical cannabis adult

114
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,918
use cannabis

115
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,240
having seen thousands of companies and

116
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,219
what they're doing what's working what's

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,100
not like I said largest emerging

118
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,500
industry in the history of the world

119
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,300
because it it was all illegal for so

120
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,439
long but it's just a plan when you think

121
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,120
about What's the total addressable

122
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,100
Market size when you think long term

123
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,500
this is just on adult use and medical

124
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,259
cannabis this isn't including all the

125
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,660
awesome parts of hemp like paper

126
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,879
textiles protein sources

127
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,620
Plastics all of those really sexy things

128
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,740
that we love him for that no one cares

129
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,959
about mostly they care about CBD Delta a

130
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,400
thc0 all these other random things they

131
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,500
can do with how quickly to make money

132
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,120
instead of the long-term sustainable

133
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,939
uses of hemp which will be

134
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,918
incredible once we are able to overtake

135
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,478
cotton and paper and all those things

136
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:22,019
but remember if that's a total

137
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,599
addressable Market of 150 billion

138
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,459
look at those other commodities

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,020
in the United States alone they say that

140
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,739
the illicit Market the illegal market

141
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,240
for cannabis is 150 billion already

142
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,280
and in the United States it's almost

143
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,160
half a trillion

144
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:42,478
500 billion dollars a year in alcohol

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,680
this last year almost tobacco almost 300

146
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,800
billion

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,418
so cannabis you know it's starting but

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,000
it's barely begun even though we've seen

149
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:53,038
it for so long I also used to be a river

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,240
guide in the Grand Canyon I just got off

151
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,759
the river so you're gonna see lots of

152
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,500
pretty pictures from the Grand Canyon

153
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,939
when we look at what's happening though

154
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,459
all around the world just remember in

155
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,918
the United States our country totally

156
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:08,659
illegal like it's the same as

157
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:11,639
heroin marijuana cannabis heroin same

158
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,680
but States unlike countries in Europe

159
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,720
can do what they want states have rights

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,060
and they've legalized medical and adult

161
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,860
use so just don't be confused when you

162
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,899
look at the United States map it's not

163
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,240
legal there as a country but in the

164
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,579
states it is which we'll get to

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,100
but this this has been going on for a

166
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,019
long time and some of us especially here

167
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,180
in Europe you think this is happening so

168
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,799
slowly because you look at what's

169
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,500
happening in America there's social use

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,240
consumption lounges in Las Vegas adults

171
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,699
21 years old they can go into a store

172
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,019
and buy cannabis edibles

173
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,340
anything

174
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,680
and then other states there's people

175
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,000
rotting in jail so the industry's really

176
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,740
been evolving from an adult use

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,680
standpoint with Canada taking the lead

178
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,840
with Uruguay Germany hopefully trying to

179
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,860
do something which we'll get into and

180
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,719
remember there's a big difference

181
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,819
between legalization and

182
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,340
decriminalization legalization allows

183
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,740
the commercialization like actually able

184
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,719
to make revenue from this and like use

185
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,879
Banks and taxes

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,039
the International Medical Market is what

187
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,839
we love it's so incredible let's get

188
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,000
patients medicine we're using

189
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,138
Compassionate Care laws and going

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,120
through those from like the United

191
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,800
Nations drug treaties to actually

192
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,240
legalize but International medical

193
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,759
cannabis the thing you must remember

194
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,098
that's a doctors writing a prescription

195
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,379
for something and that's an API like

196
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:30,300
active pharmaceutical ingredient in the

197
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,180
United States doctors make

198
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,160
recommendations not a prescription not

199
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,680
covered by insurance

200
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,180
recommendations everyone allowed the

201
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
industry to proliferate so everything

202
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,538
you hear about medical cannabis in the

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,879
United States is very very different

204
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,318
than International Medical and how many

205
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,779
doctors are willing to actually write a

206
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,900
prescription for something not that many

207
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,758
because remember the last like what 70

208
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,038
80 years doctors were just told that

209
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,960
like marijuana is the devil it's

210
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,120
horrible it's a narcotic it has no

211
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,180
medical value

212
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,639
we all know that's not true so that that

213
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,019
Paradigm is definitely changing

214
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,139
when you think about the United States

215
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:12,299
though you know far away not legal at

216
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,560
all like I said but this is where all of

217
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,840
the revenue all of the product

218
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,759
development is pretty much happening you

219
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,918
compare the whole world and everything

220
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,120
that happened this last year the United

221
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,978
States about 34 almost 35 billion in

222
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,139
revenue of medical and adult use

223
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:31,978
combined that's not the illicit Market

224
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,538
that's the state legal Markets Canada a

225
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,759
little over 3 billion

226
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:39,778
International Medical less than a

227
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:43,559
billion so almost 40 billion total and

228
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,879
37 of it almost or 30 35 of it almost in

229
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,819
the United States

230
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,320
and that's not even legal as a country

231
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,660
for the states that have done this sorry

232
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,519
Texas also as a medical program I had to

233
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,860
put the little green arrow but

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,600
you know California started this in 1996

235
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,039
with medical but when you look at the

236
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,560
adult use States now and what's

237
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,059
happening and almost half of the America

238
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,259
lives in a state where you can buy

239
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,899
cannabis

240
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,980
but it's not even legal in the country

241
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:11,039
like this is the market where you're

242
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,839
going to see what works what doesn't and

243
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,879
yes taste profiles are different every

244
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,740
country is completely different but the

245
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,659
opportunities and what we can do in in

246
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,759
the United States we're following

247
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,219
regulations of each state and states

248
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,080
have no idea how to do whatever

249
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,580
they're doing they each come up with

250
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,560
their own rules their own license

251
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,560
applications their own product

252
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,958
development standards for testing it's

253
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,059
not like the the FDA like the Food and

254
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,619
Drug Administration is actually telling

255
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,018
States what to do and what they can't do

256
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,879
because it's federally illegal which is

257
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,799
kind of crazy similar to also what's

258
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,419
happening in the European Union but it's

259
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,159
happening and it's happening faster than

260
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,719
you could think but many of these

261
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,879
markets just because they have a program

262
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,220
doesn't mean it's a good program some

263
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,379
it's like a one percent THC Market or

264
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,019
like low THC markets where you can't

265
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,000
even have flowers smokables edibles but

266
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,459
as soon as the program starts it always

267
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,899
evolves and it always gets better it's

268
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,699
just a matter of how long it's going to

269
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,320
take to get better how long it's going

270
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,759
to suck along the way

271
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,140
but eventually it's all going to get

272
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,899
better

273
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,980
so we started off 2023 we're out looking

274
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,899
for gold it's going to be a great

275
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,759
year right well when you look at

276
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,440
what's actually happening

277
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,059
I'm always talking about Portugal being

278
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,880
amazing which it is an international

279
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:26,039
medical cannabis long term will be so so

280
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,740
good but when you think about all these

281
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,079
public companies cutting staff cutting

282
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,580
companies reducing assets

283
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,139
they all ran over and thought they're

284
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,060
going to take over the world but then

285
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,919
sadly it didn't happen to legalize as

286
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,479
quickly as people thought and they're

287
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,458
holding all these toxic assets well

288
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,080
meanwhile small private companies are

289
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,719
like we want to be a public company like

290
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,820
them but they're the bed at the

291
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,500
same time so do you want to actually be

292
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,339
somebody who looks big and all fancy

293
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,240
that actually is billions of dollars in

294
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,579
debt

295
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,680
and asking for more money like was that

296
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:00,120
four billion dollars that can it be got

297
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,759
was that not enough you got to

298
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,320
do a 95 million

299
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,958
convertible note you just need more and

300
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
more you're like given like it's If

301
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,899
You Give a Mouse a Cookie

302
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,699
it's gonna ask for a glass of milk and

303
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,500
that's what that is

304
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,000
um I make fun of Canada a lot These are

305
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,399
times just looking at like the five-year

306
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,019
Public Market but Canada was the first

307
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,000
country to legalize adult use like

308
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,740
federally other than Uruguay but Uruguay

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,740
is not like a love Uruguay

310
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:31,620
so they started this since it wasn't

311
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,140
federally illegal they could have public

312
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,820
companies cool so then they started

313
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,980
raising all this Capital but then like

314
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,200
it's Canada you got less than 40

315
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,300
million people and they almost all live

316
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,040
90 live within 10 miles of the U.S

317
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,259
border

318
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,360
is it going to be that big is it is that

319
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,039
a great country to like grow bananas or

320
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,480
pineapples and Export them to the whole

321
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,919
world no

322
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,420
but they were first and they thought

323
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,719
that was going to be the case now

324
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,519
they've sadly mistaken you then look a

325
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,600
little bit later you're like okay Peaks

326
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,220
and valleys it's going to get better

327
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,379
eventually legalization is going to

328
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,160
happen all over the world and it'll be

329
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,320
great

330
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,000
and then here's today this is the entire

331
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,800
history of public companies in Canada

332
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,259
that have Assets in the United States

333
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,019
all over the world

334
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,120
if you look at that line not super fancy

335
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,740
there sad face

336
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,320
so where's this going the bottom is

337
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,700
cannabis just suck no

338
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,100
we just thought it was going to legalize

339
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,740
a lot faster we thought doctors would

340
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,060
get educated people would get on board

341
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,459
apparently giant commodity change

342
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,719
doesn't happen as fast as we'd like we

343
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:37,439
think about alcohol that's been around

344
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,019
for what 10 20 30 100 000 a long

345
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,820
time tobacco they were looking for gold

346
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,078
they found tobacco over there about 500

347
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,860
years ago they're like let's bring that

348
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,500
back

349
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,879
hmm huge commodity if only weed was

350
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,679
addictive how this would have been

351
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,299
legal already fill up British America

352
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,919
like they all would have like it would

353
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,319
have been good

354
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,659
but it's not so this doesn't mean that

355
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,220
everything sucks it just means how they

356
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,039
were guessing legalization and capital

357
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,839
raises it wasn't correct and a lot of

358
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,578
money has disappeared because of that

359
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,019
so when we think about Canada I had to

360
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,759
bring up I haven't seen this movie yet

361
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,078
but last week there was an announcement

362
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,600
from one of these companies that's

363
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,458
actually like from the 1980s like a

364
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,339
pharmaceutical company there was this

365
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,259
news like hey they got approved to have

366
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,420
cocaine it was like this much cocaine

367
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,600
for clinical trials and research and to

368
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:27,120
import leaves to do like not legalized

369
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,120
cocaine but everyone's like hey

370
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,399
weed first now this their stock just

371
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,240
skyrocketed they've been around for like

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,278
40 45 years they make like three million

373
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,778
in Revenue so nothing company they made

374
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,240
more on that one day in stock than

375
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,799
almost anyone in this room's whole

376
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,139
family would make in three generations

377
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,519
but it all disappeared because these

378
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,919
Bubbles and these news and people

379
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,839
jumping on like little things

380
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,639
it doesn't happen so it's like a

381
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,200
bear on cocaine just destroying crazy

382
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,720
it's not going to work out well for

383
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,759
anybody not even the bear

384
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,320
so just as you're navigating this world

385
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,240
especially here in Europe think about

386
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,860
like Don't Be Like Cocaine bear don't

387
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,120
hear like oh safe banking is going to

388
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,399
pass or like this is going to happen

389
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,620
Germany's gonna legalize like let's buy

390
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,360
millions of dollars of real estate it'll

391
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,820
be like just like Canada or California

392
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,700
or Colorado or New York or New Jersey

393
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,680
no this is Europe

394
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,060
you're it's going to be different and

395
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,379
don't just jump on some of these news

396
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,719
items

397
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,578
yeah again Canada

398
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,560
I had to say though that's it you know

399
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:30,778
that's a tundra Swan so I had to put up

400
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,819
the Canadian goose I used that years ago

401
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:34,919
I just love that so just don't

402
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,420
do what Canada did no offense Canada but

403
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,819
like there's a different way you can do

404
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,860
this in Europe so hey Europe new

405
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,120
opportunity it's like we discovered a

406
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,860
whole new continent except for in

407
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,500
Reverse right all the stuff we've been

408
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,000
doing over there but granted the

409
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,740
Netherlands and the coffee houses and

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,679
the genetics like the history of this

411
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,120
Market in Europe blessings y'all have

412
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,739
been dealing with the same things that

413
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,360
we have but just you haven't had the

414
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,919
same opportunities you got the

415
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,839
Netherlands weed experiment these Social

416
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,939
Clubs in Spain

417
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,860
Germany's new program

418
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,779
but when you think about

419
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,120
like Big Brother and big sister I like

420
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,740
to call these two like this is not like

421
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,778
States

422
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,698
you know countries but your members is

423
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,720
something that's kind of significant and

424
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:17,639
not just going to let you do whatever

425
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,959
the hell you want to do so when you

426
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,339
think about like the population the

427
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,799
medical Market what's happening like

428
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,779
German import side like amazing that the

429
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,879
bee farm started that the Netherlands

430
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,939
allowing bedrich hand back 2005 like

431
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,980
medical cannabis is evolving in Europe

432
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,300
amazingly but not fast enough and at

433
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,180
higher standards than anything in

434
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:39,179
America problems though

435
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:41,219
same different day these are all

436
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,359
the public companies here in Europe that

437
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,740
are like Hey we're gonna take

438
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,539
over the world where European public

439
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,360
companies they're coming to the show

440
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:50,338
about eight years after Canada

441
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,600
nobody's looking that great and the ones

442
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,579
that are actually bona fide are doing

443
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,500
other things not just weed

444
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,698
sorry it's like that's a nice picture of

445
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,799
to Pete's Canyon there in the Grand

446
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:00,899
Canyon like a lot so like don't fall off

447
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,278
the cliff don't do the same same

448
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,078
things are happening over here that were

449
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,759
happening in Canada

450
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,379
this is kind of a big deal I talk about

451
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,019
this all the time but remember December

452
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:13,019
2nd 2020

453
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,539
we rescheduled cannabis internationally

454
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,159
at the commission for narcotic drugs

455
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:19,740
pretty awesome during coronavirus

456
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,240
Ukraine voted for it down at the bottom

457
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,579
big deal

458
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,159
this is not even three weeks ago

459
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:28,559
the European commission literally is

460
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,078
suing Hungary in international court for

461
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,578
not voting with them

462
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,379
for the scheduling hungry's like oh

463
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:36,000
we're not ready for that but they all

464
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,679
said as part of this European commission

465
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
European Union like we're gonna do

466
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,120
together we're all homies they just

467
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,699
didn't vote to like reschedule cannabis

468
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,899
and they're taking them to court

469
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:47,219
what the do you think that the

470
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,600
European Union and the European

471
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,060
commission are going to do when it comes

472
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,399
to Germany

473
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:55,319
legalizing adult use awesome which I'm

474
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,240
all for it's just remember they said

475
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,620
like they will legalize it and draft all

476
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,899
their laws and I know we've talked a lot

477
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,278
about Germany today before me but I'm

478
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,078
also a realist it's not going to happen

479
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,880
as fast as you think it's not going to

480
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,279
be how most people think and Big Brother

481
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,260
Big Sister also dealing with a

482
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,338
war in Ukraine right now on your border

483
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:12,720
like

484
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,980
there's other things that are a little

485
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,600
bit more important than like how

486
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,759
Germany's going to legalize weed but if

487
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,798
they just do it for adult use it won't

488
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,179
be like how we do it in America and it

489
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,539
won't be like it's been done anywhere

490
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:27,780
else and Germany you are up they are big

491
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,918
huge GDP 90 million people but it won't

492
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,599
be the same

493
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,100
so when we're thinking about like look

494
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,019
at all the Canadian companies that came

495
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:37,379
and tried to take over Europe a whole

496
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,480
bunch of again

497
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,620
hmm like they just like put up their

498
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,700
feet like they're at nank we've been

499
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:43,439
thinking the world's just going to be

500
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,940
great we're taking over the world not

501
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,980
looking that great

502
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,660
selling those assets

503
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,058
switching over to Spain we're here

504
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,558
social use kind of consumption lounges

505
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:54,119
but not really you know we're all

506
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,639
medical patients with our little farms

507
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,678
and so forth but tolerated programs are

508
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,000
different than legalized programs and

509
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,200
what happened this last week with the

510
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,880
Spanish Parliament which you guys all

511
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,038
heard about earlier today

512
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
very much indicative of what's going to

513
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,519
happen other countries are going to keep

514
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,740
pushing bills forward just like in

515
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,619
America and they're going to hit a lot

516
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,240
of roadblocks or those Steamrollers but

517
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:16,678
at least remember like this is a

518
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,419
medicinal plan

519
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,280
we're all related

520
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,360
patients need safe access to Medicine

521
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,759
first

522
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,859
but medicine is really hard to like

523
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,140
educate doctors about and everyone's

524
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,879
already using this plan product so like

525
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,900
what modalities are going to work here

526
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,640
in Europe and how are you going to

527
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,320
capitalize and grab those opportunities

528
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,460
that's really what I like to help

529
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,379
navigate

530
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,298
switch into the world here Latin America

531
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,440
is one of my favorites I mean you look

532
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:41,759
at some of the Farms that we've helped

533
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,740
to develop and the things happening in

534
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,319
like Columbia or could be happening in

535
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,000
Peru with Uruguay with their adult use

536
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,859
side and their medical side with like

537
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,380
free trade zones and large cultivation

538
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:54,359
and imports it well mostly exports not

539
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,080
much is being imported unless it's just

540
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,599
for

541
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,519
fake news so that they can have higher

542
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,659
priced stocks but like massive

543
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,359
production going to be happening here

544
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,160
long term for medical and adult use

545
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,899
it's just where the sun grows it's the

546
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,759
same with like Thailand or anyone near

547
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,320
the equator but like major things

548
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,720
happening here but it's just going to

549
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,879
sit hold do the right thing not make a

550
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,500
ton of money but long term like where

551
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,720
does coffee come from

552
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,759
where do bananas come from it's not

553
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,220
warehouses in Canada it's not

554
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,259
greenhouses in Denmark it's not even

555
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,000
warehouses in Germany

556
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,400
maybe in the beginning

557
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,839
but it's it's all changing you think

558
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,519
about Africa Africa has been a little

559
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,980
slow South Africa was really the first

560
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,019
big mover and then like lesotho's

561
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,298
Zimbabwe and then you had like Swaziland

562
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,639
doing things but Africa has been a lot

563
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:43,740
more complicated than most people

564
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,660
thought but also like with South Africa

565
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,980
with sap run some of their changes like

566
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,980
pushing towards adult use or

567
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,599
decriminalization a lot of developments

568
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,940
have happened there but not tons of

569
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,219
exports yet but it's definitely one of

570
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,000
those markets that like long-term you

571
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,740
know when you're thinking about like

572
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Malawi legalizing medical and some of

573
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,220
these other countries the opportunities

574
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,558
could be vast coming from Africa

575
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,900
Asia have been slow as hell Thailand was

576
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,240
kind of an accident where it's like they

577
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,820
really confused decriminalization with

578
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,140
legalization they did Medical in the

579
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,700
beginning with the university and it was

580
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,440
like this is awesome wow they used to

581
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,480
put you in jail and kill you now medical

582
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,798
research with the college cool and then

583
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,240
they're like hey decrim everyone's like

584
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,918
that's legalized

585
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,359
and then it kind of like the cat's out

586
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,280
of the bag right now and no one really

587
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,479
knows what to do including the Thai

588
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,940
government

589
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,279
but then it's one of the only countries

590
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,419
it's a pig's country one of those pic-s

591
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,279
countries where it's the same

592
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,679
pharmaceutical development standards as

593
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,579
the European Union and the FDA in

594
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,160
America

595
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:44,699
that's why like Thailand is like

596
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,279
potentially Beyond incredible long term

597
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,779
Oceana kind of been shitty gonna be

598
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,639
shitty for a while good good for the

599
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,200
patients anyone who thinks they're going

600
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,059
to take over the world from Australia

601
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,679
probably not the case remember in that

602
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:57,298
game of Risk it's only two troop

603
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,038
reinforcements every time it's not that

604
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,558
big it's way down there you got some

605
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,140
weird taxes New Zealand though like they

606
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,000
will pass adult use this next time

607
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,520
remember that last time it was shy by

608
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,900
like 4 000 votes like that's gangster

609
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,099
they can do that because they're not

610
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,200
part of the European commission or

611
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:15,178
European Union they're their own kind of

612
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,860
little thing

613
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,019
those are the countries like Canada that

614
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,839
can do some massive things so

615
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,400
all of this takes money we all are just

616
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,319
who we are but like one of the biggest

617
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,960
problems raising Capital right now in

618
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,460
this space well one we're pretty much

619
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,380
illegal

620
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,360
like we've been considered a narcotic

621
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,520
forever

622
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,918
it's an amazing plant that all of our

623
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,538
ancestors have used for tens of

624
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,940
thousands hundreds of thousands and

625
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:43,558
millions of years and like co-evolved

626
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,380
with it like we made our houses from it

627
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:49,079
we sail across the seas with this plant

628
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,940
we write our constitutions on it

629
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,259
and then we also like ruined a lot of

630
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,840
people's lives and put them in prison

631
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,599
for growing a plant selling a plant

632
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,418
I mean alcohol is legal tobacco is legal

633
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:03,418
those are great for society right only

634
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:05,100
positive things happen from those

635
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,140
I mean it's fun sometimes but like

636
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:10,319
swedes so like how do we raise Capital

637
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,179
now Family offices private institutions

638
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,819
it's not just saying you're going to be

639
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,320
some gangster internationally making a

640
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:18,298
public company and then not delivering

641
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,399
on those expectations once you go public

642
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:22,440
and you have shareholder value coming

643
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,480
down and staring down your face

644
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,100
you got to be ready for that scrutiny

645
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,919
that's why private companies I've said

646
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:31,139
this for the last decade the private

647
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,880
companies that can get in hold positions

648
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,919
scale and raise that private Capital

649
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,539
with the right debt loads

650
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,640
they're going to take over those are

651
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,079
going to be like the cargills those are

652
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,460
going to be like the Nestle's but like

653
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,899
not evil or you know not like not evil

654
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,819
but like in a good way like a good

655
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,559
Nestle imagine that

656
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:50,939
like that's what private companies in

657
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,519
cannabis could be

658
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,860
but so many startups remember we're a

659
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,538
startup industry it's brand new full of

660
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,418
startup companies

661
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:02,579
and 99 of those companies fail

662
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,038
because business is hard you got people

663
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:07,519
doing things changing regulations people

664
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,779
die there's Wars resource stuff

665
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,179
pandemics like it's hard to run

666
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,940
businesses if any of you do I work with

667
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,440
them every day internal and external so

668
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,840
if you're a startup in the startup

669
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,640
industry how can you be a good startup

670
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,379
even if you're around for five years ten

671
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,820
years you're still a startup

672
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,080
you're not like something that's been

673
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,000
around like Deloitte or something

674
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,399
long-term or like

675
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,619
Mercantile marine or like 500 year old

676
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,380
companies Dutch you know

677
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:36,178
so if you need Capital raising start now

678
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,559
plan out your business remember just

679
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,360
because this is cannabis industry

680
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:40,500
doesn't mean you can just everyone

681
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,658
thinks we're going to make all this

682
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,819
money this is not 10 years ago this is

683
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,659
not five years ago and this is not last

684
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:47,639
year

685
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,980
but like the capital that you need if

686
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,380
you need that in your business start

687
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,480
planning that make your models start

688
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,520
actually thinking is your business plan

689
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,860
viable can you actually do what you want

690
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,599
to do do the laws allow it just because

691
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:02,099
Germany might legalize in how they're

692
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,839
going to and you're going to do all of

693
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,480
this like delivery services with an app

694
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,038
or something cool but like

695
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,140
what are the key constraints for that

696
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,779
what are the risks how do you actually

697
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,220
do these businesses and anything that

698
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,279
you think you're going to do in Europe I

699
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:20,220
guarantee you I'll say 90

700
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,319
9 98 of the time we've already

701
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,000
experienced in the United States of

702
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,399
solving that problem of like pre-roll

703
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,740
joint packaging or like app delivery

704
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,200
cash management systems consumer loyalty

705
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,000
programs greenhouses it's not some new

706
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,319
light it's not some new fixture that's

707
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,079
going to like be the Innovative thing

708
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,000
that changes the world your new coconut

709
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,099
core or nutrient or fertilizer is

710
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,740
probably not that great remember this is

711
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:45,480
an agricultural commodity this is a food

712
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,339
manufacturing product or pharmaceutical

713
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,860
product and a retail consumer package

714
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:51,599
good at the end of the day and a

715
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,979
sacred beautiful plant that's like saved

716
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,319
a lot of Our Lives

717
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,880
and we didn't start this movement we're

718
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,619
not going to finish it we're just like

719
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,000
caretaking it for a little while here in

720
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,219
this time so like if you're going to do

721
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,140
this and raise into play Capital you've

722
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,940
got to do it right this is a huge

723
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,259
responsibility for future Generations so

724
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,900
the world's changing and it's

725
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,700
changing fast just like this is called

726
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,919
the Butte fault it's deep in the Grand

727
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,720
Canyon I love this place so trippy but

728
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,520
like everything's changing and evolving

729
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,440
and like there's forces and pressures

730
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,480
and heat but like how do you actually

731
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,640
sustain some of these forces erase

732
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,980
Capital you plan those companies correct

733
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,360
it's beautiful but then you got to be

734
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,519
ready to change and adapt with it

735
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,139
because if you don't you're gonna get

736
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,240
destroyed and be those Boulders at the

737
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,700
bottom and Europe is not going to be

738
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,038
that different than America happened

739
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,900
at least in terms of time but like we're

740
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,400
all people and like I said earlier

741
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,559
there's taste profiles there's different

742
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,240
preferences but this is a plant and at

743
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:47,819
the end of the day growing tons of it

744
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,679
oil extraction from Fields with combines

745
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:52,500
will be very very similar

746
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,480
to like other like corn soy wheat other

747
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,278
sorts of Commodities and the big

748
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,620
are going to take it so we only

749
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,538
have so much time because the big

750
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,639
want it it's too risky for them

751
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:04,619
to take it yet you know yeah

752
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,380
constellation through 4 billion into

753
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,119
canopy you know that happens you know

754
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,419
I don't want to say that four billion

755
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,579
dollars is a drop in the bucket but no

756
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,440
one's in it yet so if you're in this and

757
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:17,939
when those changes happen just like in

758
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,400
America when Federal legalization

759
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,900
happens those companies that have

760
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,100
massive market share and position and

761
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,259
all these different little States

762
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:27,418
because if I grow cannabis in Canon

763
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:29,940
California I can't sell that in a

764
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,500
company in Colorado like what grows in a

765
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,480
state has to be sold in the same state

766
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,400
and consumed in the state can't take it

767
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,240
out of the state for businesses or

768
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,159
people

769
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,140
but that's why like each State's its own

770
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,700
little country right now but then our

771
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,500
European commission or our European

772
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,200
Union aka the federal government America

773
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,659
doesn't can't really do anything like

774
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,720
cats out of the bag here the cat is not

775
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,679
out of the bag you got Netherlands

776
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,740
Amsterdam about to maybe take away

777
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:58,140
coffee houses and oh damn here they

778
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,058
just approved four more times yes

779
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,380
this is a great song saying like hey you

780
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,379
got five minutes you better be ready

781
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,500
yes we like that

782
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:10,319
so

783
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,058
you only got so much time same panda

784
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,538
that pan has been down the river like 14

785
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:17,819
times so uh you gotta start going faster

786
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,859
you got to start collaborating the

787
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,019
people that are with you here the things

788
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:23,939
you can learn from other lessons

789
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:26,819
that's how we grow as a species and like

790
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,038
I said this plant we didn't invent it it

791
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,139
was given to us we're at a very unique

792
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,000
moment in time that future Generations

793
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,100
will look back at and they will

794
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,720
judge us if we did this wrong like this

795
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:39,240
does not need to be like other things

796
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,579
but it is like other things so take from

797
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,659
those sorts of lessons and just know if

798
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:45,058
you're going to look forward into this

799
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,400
in the future like it just got started

800
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:49,019
you're not late to the party we just

801
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,600
started the dance it seems like it's

802
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:55,200
been going for what Colorado almost 10

803
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,599
years of recreational adult use cannabis

804
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,880
I mean 1996 like this has been going for

805
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,439
a while but it's just actually really

806
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,059
getting started so

807
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,100
I'm definitely open to some questions if

808
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:06,960

bit and tell you actually what's going

812
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,500
