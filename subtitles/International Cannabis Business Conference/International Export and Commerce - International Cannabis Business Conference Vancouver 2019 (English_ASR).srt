1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:14,550
how's everyone doing that's excellent

2
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:16,919
okay if we could all do that now that's

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,109
a spectacular I'll just wait for the

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,060
room to a couple more minutes seconds

5
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,278
here and we'll create a little

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:28,918
environment to talk about international

7
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:31,679
and commerce so you're probably noticing

8
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:36,119
that our panel is a little better than

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:41,030
anticipated with me on my immediate left

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:45,920
is Andrew Muir off and on my right is

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:51,049
Linus Weber and my I'm Robert Lawrie and

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:54,210
well we were missing mr. Tom's uber and

13
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:57,169
who I'm told had some flight

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,878
complications and Clint Young

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,039
unfortunately as really under the

16
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,109
weather so what we thought we would do

17
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,750
given that there's just three of us our

18
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:10,019
panel discussion is really more going to

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,390
be I would call it a fireside chat and

20
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:16,679
we should have enough room for questions

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:23,700
and with that I think we'll kick it off

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:27,060
so Canada as we all know has been in the

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,060
world leader in international cannabis

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,859
market being that it's the first g7

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,560
country to federally create a regime

26
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:40,438
devoted to legalization but competition

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,219
is certainly ramping up as other

28
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:48,438
countries legalized and we're seeing a

29
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:53,449
whole bunch of different models from

30
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:57,478
Uruguay Israel the Netherlands Germany

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,490
Australia I could go on Thailand

32
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,069
every day there seems to be another

33
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,858
country either decriminalizing

34
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:11,310
legalizing or introducing some form of

35
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:13,439
regulation and with that being said why

36
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,610
don't we just take a moment YouTube well

37
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,069
we'll start with mr. you

38
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,040
introduce yourself and just take us

39
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,989
through you know the your involvement

40
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,739
with international cannabis and then

41
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,360
we'll hear from Linus alright thanks for

42
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,370
having me glad to be on the stage with

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,430
both of you and the other guys missed

44
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,580
out so their loss my name is Andrew and

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm the CEO strain print technologies we

46
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,890
capture patient reported outcomes from

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,370
medical cannabis patients who are

48
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:47,199
treating with legal product mainly and

49
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,150
we deliver that anonymous data back to

50
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,669
the industry we have the largest data

51
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,830
set of its kind in the world today over

52
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,780
1.4 million patient reported outcomes

53
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,860
were Toronto based where Canadian

54
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:04,120
company and we service today

55
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:08,230
Canada the us-israel and hopefully soon

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,599
in the European Union right on Linus

57
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:14,649
thank you for having me my name is Linus

58
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,569
I'm from Germany founder and CEO of

59
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,330
nimbus health fully licensed

60
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:21,909
pharmaceutical wholesaler we've been in

61
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,340
the business since July only started two

62
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:29,439
years ago sort of starting building up

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:32,140
the yeah connections to producers

64
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,300
outside the European Union now also

65
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,488
inside European a very keen to see how

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,070
the market especially in the European

67
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,550
Union now as more and more producers

68
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,629
coming in but of course challenging

69
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,750
challenges are rising also on the

70
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:50,530
Canadian side let's see how the US are

71
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,870
moving as far as I can tell the domestic

72
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,729
supply in Germany is not enough at least

73
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,080
for the next four years so we are

74
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:01,179
heavily reliant on you producing and

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,030
importing together with us hopefully

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,040
thank you thank you

77
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,300
those are both great answers and

78
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,489
certainly give us a platform to build on

79
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,459
as I indicated earlier my name is Robert

80
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,470
Laurie and well I by trade I'm an

81
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,530
international lawyer I'm licensed in

82
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,890
England and Wales and here in British

83
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:26,439
Columbia and I studied law at Oxford and

84
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,039
with my previous life I was a securities

85
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,550
fraud lawyer

86
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,230
a hedge fund formation lawyer which

87
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,520
developed a great understanding of

88
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,140
onshore offshore tax arbitrage and

89
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,750
that's effectively what we're starting

90
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,689
to see more and more are companies that

91
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,259
are structuring their operations in

92
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:49,969
manners which are tax efficient and I

93
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:54,139
would like to I guess put out to both of

94
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:57,340
you the question as what is driving your

95
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:00,649
your respective businesses is it

96
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:02,449
following Canada as an example or is it

97
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,519
other considerations such as tax

98
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,079
efficiencies wondering if you might be

99
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,930
able to comment let's start with lioness

100
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,300
this time well basically if you look at

101
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,490
the history for Germany in 1998 we have

102
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,170
dronabinol which is a purely THC

103
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,720
compound which was sort of given to

104
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,780
patients since 2003 we have flowers

105
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,690
already from from the Netherlands so

106
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:26,750
there has been already a market for it

107
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:29,750
however in 2007 t it became possible to

108
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,699
reimburse medicinal cannabis by the

109
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,379
health insurance of the people in

110
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,110
germany and this was sort of the game

111
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:38,480
changer we're now ramping up in the last

112
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,699
two and a half years it's only 70,000

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,700
patients but this is due to the fact

114
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:47,029
that we don't have the education of the

115
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:51,139
doctors so sort of copying on the one

116
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:53,359
side from the medicinal space we are

117
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,339
basically as an experiment in Europe

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,560
from everyone so a little bit from

119
00:05:55,339 --> 00:06:00,409
Canada in the United States and so on

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,569
and so forth but in the end we need more

121
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,770
doctors education and this is something

122
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:09,680
we should start copying more efficiently

123
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:12,139
sort of opening up the world of the yeah

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,209
of cannabis to our doctors in Germany to

125
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,149
be able to sort of bring more patients

126
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:19,939
in because we have 70,000 patients and I

127
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:23,569
think the potential is between 800,000

128
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:24,980
and 1.6 million because it's roughly one

129
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:31,389
to two percent of the population of

130
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:34,280
Germany interesting Andrew we track

131
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,039
patient performance against lab verify

132
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,079
product and in most jurisdictions you

133
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,490
don't have even a testing requirement

134
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:44,539
today so the key to us understanding the

135
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,129
science behind what works and what

136
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,890
doesn't is to be able to identify which

137
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:50,629
chemical constituents are are Co related

138
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,120
to what's symptomatic improvement and

139
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,149
drilling down by cohort by age by gender

140
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,370
and being able to see that 35 year old

141
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,019
women react to certain chemical profiles

142
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,750
different than 50 year old men for

143
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:06,019
example so if we think about other

144
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,720
jurisdictions where the u.s. is a good

145
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:10,819
example every state is an island every

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,670
state has its own regulatory regime for

147
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:15,980
how they both how they grow as well as

148
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:19,490
how they test so for me it's about

149
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:23,300
taking the experiences from Canada with

150
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,620
lab verified products and the those the

151
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,780
data that's related to those lab

152
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,079
verified products and translating that

153
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,969
into foreign markets where we haven't

154
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,719
actually tested local product there but

155
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:39,020
we know that chemical profile aligns to

156
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,630
two personality so even in Europe today

157
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,099
there's as we know there's very little

158
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,680
product there so we have an opportunity

159
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,000
right now to take what we know and we've

160
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,769
had the fortune to do that here in

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,329
Canada only because the regulations are

162
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:52,069
the way they are so I think we actually

163
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:53,870
from my perspective we had a great

164
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:58,550
advantage here that the regs were so

165
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:02,540
tight interesting well an avenue that

166
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,710
you may not think about that certainly

167
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,660
should come to mind in the discussion of

168
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:13,099
international it was with certainly

169
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,740
First Nations now at the moment as c-45

170
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:20,150
the cannabis act stands there is no

171
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:23,240
information or guidance as to how First

172
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:26,029
Nations should be setting up legal

173
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,819
cannabis operations we have to remember

174
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:31,089
that First Nations are also technically

175
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,830
a fourth level of government and

176
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:36,829
recently I was made a board member on

177
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:40,430
the Zagg emmaus inna Beck First Nations

178
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,920
cannabis board which you starting to see

179
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,519
First Nations understanding that through

180
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,019
their own process of self-determination

181
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,500
provided they are then

182
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:53,449
endorsed by banned and ban council they

183
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,909
then are able to create infrastructure

184
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:00,470
such as a cannabis board on their land

185
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:02,600
and begin to engage in this process but

186
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,970
I have always thought that that could go

187
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,209
a step further depending on the band

188
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,519
again depending on the nation if it's a

189
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:14,569
Jay treaty band and again that goes back

190
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:17,539
to the late 1850s or so which was a

191
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,670
recognition of by the US Canadian and

192
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:22,039
British governments of the First Nations

193
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:25,009
that were in existence at that time and

194
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:28,549
the stipulation was to recognise the

195
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:31,458
free movement of people in goods and I

196
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:33,500
think well what I know is coming is that

197
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:35,149
you're going to see a lot more First

198
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,370
Nations exercising their

199
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,610
self-determination in some form or

200
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:43,940
another to realize a tax efficiency and

201
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,310
I started looking at this like 6 7 years

202
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,890
ago and my first legal aid case in Haida

203
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:51,019
Gwaii I was up there and they're talking

204
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,699
about you know getting into the wine

205
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,069
trade and I was like have you seen the

206
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,690
wind that's 180 like miles an hour

207
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,490
you're gonna be harvesting grapes and

208
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,800
Prince Rupert what about cannabis

209
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,570
because ultimately I looked at it as

210
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,419
Haida Gwaii could very much be the

211
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,520
bermuda or the bahamas of british

212
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:11,120
columbia with respect to an onshore

213
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,189
offshore arbitrage so that i think we're

214
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,549
going to see across the United States

215
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,779
First Nations engaging in

216
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:20,569
self-determination which could lead to

217
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:22,879
international deals with the European

218
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,190
market and with certainly cross-border

219
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,990
what are your thoughts on that I think

220
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,610
it's couldn't happen soon enough I mean

221
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,039
we there's there's a massive opportunity

222
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:36,680
in production and a massive opportunity

223
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:38,088
in export once a level of compliance is

224
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:42,109
reached I think that's the big king

225
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:44,480
right now is is bringing production

226
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,940
facilities on those lands up to the same

227
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,990
level that are in and that's not to say

228
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,029
it can't be done of course it can be

229
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,200
done it's just it does is it a priority

230
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:54,259
right now and it hasn't been

231
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,200
until now but but it will be and and

232
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:59,419
there is a lot of opportunity for

233
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,759
product to cross borders that don't have

234
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:04,639
the same level of export regulation that

235
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,879
say any of any of the big producers here

236
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,429
today have right on any thoughts yeah

237
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:13,039
it's it's a weird perspective on First

238
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:15,559
Nations exactly I mean we have from a

239
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,259
from a European standpoint and that's

240
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:21,649
basically the word everybody heard of is

241
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:26,000
the u GMP certification process and Nick

242
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:28,970
did it in his in his speech that there's

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,850
like a huge effort to really reach that

244
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,560
kind of certification we're engaging in

245
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,899
that and I think there need to be clear

246
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,759
standard ways of how to produce

247
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:39,110
medicinal cannabis throughout the world

248
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,110
and this can only be done through

249
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,800
collaboration and I see that this really

250
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,810
urge for collaboration in cannabis is

251
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,370
there I mean my background is Pharma

252
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:51,829
there wasn't like everybody was working

253
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,450
in their little offices and now with

254
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,450
Canada we have the possibility to really

255
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,540
do that collaborative work in order to

256
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:03,530
find really standards that would ease

257
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:05,959
the export and ease also any processes

258
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:08,689
in a sort of bringing products either

259
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,660
from Canada to other you restrictions or

260
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,550
also into Canada I would say I mean

261
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:16,250
domestic supply in Germany is not enough

262
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:18,469
but others will be ramping up so there

263
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,169
must be some kind of standardization in

264
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,129
the process yeah and that's what I think

265
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:27,549
is the big challenge in the near future

266
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:31,519
well given there's a lot of products

267
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:34,429
going from A to B and C and D and back

268
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,169
to a probably how are the products

269
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:39,259
getting to their destinations

270
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:43,849
I'll just have now given an anecdote I

271
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:45,799
mean I I have BC product that I bought

272
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,340
that got delivered to me in Ontario and

273
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,259
I brought it back to BC you know

274
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,360
products are getting transported in a

275
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:58,009
lot of different ways and I think

276
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,539
there's there are both logistical issues

277
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:01,490
but there are regulatory issues I don't

278
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,110
I don't even know

279
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,500
how we're ever going to get into the US

280
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:11,060
and then in the near future because it's

281
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,139
it's very exclusionary for lack of a

282
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,849
better word I think it's a short-term

283
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,500
problem but it is what it is right now

284
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,240
so I don't think the US market is gonna

285
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,889
be but how do we get products into the

286
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,830
UK we're just talking about this earlier

287
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,840
or into the EU if you can get into the

288
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,639
market is it transported by air is a

289
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,870
transported by ship is it transported by

290
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,009
rail and we know that they have a

291
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:32,149
prevalence for for rail so I'm just a

292
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,649
data guy but I'm just speaking

293
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:37,730
observationally on what I see

294
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:40,370
so Linus you've get somehow this product

295
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,870
comes from the Netherlands makes its way

296
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,820
to Germany do you want to take us

297
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,060
through that exactly and we actually are

298
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:49,250
using a normal transporter springing in

299
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,869
from from from bedrock and basically

300
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,700
everybody knows that company doing

301
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,340
standardized medicinal cannabis products

302
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,060
out of the Netherlands that's those are

303
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,160
the ones which we are currently

304
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:00,289
distributing in Germany we are in

305
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,230
discussion with several Canadian

306
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:05,929
companies already but then this Eugene P

307
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,850
certification comes in where it

308
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,000
sometimes gets really difficult but we

309
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,769
now have a GMP professional and our team

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,840
really helps the companies to sort of

311
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,259
ease that process but I must admit of

312
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,259
course it's from coming from Canada it's

313
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,970
always by plane and we had the first

314
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:27,319
plane arriving from tilray

315
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,259
in Germany last week from Portugal

316
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,000
so there are no new countries coming in

317
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,279
where we can build relationship also

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,769
inside European Union which makes which

319
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,600
makes it a little bit easier but I mean

320
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,460
there are products coming in and there

321
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,639
are possibilities and we are more than

322
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,500
happy to help you understand what is

323
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,500
needed to bring products to the German

324
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,450
market / at the European market because

325
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,940
once it's in the European Union its way

326
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,290
easier of course distributing it to

327
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,770
other countries such as for example

328
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:59,659
Spain Italy Portugal also but

329
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,639
particulars now has a huge domestic

330
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:04,009
cross that I don't think there is export

331
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,159
needed to Portugal so can I ask a

332
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,659
question to get it into the EU it's the

333
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,339
same regardless of whether or not it's

334
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,769
the end is going into Germany or going

335
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,250
into Switzerland er yes it's not as easy

336
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,689
as that

337
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,789
so of course it

338
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:20,269
once you're inside European Union it's

339
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:23,539
it is easier to have the export license

340
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:25,909
as a European company to export to a

341
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,719
different jurisdiction within the

342
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:28,730
European Union

343
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,550
that's what's easier because it's

344
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,009
already yeah checked by a qualified

345
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,958
person which is also in our team and

346
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,459
then it's also medical approved in

347
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,799
Germany which makes it easier to

348
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,299
distribute any other the other way

349
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:44,629
around it's a bit more difficult because

350
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,609
the Germans always looking very deeply

351
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,500
into the processes and a check if

352
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,079
everything is alright but the other way

353
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,399
around it's it's more easy so so if

354
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:54,019
you're Canadian you'd look for the

355
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,669
easiest jurisdiction in the EU to get

356
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:59,419
into and then from there you transfer it

357
00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:01,698
into Germany that's its market so I want

358
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:03,259
to engage the audience just indulge me

359
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:06,559
for one second you've been a great

360
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:09,230
audience here with a yay or nay I'd like

361
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:12,768
honest answer we'll see who's louder I

362
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:20,659
guess Canada cannabis regulations are

363
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:22,669
they over regulated nay yay okay good so

364
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:24,318
we can continue because if it went the

365
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:26,629
other way I don't think I could have

366
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:30,169
asked the next question given that

367
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:32,269
Canada had first mover advantage and has

368
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:35,059
created a system that the rest of the

369
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:37,578
world has been watching some have even

370
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:40,008
been adopting and applying but do you

371
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:41,539
feel that the standard in Canada has set

372
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,149
itself too high

373
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:45,919
that'll be very hard for the government

374
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,620
to come down to be competitive so I

375
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,769
guess the question is has Canada in a

376
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,679
way by being so cautious out of the gate

377
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:56,929
has it kneecap itself with respect to be

378
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,258
truly competitive I think it's I think

379
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:01,729
it's actually been a boon for us because

380
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,409
by setting the regulation so high it's

381
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,849
forced us to come to the table with real

382
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:06,918
pharmaceutical type production

383
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:09,109
facilities and really high quality

384
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,319
product that no other jurisdiction would

385
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:14,000
accept if we weren't at that faith so I

386
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,788
kind of look at it the other way if we

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,990
were if we were like the US where the

388
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:19,429
the lens is really about

389
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,558
commercialization and not about public

390
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:23,059
safety I don't think a country like

391
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,639
Germany would even consider bringing it

392
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,889
in with

393
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,939
the type of testing and experience level

394
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,030
that we've had over these and remember

395
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,830
we started out the only reason why we're

396
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:33,839
able to have that jumpstart into the

397
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:35,879
European Union as an example is because

398
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,558
we had a medical program has nothing to

399
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,700
do with a recreational program and the

400
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,079
only reason we're able to go into

401
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,440
foreign markets today is because of the

402
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,869
medical program so I don't think having

403
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,420
a tight regs around the recreational

404
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:50,250
program is is gonna be a limitation and

405
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,320
I also think that it's way easier for

406
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,690
the government in Canada to loosen the

407
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,329
reins than it is for for instance in the

408
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:01,039
US if they can put it back in what's

409
00:17:57,329 --> 00:18:01,039
that that's if they get voted back in

410
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:07,798
yeah I mean from a German perspective I

411
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,130
think there can I can tell if Canada's

412
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:13,379
over-regulated my first time here but

413
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:16,559
basically what we see is a German would

414
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,970
always do something rather not than

415
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,069
doing it wrong

416
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,039
and that's why they're very cautious and

417
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:25,829
careful by sort of importing products

418
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,710
into Germany and nobody knows really how

419
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:31,769
to do it right every local authority

420
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,798
needs to do that import license for the

421
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:37,950
respective producers base of respective

422
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,319
distributors and this is also based on

423
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,850
the place where you're located in

424
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,950
Germany for example I'm from Hesse in

425
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:46,409
Frankfurt and we have three authorities

426
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,179
which are sort of overlooking the whole

427
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,070
process we have a nakaka

428
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,200
in narcotic agency would end in the end

429
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:55,829
decides what is done so we have of

430
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,529
course huge regulations as well but it's

431
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:00,089
sort of the processes are getting easier

432
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:03,690
because they've been done a couple of

433
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:05,668
times now and yeah as I said we are more

434
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,120
than happy to assist I think as Nick

435
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:11,190
said earlier we you should always go

436
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,869
with the with a good GMP consult and in

437
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,419
order to be able to sort of overlook

438
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:17,789
what is needed before you end up having

439
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,250
huge cost and will not be able to bring

440
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,029
products in hey before we go to

441
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,640
questions

442
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:25,859
is there anything in particular that we

443
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,290
haven't covered that either of you'd

444
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:30,209
like to share about the uniqueness of

445
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:33,500
being ahead of the curve if you will

446
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,048
with your business and be happy to learn

447
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,380
about this we were fortunate to be

448
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:42,250
gathering data in 2016 so we had a

449
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,780
pretty big head start and doing it now

450
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,069
we still have to deal with as we go into

451
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:48,918
international markets we still have to

452
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:52,308
deal with jurisdictional transfer of

453
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:55,909
data across borders so going into Europe

454
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:59,168
for example we we have to be GNP GDP are

455
00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:01,909
compliant which is the privacy

456
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:04,640
regulation in in that market and if if

457
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,559
you will in the u.s. there's HIPPA

458
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,620
compliance that's if we consider right

459
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,509
here Canadian compliance is PIPA done

460
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:14,418
it's basically level compliance this

461
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:16,669
year and GDP are is way up here so it's

462
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,080
a big step up and and for us having a

463
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,360
first mover advantage of gathering data

464
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,980
and being cloud based and only keeping

465
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,869
in data only residing in Canada and

466
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,870
never leaving the country on servers

467
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:28,699
here as we go into the UK or into

468
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:32,178
Germany or anywhere in the in the EU we

469
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:36,519
have to be gdpr compliant and we are now

470
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:39,740
so we're almost are now interesting ok I

471
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,569
think data is a it's a it's a big big

472
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,000
point and that's where the game is

473
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:46,158
changing and I hope you write and when

474
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,779
Israel also coming and I think we headed

475
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,179
already earlier in the conference but

476
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,710
somebody was talking about Israel how

477
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:53,720
much data they gathering they're doing

478
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,048
it for 20 years I think this is really

479
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,669
really something what is important and

480
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:01,819
needed and I said it already in the

481
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:03,759
beginning collaboration is the key I

482
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:07,250
would say combining different

483
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,200
jurisdictions see what what works do

484
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,759
experiments I mean Germany is the

485
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,120
experiment for Europe in terms of the

486
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,349
patient numbers and sort of inserting

487
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:19,639
inserting products from all over the all

488
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:24,349
over the world so yeah I see I see data

489
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:28,090
is key and we should be exchanging more

490
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:30,918
more of the data and I'm looking forward

491
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:33,980
maybe working more closely with you in

492
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,020
the future ok yes or no answer to this

493
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:43,880
question and then we'll open it up to

494
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:47,339
questions the cannabis production yes or

495
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,450
no is it a race to the bottom

496
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,908
making me put me on the spot without

497
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,590
he's got an answer - yeah I mean sadly

498
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,269
the reality is it is right now

499
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:57,908
I think it'll stabilize at some point

500
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:59,380
but you know at this point every

501
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:02,049
producer can sell everything that they

502
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,970
grow there's just so much demand at some

503
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:05,440
point there'll be enough supply to

504
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,460
service the market and I don't know when

505
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,409
that is but at some point there'll be

506
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,090
enough supply to service the market and

507
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,559
companies are gonna have to figure out

508
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:13,658
how to differentiate their products from

509
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:15,609
others and it's a very hard Mauri I'm an

510
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:18,250
IP lawyer so it's very difficult to

511
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,869
actually protect a particular cultivar

512
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,278
because somebody can just come up with a

513
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:24,189
formulation that's slightly different

514
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:28,000
and it's no longer covered sir the same

515
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:31,000
question yes just for an example for

516
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,009
Germany in 2018 we had 3.1 tonnes of

517
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,648
cannabis flower material which was

518
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:39,220
distributed this year we are probably at

519
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:42,729
five to six next it's going to be again

520
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,850
doubled let's say 12 tonnes for whole of

521
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:49,569
Germany and if I just see what amounts

522
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:51,519
are currently grown there will be a huge

523
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:53,349
enamel I'm not afraid but it will be a

524
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,259
huge challenge to sort of differentiate

525
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:57,250
different products but let's look at

526
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,009
Greece Weathers

527
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:03,128
where there are hundred tons grown

528
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:05,259
another Spain coming in Portugal can

529
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:08,288
Canada's there nobody knows what's going

530
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:12,700
to happen with the with the US and short

531
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,950
notice and so yeah it's going to be a

532
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,019
huge challenge in terms also of the

533
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,509
pricing and competitiveness because they

534
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:21,759
are also Eastern European countries

535
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:24,278
coming in north methadone yeah Poland

536
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,528
which are produced at really really low

537
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:28,648
cost so let's see how it turns out I

538
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:31,628
don't have a require answer to that

539
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:34,298
question but yeah thank you yes so your

540
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:37,178
fight answers right the German yes and

541
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:39,490
though it's every technical okay there

542
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:44,710
any folks let's hear it for the panel

543
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:47,798
first of all right away I have a quick

544
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:50,620
question first you mentioned to IP as in

545
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,089
respect to cannabis strains how is it

546
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:53,678
even possible how do you how do you

547
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:55,029
patent train wreck how do you patent

548
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,100
bubble cush how do you

549
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:59,259
patent blue dream like I mean cannabis

550
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:02,109
hands have been with the open source for

551
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:03,970
the longest time and it's just it's

552
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:05,500
weird to me to see people try to if

553
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,089
anybody's ever done a patent before you

554
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,250
know it's there there's a there's a long

555
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:11,439
process to it it's yours and it costs a

556
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,900
lot of money and not everybody can

557
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240
afford to patent a strain and if you

558
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,950
were to take a particular if you went

559
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,289
through the effort to genetically test

560
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,569
your product and and that means beyond

561
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:23,829
just you know CBD and THC but if you

562
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,710
actually go through the effort and look

563
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:28,990
at the full chemical profile and you

564
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,730
patent that that's great you're gonna

565
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,900
spend fifteen twenty five thousand

566
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,880
dollars on that it'll take a couple

567
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,440
years and then somebody's gonna change

568
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,910
the formulation by slightly than one

569
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
slight different amount and then you're

570
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,870
no longer covered so I don't think it's

571
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,240
patentable hi

572
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:45,849
are you guys talking what about the

573
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,490
Caribbean market because I know love you

574
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:50,230
guys and Caribbean right now but here

575
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,859
you mention nothing about the Caribbean

576
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,589
market

577
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:55,299
well I also think the Antarctica market

578
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:59,169
has potential but we can't discuss

579
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:01,079
everything to answer your question so I

580
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,970
think that's a huge market and

581
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,970
unfortunately none of us are technically

582
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,100
working in that jurisdiction well there

583
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:12,100
are a lot of guys with you in the region

584
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:13,899
right now oh I have a number of people

585
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:16,149
in this room I know who are working in

586
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,180
Jamaica right now but I've never had in

587
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:22,509
there and but I will say this is that

588
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:25,330
the Caribbean has a huge role to play in

589
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:28,390
the cannabis industry because it will

590
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:30,789
allow a lot of companies to do what's

591
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,860
called they'll be eligible for something

592
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:35,230
called a citizen's Investment Bureau

593
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:37,359
passport program meaning that if you

594
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:40,420
show up in Antigua Barbuda and say hi

595
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,579
government like to give you our IP I'd

596
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,440
also like to talk to you about a

597
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:47,710
distribution agreement and in return

598
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,450
we're now eligible for your citizens

599
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,450
investment for your passport scheme

600
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,360
happy but the point I'm trying to make

601
00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:00,089
is is yes you're going to see a lot of

602
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,589
places that use the Caribbean for

603
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:03,569
cannabis just like they're going to use

604
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:05,909
the Caribbean for banking services which

605
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:08,909
means it's going to be a very central

606
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,420
hub either way thank you all right over

607
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,690
here

608
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,670
you're welcome not a question about

609
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,200
strategic partner out of question about

610
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,170
strategic partnerships so you kind of

611
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,750
mentioned the tribes I had submitted a

612
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,789
tokenize a tribal tokenized asset in

613
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,430
California with the collateral being a

614
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,710
blunt rolling machine with the idea of

615
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,090
combining tobacco and cannabis they

616
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,009
didn't like the idea maybe it was too

617
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:35,159
soon and so I'm curious about your

618
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:38,809
opinions in utilizing Native American

619
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:42,000
tribes in North America and combining

620
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:43,349
cannabis with you know tobacco so

621
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,299
individuality that's normalized

622
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:47,609
professionalized you guys see that as

623
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,230
being an option I know that Germany is

624
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,490
probably never going to allow that but

625
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,529
it's popular with spliffs

626
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,359
but do you guys see blunts you know

627
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,099
tobacco and cannabis eventually being

628
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,289
combined together there's a massive

629
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:00,179
tobacco production facility on Six

630
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:02,399
Nations and in Hamilton outside of

631
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,480
Toronto and if you've ever been there

632
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,370
it's one of the largest production

633
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,120
tobacco production facilities in the

634
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:11,789
world and I don't think I don't there's

635
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,039
much interest in combining tobacco and

636
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:15,359
cannabis in a product but there is

637
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,220
definitely interested in utilizing their

638
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,659
infrastructure to produce cannabis to be

639
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:24,539
exported and yes cannabis is a no excuse

640
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,300
me tobacco at least in the Supreme Court

641
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:30,359
cases with First Nations have recognized

642
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:33,629
a very general right to the possession

643
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,729
of tobacco for commercial purposes for

644
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:38,810
guys van der peat I think was a Supreme

645
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,819
Court case where a guy been stockpiling

646
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,529
tobacco clearly he was going to sell it

647
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:45,269
but that was something that First

648
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:49,410
Nations we have to remember we're doing

649
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:52,440
since time immemorial before Europeans

650
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:56,130
showed up so it would that that type of

651
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,500
a scenario fought very night or fit very

652
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,750
nicely within the existing jurisprudence

653
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,880
and that's why I think cannabis isn't

654
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,670
really a too big of a stone's throw from

655
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,600
tobacco and in fact it's just one of

656
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,860
many natural medicines and

657
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,349
you know from the work that we've been

658
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:14,759
doing more of the bands are wanting to

659
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:18,339
not just take on cannabis but they want

660
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:22,240
psilocybin you know the fungi peyote

661
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:24,189
through the cacti vines ayahuasca DMT

662
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,740
which accrue know all of these natural

663
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,480
practices that I think they will be able

664
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,059
to do a whole host of commercial

665
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,610
endeavors under food social and

666
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:35,409
ceremonial thank you for your question

667
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:37,059
yeah no it's currently done in in

668
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,430
Germany too bad there's no possibility

669
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:43,119
because known cannabis patient is

670
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:45,430
smoking cannabis in Germany no basically

671
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,199
what we have is vaporizing option or tea

672
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:50,590
option those are the things which are

673
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,450
actively known as application methods

674
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:54,490
and this is a huge problem most of the

675
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,380
doctors have because if they're giving

676
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,509
medicinal cannabis flowers to a patient

677
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,000
they always have the risk that they are

678
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:03,250
smoking it giving to their grandchildren

679
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,529
or something like that so there's no

680
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,829
option but from a scientific point of

681
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:11,319
view I think there is a yeah it it might

682
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:14,319
be a possibility to use also to tobacco

683
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:16,629
plant to find solutions of for example

684
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,849
also creating cannabinoids but that's a

685
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:25,120
very interesting talk we should do maybe

686
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:26,859
afterwards lol Oh questions my name is

687
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,259
Phil Hardy Director of Sales with craft

688
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:30,819
Depot and we're currently contracted by

689
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:32,529
50 LPS to help with wholesale

690
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:35,159
distribution and creating efficiencies

691
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:37,779
and transparency in that market LP jlp

692
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,890
my question is specifically for Linus

693
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:43,839
and it's concerning importing into

694
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:47,140
Germany or importing into the EU I've

695
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,659
heard variants of what's acceptable was

696
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:53,230
not from a GPP standpoint so if you have

697
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:56,529
a cultivator whose GPP compliant and as

698
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:59,259
is doing their post harvest in a GPP

699
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:01,059
level can they go into the EU GMP

700
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:02,379
because I've understood that this GAC P

701
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:06,549
and then once they harvest has to go

702
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:08,110
into a GMP process so I'm trying to get

703
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:09,789
some clarity because I hear people

704
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:11,379
saying it was cheap EP all the way till

705
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:14,170
it's packaged in kilos it can move

706
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,240
overseas and I've heard that say no it

707
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,970
has to be GAC P at harvest

708
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,269
down moving into GMP for your curing

709
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:24,640
drying and and packaging and then that

710
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:27,400
can move into the EU can you speak to

711
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,440
that a little bit yeah sure I mean there

712
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,110
are a lot of things a lot of rumors

713
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,500
coming around G ACP is it possible not

714
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:39,729
currently there is no G ACP grown

715
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:42,700
product in a German market so what you

716
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,160
need is a new GMP certified facility is

717
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,750
the best would be by a by a German

718
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,570
Authority currently waiting times are

719
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:52,630
year 12 month at least at our authority

720
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:55,859
where we are working with then your your

721
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:59,140
safe and can sort of distribute also

722
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:01,719
prepackaged medicinal cannabis products

723
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,280
and then all the qualification and the

724
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,819
medical approval will be done inside

725
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,529
Germany the products will be then get an

726
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:10,240
additional label on it and you can

727
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:12,359
distribute enema Germany that's the

728
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,150
easiest way there are now things

729
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:20,529
discussed if it's possible to sort of

730
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:23,080
grow GAC P certified products have them

731
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:26,200
extracted as an at an EU GMP certified

732
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,659
facility packaged labeled and then sent

733
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,600
to Germany but it's not yet possible but

734
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,790
this is I think a feasible solution

735
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:36,250
because GAC P is easy and I don't think

736
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:38,558
everything needs to be grown indoors

737
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:41,558
greenhouses is an alternative which is

738
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,269
also used in Israel for example thank

739
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:45,849
you very much so then just for further

740
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,799
clarification as well a GPP cultivator

741
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:49,799
just with the cultivation license who

742
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,178
then sells to an EU GMP certified

743
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,129
processor who then creates those

744
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:57,100
products and then they can export is

745
00:31:54,130 --> 00:32:00,370
that a possibility is that as a supply

746
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:02,558
chain that works as I said every process

747
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:04,659
so every process every supply chain is

748
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,779
tested itself so for example if we are

749
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,130
now coming together and you give me an

750
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,379
an overview of the products you would

751
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:15,130
like to import I have to get that import

752
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:17,050
license based on those products exactly

753
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,920
on all the information all the lab tests

754
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:23,169
you have what we do is we usually do a

755
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,539
sample shipment have it tested in

756
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:32,019
Germany and directly

757
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:33,670
yeah burned basically disposed and then

758
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,799
we sort of test all the processes

759
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,600
because German authorities feel way more

760
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:39,609
comfortable if they are tested by a

761
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,069
German lab and have been tested by a

762
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:45,490
qualified person so it always suggests

763
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:47,679
use a distributor where you have GMP

764
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,620
knowledge and who have already done

765
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,360
those sample shipments and understand

766
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:53,199
the process there are a lot of people

767
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,319
running around

768
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,900
currently there are 13 licenses of users

769
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,509
including us so be careful good talk you

770
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,720
talk question thank you perfect thank

771
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:06,670
you do we have time for one more is that

772
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,069
it and someone has a brief one anyone

773
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,420
have a short question is that you

774
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:10,990
raising your hand over there all right

775
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,390
here we go

776
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:16,269
what are we good one last question

777
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:22,509
please be brief to the variable B right

778
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:24,190
here here we go just a question about

779
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:26,740
Germany and what a free is doing

780
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,970
so if RIA has a distribution license one

781
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,009
of the one of the 14 and Germany they

782
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,569
spoke of and from my understanding a

783
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:33,910
free is just purchasing products from

784
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:36,159
Switzerland and getting the distribution

785
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,080
revenue for it from a company called

786
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,490
blossom and basically they're just

787
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,220
getting those companies and flipping

788
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,630
them for pennies on the dollar my

789
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,789
question is like what do you think about

790
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,770
that strategy for companies like a free

791
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:49,960
and yourself long term who are basically

792
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:52,420
using the distribution network to create

793
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,160
revenue and so basically what we've set

794
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,450
up I mean we have solely focused on

795
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,009
distribution at the moment we are doing

796
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,039
some scientific work as well with the

797
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:01,839
tobacco for example but where we see

798
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,240
ourselves we see ourselves as an entry

799
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,009
gate for Europe we of course can

800
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,870
distribute to pharmacies we are very

801
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:09,639
well connected to the biggest pharmacies

802
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:11,710
in the cannabis space we're the only

803
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:16,690
distributor who is part of the network

804
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:19,240
of cannabis pharmacies in Germany so we

805
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:21,429
think we have a good overview of the

806
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:23,439
market and sort of know how it's how

807
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,690
it's working out currently the process

808
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,010
is not that much regulated that

809
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,190
something like this can happen so

810
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:32,860
exporting for example from from from

811
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,610
Switzerland those are mainly I think

812
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:38,570
also CVD products which are sold in

813
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,180
Germany as aroma oils and it

814
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:44,570
has to say that it's not it should not

815
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:46,190
be taken orally at any time so what

816
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,530
they're currently doing for the aroma

817
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,990
oils in CBD is they put it on on a

818
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,540
pillow and then smell it through the

819
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:55,519
pillow that's that's how it's currently

820
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:57,019
the application method should be of

821
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:01,159
course you can easily take those

822
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:02,989
products but I mean we have huge

823
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:06,019
problems with the novel food that's a

824
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:08,539
completely different story so I think it

825
