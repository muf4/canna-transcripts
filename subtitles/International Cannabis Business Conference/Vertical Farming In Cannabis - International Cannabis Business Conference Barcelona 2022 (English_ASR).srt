00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,599
and the ceo of grow glide and he's going

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,359
to talk about vertical integration into

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,839
your cannabis farming

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,278
he's back there let's hear it for travis

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,278
schwartz

00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,839
trevor schwartz

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,879
charlie hodge

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,359
you got it just grab one of those

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,358
microphones

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,039
how's it going today everybody

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,439
uh my name is travis schwartz i'm here

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,200
with uh growglide uh i think we're gonna

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,558
need a minute while they uh sort out

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
some slide situation

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,440
um all right so here we go thank you

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
all right let's catch up so here you can

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,399
see the what's a single tube what we

21
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,198
would consider a single tier versus a

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,039
multi-tier it's two or more

23
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,159
today we're going to talk about a few

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,920
different subjects we're going to talk

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,878
about california

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,719
and how

27
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,119
vertical is taken off there of the

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,960
cannabis capital of the world

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,039
reasons why to go vertical

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,118
lessons learned from our time in the us

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,118
doing vertical and the european

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,118
advantage

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,759
um in california was a pioneer for

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
cannabis in the united states and this

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,439
market continues to be one of the

36
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:27,759
strongest to date

37
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,839
in this picture you are sorry

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
and this picture is kind of uh how in

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,439
the early days there were a few

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,439
large there were very few large scale

41
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,719
black marker grows

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,199
here you're seeing

43
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,719
what we would call a typical

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,759
single tiered

45
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,719
primarily hps dominated

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,959
image

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,359
most of these were as i said small scale

48
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,199
really simple to set up

49
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,879
also called trap grows

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
and most people were just kind of doing

51
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,839
what worked mentally

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,519
in late 2018 the industry started to

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,799
evolve you started to see multi-tier

54
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,118
coming out

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,680
many of the first

56
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,719
solution providers were storage

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
innovators

58
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,000
who made slight changes to their product

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,560
and labeled them for indoor growing

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,159
picture here is a kind of generation one

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
of a grow glide rack

62
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,439
with integrated

63
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,598
drainage and

64
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,359
sloped drainage system

65
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,719
and obviously they're on wheels to

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
optimize the floor's base

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,680
there's a very robust market going

68
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,399
forward in the last 18 months we've seen

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,319
vertical cannabis explode

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,159
most investors no longer tolerate single

71
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,318
tier build builds

72
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,680
and growers have adapted to complexity

73
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,958
vertical cultivation in the united

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,640
states

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,719
it's almost impossible to gauge the

76
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,199
market potential of the future for new

77
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,280
builds but we've determined that the

78
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,119
old single-tiered market that can be

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
converted is roughly 2 billion

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
this is one of my favorite pictures this

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,840
is actually some of the guys from jungle

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
boys and the cure company they're

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
visiting one of our customers in long

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
beach california this picture is taken

85
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,039
on the third tier which

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,719
which about five meters up

87
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,479
many people would believe that you can't

88
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,598
grow quality product in a multi-tier

89
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,039
environment

90
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,439
hopefully you can see from this picture

91
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,359
that that is in fact not true

92
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,639
the key to the success is proper

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,280
planning

94
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,279
and products

95
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,878
but we're going to touch on the vertical

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,640
advantage so by going vertical

97
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,280
you obviously can increase your roi by

98
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,479
up to 300 or more

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,560
many times cultivation licensing is tied

100
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,560
to an actual single address

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,719
so by utilizing your existing height and

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,239
floor space you can increase the roi

103
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,239
without additional licenses

104
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,929
last but not least environmentally with

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,039
proper planning and vertical

106
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,120
[Music]

107
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:01,158
growers can minimize land waste

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,158
power waste and water waste

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
as an entrepreneur i know firsthand how

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,000
exciting it is to build a new business

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
and how quickly it can fall apart if you

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,080
skip over the details so the lessons

113
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,560
that we've learned is planning planning

114
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
and planning

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,478
poor planning leads to poor performance

116
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,039
obviously we love multi-tier and are

117
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,240
huge advocates however it's not a magic

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
cure-all

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
proper preparation is critical

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,519
sorry proper

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
proper preparation is critical to the

122
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,279
success of your vertical grow and the

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
benefits that you all want to achieve

124
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,399
these three key issues that we're going

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,478
to cover next are the difference between

126
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,000
a vertical grow that's successful and a

127
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,918
never-ending headache

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,319
those three key things are going to be

129
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,319
workflow microclimates and safety

130
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,800
workflow is obviously from the beginning

131
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,120
designing to your building to thinking

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,879
about your team's best efficiencies

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,360
workflow is going to be crucial

134
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,959
microclimates is by far the number one

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,520
biggest issue that people don't think

136
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,439
about when they go to a multi-tier grow

137
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,079
you have the issues with

138
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,680
humidity and temperature

139
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,120
across the different levels throughout

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,800
the room

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,800
and growing excel is great growing at

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,240
quality is better

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
proper air flow is going to be the

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,360
number one biggest thing which i just

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,279
mentioned

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,919
and you've got to get that air to move

147
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,599
around both within the layer and up and

148
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,359
down so

149
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
there's a few solutions on the market

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
happy to talk about those more later

151
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,120
and then last but not least is safety so

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,280
your cultivation team is going to be

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
working at you know heights up to 15 20

154
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,799
feet off the ground how are they

155
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,520
protected what are the safety processes

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
you have in place

157
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,439
the european advantage

158
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,439
is

159
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
obvious in that the

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
you guys have had the

161
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
the advantage of

162
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,199
being first to market and really

163
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,079
innovative in the agriculture space

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
um

165
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,560
also you can watch and learn from some

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
of the mistakes that we've made from the

167
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,079
early pioneers of vertical cannabis in

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
the united states

169
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,318
so europe's big ag industry

170
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
uh has some major innovators from the

171
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
inn farms to the nordic harvest these

172
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,758
companies are really making headlines

173
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,519
today and for the last decade

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,840
cannabis cultivators can lean on this

175
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,519
open attitude and really skip the single

176
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,439
tier growing phase

177
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,719
the u.s is currently transitioning out

178
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,959
of

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,160
some of you may have had the chance to

180
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,478
meet our new team member uh but ludwig

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,639
uh simone is joining us who is the head

182
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,199
of operations at one of the largest uh

183
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,280
vertical farming ag operations here in

184
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,038
europe and he's joined groveglide's team

185
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,879
as a gm of europe so if you haven't had

186
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,918
a chance to catch him uh come see him in

187
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,918
our booth number one

188
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,478
uh so now i'm going to kind of cover

189
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,800
some of the predictions that i

190
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,680
anticipate to happen in europe as it

191
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,160
relates to vertical cultivation

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
uh based on the experience in the u.s

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
so obviously the demand for european

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,598
cannabis will be cannabis will be robust

195
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,159
as jamie pearson mentioned this morning

196
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,159
it's likely to be very underestimated

197
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,880
germany on its own has the potential to

198
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
be a four billion dollar market

199
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,478
secondly the u.s multi-tier is rapidly

200
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,918
going to continue to shift uh to

201
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,560
a higher count of tiers and they're

202
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,719
going to focus on utilizing sas software

203
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
solutions to ensure consistency and

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,919
quality throughout their products

205
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,560
there will be continued to be

206
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,560
consolidation among multi-tier vendors

207
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,800
and as i believe that flour will always

208
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,400
remain king from a product standpoint

209
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,360
extraction which requires high volume of

210
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,079
flour

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,639
to make various products from resins to

212
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,318
rosins to edibles etc

213
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,478
those are going to continue to skyrocket

214
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,280
as the mature the market in europe

215
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,279
continues to mature

216
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,079
cannabis is going to be a true cash crop

217
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
driving further innovation through over

218
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,399
the in the overall ag tech market

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,960
the overlap between ag and cannabis

220
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,279
cultivation will continue to increase

221
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,038
and at this point i believe that

222
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,198
vertical ag is actually starting to

223
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,399
learn from vertical cannabis versus the

224
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
other way around it's been going for the

225
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,878
last decade

226
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
more technology tools will continue to

227
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,479
be created to help

228
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,080
cultivators plan

229
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,000
a successful operation from that

230
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,000
workflow climate and safety standpoint

231
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,679
i'm stealing this idea from jamie

232
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
pearson but we're going to have lots of

233
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,519
time for questions here so this is a

234
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,399
quick qr code in case somebody wants to

235
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,159
download this presentation to learn more

236
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,519
but i'd love to open it up to any types

237
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,399
of questions that people have as it

238
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,399
relates to vertical ag airflow workflow

239
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,080
anything along those fronts

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,919
and um

241
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,399
yeah i know i speak really fast so i'm

242
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,399
sorry for that

243
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,320
young lady in the red

244
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,159
[Applause]

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,080
how much time do i have to give you in

246
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,559
order to

247
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,879
have you prepare what i need how much

248
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,239
advanced time do wait let's do it into

249
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,399
the microphone hold on a minute i'm

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,799
sorry i was

251
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,120
if i'm building out a grow

252
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,719
how much time do i have to give you when

253
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
at what point in the process do i need

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,080
to come

255
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,720
talk to you about

256
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
what i need

257
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,439
thank you for that that's a great

258
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,640
question um

259
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,200
so to go back to the planning phase um

260
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,360
as early as possible you know we have

261
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,640
cultivators who come to us who

262
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
uh

263
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,319
haven't had they don't have a building

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,519
yet um ideally you're in the planning

265
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,240
phase before really anything has been

266
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,519
done a lot of times our team is uh very

267
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,039
knowledgeable from we have a lot of

268
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,720
cultivators on the team and they can

269
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,838
actually help you kind of design your

270
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,759
project around workflow um

271
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
generally we're seeing people talking to

272
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,519
us anywhere from

273
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
i would say eight to 12 months before

274
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,959
their facility is actually they're ready

275
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,200
to install the the racking system um

276
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,199
but it also comes we have people who

277
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,800
show up a month before they need it so

278
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,079
the more planning the better success

279
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,078
you're gonna have in the long run for

280
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,078
sure

281
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,679
any other questions plan ahead everyone

282
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,120
i always tell people especially in this

283
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,120
industry start early you're high

284
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
you guys all waiting for the translation

285
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,879
to go through

286
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,639
have you learned everything you can

287
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,078
today no more no one has any questions

288
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,039
at all

289
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,838
no

290
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,559
does it triple your yields

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,920
at least at least

292
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,759
all right that's all the questions i had

293
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,759
then do you have another question jimmy

294
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,240
is there anything that you've been asked

295
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,559
here that's been surprising when you

296
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,959
were out on the expo hall that

297
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,838
has given you pause about what's

298
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,838
happening in europe

299
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,480
that's a great question i think that um

300
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
the most notable thing that i've learned

301
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
is that

302
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
some areas are far they're much farther

303
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,479
ahead

304
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
than i would have anticipated as far as

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
places that are operational

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,879
um

307
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
and

308
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,240
i've also heard from a handful of people

309
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,000
who seem to have more knowledge in the

310
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,720
space than i that

311
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,720
germany likely will take longer to

312
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,959
to get uh recreational open than they

313
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
anticipate just due to the kind of the

314
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,039
things going on in the world right now

315
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,639
so i think that both the positive and

316
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,240
negative the negative being germany is

317
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,839
going to be behind but everywhere else

318
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,039
seems to be

319
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,959
much more

320
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,120
ahead or prepared

321
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,838
can you retrofit

322
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,120
existing grows

323
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,720
that's a great question i mean you

324
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,039
definitely can

325
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,200
you definitely can retrofit obviously

326
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,838
you're you're going to have

327
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,759
limitations to deal with whether that's

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,240
um what your ceiling height is that's

329
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,838
generally your biggest limit um secondly

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
do you have enough power to convert to a

331
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,800
multi-tier

332
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,839
from both the lighting perspective and

333
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,838
the hvac perspective

334
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,600
jump in if anyone else has questions

335
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,600
but i have a question another one can

336
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,879
you do this with sodium halogen lights

337
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,959
or does it have to be led

338
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,320
uh yeah that's a good one uh you

339
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,000
definitely can

340
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,560
my co-founder darren actually started

341
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,120
with hps uh for multi-tier you just need

342
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,638
probably an extra 12 to 18 inches per

343
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
tier in order to be able to have the

344
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,399
spacing to do so

345
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
but it's 100 possible

346
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,039
how many tiers can you go up

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,360
uh you're unlimited based on your

348
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,838
ceiling height um we've done up to six

349
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,079
tiers before i probably need about 28

350
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,680
feet which is

351
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,199
about nine i think uh meters

352
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,679
but most people don't most people are in

353
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,200
that fifty you need about 15 feet to do

354
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,599
two tiers 12 to 15 and ideally 18 to 20

355
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,079
feet uh so five and a half meters uh to

356
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,480
do three tiered system for flower

357
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,359
systems are nowadays like roguelites is

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,759
very

359
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,839
adjustable so you can fit it into

360
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,639
two-inch increments to come up with

361
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,360
whatever size you you need so our motto

362
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,639
is to help growers grow how they want to

363
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
not tell them how they need to

364
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,319
do you guys give

365
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,078
virtual help so you don't necessarily

366
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
have to go right to the physical grow

367
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,000
you can do this

368
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,759
like somebody in europe if you're back

369
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,679
in america they can

370
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,360
you can work with them uh over zoom

371
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,120
uh yeah that's actually how we work with

372
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
most of our customers we have a full

373
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,039
team of about 10 on our solutions team

374
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,440
who's able to walk you through the

375
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,198
process get you

376
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
the specifications for me that you would

377
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,479
need

378
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,240
over zoom we have some really cool room

379
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,240
generation tools where you can kind of

380
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,360
see your product uh in real time and we

381
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
we

382
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,759
also send out um

383
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,239
we have some virtual reality type

384
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:26,159
applications to where you can see a 360

385
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,159
view of your uh of the product

386
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,559
all right are there any more questions

387
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,480
oh fine i'll put the one in the back

388
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,518
i was texting my friend in arizona i was

389
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,199
about to do a 25 000. we can't hear you

390
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
just wait i'm on my way i wore the

391
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,278
comfortable shoes

392
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,759
simple question just texting my friend

393
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,679
in arizona who's doing 25 000 square

394
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,278
foot four-tier grow

395
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,559
and he's like this sounds fascinating

396
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,439
where can i come

397
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,759
see this guy and what he can do

398
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,600
yeah so we're based out of riverside

399
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,439
southern california

400
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,079
so we have a full showroom there we have

401
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,839
about 70 cultivations that we've

402
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,239
installed in the last 12 months totaling

403
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,560
about a half a million square feet

404
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,759
those are spread about across about 12

405
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,518
states

406
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,838
and we do have a handful of those

407
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
customers who will allow like scheduled

408
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,800
visits

409
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,159
so i'd say southern california and we

410
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,838
could probably swing one in arizona

411
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,159
potentially

412
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,160
thank you

413
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,039

415
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,480

to this conference because vertical

417
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,360
farming will be

418
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,639
the future in terms of protection of the

419
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,519
the lands

420
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,198
and

421
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,320
in terms of

422
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,559

quality of life of course we need more

424
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,439
