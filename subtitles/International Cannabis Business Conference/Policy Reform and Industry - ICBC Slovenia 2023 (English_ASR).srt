00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,118
to tell you the truth we won't even be

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,040
here at this Gathering right now if it

32
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,420
wasn't uh for beauja down so let's give

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,420
our esteem panel members around

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,079
foreign

35
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:40,140
so there's a few different aspects of uh

36
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:44,219
policy reform and Industry industry when

37
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,379
it comes to Slovenia this is a a very

38
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,700
hot topic right now it's obviously why

39
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,920
we're here

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,439
um we're fortunate enough to have uh

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,859
analogous models to look for or look to

42
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,959
uh like Germany uh like Switzerland like

43
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,159
certain uh other countries in Europe

44
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,899
right now that are moving forward

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,899
obviously Germany's the big one

46
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:09,538
I want to start with you

47
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,060
um and just what's your take right now

48
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:16,579
on what's going on

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,080
in in Slovenia and uh what what what

50
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,420
how do you think we're what's the most

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,599
important thing things that you think we

52
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:28,139
need to do to move forward as one of the

53
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:31,699
uh if not the original uh granddaddy of

54
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,699
activist streets activist

55
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,959
um

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,819
yeah it's a Slovenian double entender

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,098
but uh

58
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,619
um but uh what's your opinion on the

59
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,318
matter uh right now in Slovenia

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,080
uh

61
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:52,098
as most of the world or Europe we still

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,080
have very confused uh and very old

63
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:59,699
legislation about everything so it's

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,459
hard to do any research uh back in 2000

65
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,799
we accepted the law about the

66
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,039
criminalization of use of any drugs

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,140
including cannabis but after this

68
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,979
actually got worse

69
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,359
so we are now

70
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:18,299
tried to

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,720
because

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,300
before the 2000 it wasn't really a

73
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,180
criminal offense it was just not

74
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,080
accepted but the society

75
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,140
but when we implemented that law then

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,840
actually it started the criminalization

77
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:40,079
of users so it's the same like in the

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,140
states your world until then it was okay

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,680
but unfortunately this criminalization

80
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:50,098
or destigmatization of cannabis went all

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,200
the way to research and the research was

82
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,658
never prohibited until the single

83
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:58,199
convention actually but for research you

84
00:03:54,658 --> 00:04:00,899
need certain you know documentation for

85
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,179
Ministries and bureaucrats and so on and

86
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,158
you could not come true you heard the

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,099
story of Professor Neibauer about the

88
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:12,959
you know clinical study where he cannot

89
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:16,079
move forward for years and I really

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,000
think it's not okay so I think that we

91
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,379
should change the whole legislation on

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,779
the field of drugs not just cannabis

93
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:27,899
because we do much more harm to people

94
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,779
than they have benefit of it prohibition

95
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:33,959
being a failed policy in general in

96
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:38,879
Casper uh can you can you tell us what

97
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:42,779
are some of the the uh I guess statutory

98
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,879
hurdles one might say in terms of the UN

99
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,079
and the eu's perspective on this and

100
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,600
what are some

101
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,639
what are some hurdles that were that we

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,360
and other countries might be facing

103
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,939
right now in Europe when it comes to

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,120
modernizing cannabis policy

105
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:04,800
yeah uh so as already my colleague

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,360
explained uh it's it's really hard to

107
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
we generally speak like about

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,280
legalization but it's it's something

109
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,739
that's really hard to achieve because we

110
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,159
have the on the UN level we have the 61

111
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,918
and 71 and 88 convention which all

112
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,340
basically prohibits cannabis for all use

113
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,198
except for medical and research

114
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:27,418
of course we have the EU legislation

115
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,419
with the schenken agreement being the

116
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:33,839
the biggest one which also prohibits and

117
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:35,819
recalls to the U.N conventions uh then

118
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,519
of course every member State already

119
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:41,579
also has its own legislation which is a

120
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,519
bit different so there is no one

121
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,319
cannabis legislation in you in Europe or

122
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,379
in in the member states even though we

123
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,180
have two let's say legislative steps

124
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,360
above it

125
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,600
um the U.N and the and the in the

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,180
European legislation so it's

127
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,340
it's a bit confusing also for the for

128
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,160
the researchers at the end for the

129
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:08,038
consumers uh and I think it's not okay

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,060
so so what's this idea so what is okay

131
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:15,180
as far as I understand is doing for

132
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,100
research and medical purposes

133
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,160
uh Bojo could you explain a little bit

134
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,259
what that entails what that means yeah

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,080
if uh actually Slovenia already adopted

136
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:31,500
cannabis into

137
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:34,318
into drugs which are accessible to the

138
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,899
medical system back in 2017.

139
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,000
but except professional bar and maybe

140
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,099
one of two his colleagues you cannot

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,120
find a doctor who will prescribe

142
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,120
so and nowadays I think because of this

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,519
situation the patients are even in in

144
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:57,478
worse situation that was it was 10 years

145
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,719
ago and in a verse that it should be

146
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,399
because

147
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,759
with uh

148
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,579
the stigmatization of cannabis and with

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,340
the attitude of Ministry of Health or

150
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:15,560
better to say bureaucrats and minister

151
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,560
of Health doctors uh

152
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,638
do not dare to prescribe cannabis

153
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,860
because they can have problems so this

154
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,759
is a big mess I think it's all over the

155
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,479
world

156
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,639
and but I hope that Slovenia as many

157
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:33,899
other countries will follow German model

158
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,478
which is I think for the time being

159
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,698
best what we can achieve inside the

160
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,060
European Union and with I think

161
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,038
followers as usual I'd actually like to

162
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,079
talk about that in a little bit um

163
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:49,680
because there's what what are we going

164
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,079
to do uh what policy uh will we abide by

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,180
uh will we get behind to push in

166
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,978
Slovenia to modernize its cannabis

167
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,959
policy but there's also the big question

168
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:03,839
of how that's going to happen uh Boston

169
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,818
uh you you you know Politics as well as

170
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,939
anybody I reckon in this in this country

171
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,740
For Better or For Worse and uh you know

172
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,959
like like

173
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,360
how do we do it I think there's a lot of

174
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,399
you know up to this point we're hitting

175
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,080
certain walls and certain things you

176
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,839
know what are your some some of your

177
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,698
suggestions of how Dynamic we can be in

178
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,799
terms of uh getting this achieved

179
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,720
without knowing exactly what we want to

180
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,879
achieve but what's what's some what's

181
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,240
that process kind of look like

182
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,580
oh well thank you I'm glad to be here

183
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,860
um I don't know if I know Politics as

184
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,459
good as anyone I'm in politics for four

185
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:45,480
years now too much of course but

186
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:49,379
um law is always resembles of a resemble

187
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,720
of interests so it always depends what

188
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:54,419
the interest of the populations our

189
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,320
population are and what the interest of

190
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:03,659
the governing party or the uh government

191
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:06,778
is and usually you have some real events

192
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:10,139
that resemble in legislation or you have

193
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:12,600
legislation that imposes action to

194
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,360
people what I've heard now we have

195
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,420
people to use

196
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,580
marijuana or cannabis and we have

197
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,439
doctors that could but they don't

198
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,399
prescribe it so we have this double

199
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,940
problem uh even if you get knowledge out

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,659
that it can be useful we should use it

201
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,339
or can help in many aspects you always

202
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,338
have bureaucrats and bureaucrats are

203
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,700
made and that's something that's not

204
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:44,640
only for known for Slovenia a status quo

205
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,060
so we don't change anything we don't

206
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,699
take responsibility we can't be hurt or

207
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,278
punished or sanctioned and that's almost

208
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,259
this is almost a cultural thing it is it

209
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,338
is but it's not only

210
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:02,278
um in in Slovenia it's a general problem

211
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:04,500
so what we have to do is we have to get

212
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,399
knowledge out

213
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,379
um

214
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,679
conference like this is great

215
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:14,220
opportunity of course

216
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,719
following other people's examples if

217
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,060
Germany could do it

218
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,320
can do it we can too because we're in

219
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,139
the same

220
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,060
Union so I think that's the best

221
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,759
approach if

222
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:30,719
my personal opinion and I'm not here as

223
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:33,059
Deputy Mayor to be frank I was warned to

224
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,639
emphasize that

225
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,958
even though I can't even inhale to be

226
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,458
honest

227
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,979
um but um

228
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:44,819
what I think the good approach would be

229
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,339
my honest opinion if uh political party

230
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,620
would say we will decriminalize that or

231
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,440
we will make it really liberal that

232
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,100
would be a political suicide so what we

233
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,620
what has to be done in the backstage

234
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,800
they should agree on the positive

235
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,200
effects they should let's say stimulate

236
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,740
conferences like this and afterwards

237
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,620
come with a political legal solution

238
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,740
that would be my advice

239
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:17,879
yeah so and in the past in Slovenia it

240
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:22,019
hasn't uh been that way a lot of the uh

241
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:24,240
propositions coming from from uh the

242
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,839
activist Community have not necessarily

243
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,659
coalesced well with the the political

244
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,579
aspect of this would you say that's true

245
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:37,199
um by all means and not only in this

246
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:39,778
area everywhere if you don't get real

247
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,320
pressure from from the people from the

248
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:45,480
water voters then you have to have some

249
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,899
other incentive for the political

250
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,820
parties to get into the boat so I'm

251
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,159
curable what so what do you think that a

252
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,820
consensus would look like what is the

253
00:11:53,159 --> 00:12:01,199
incentive for people to change this this

254
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:05,700
this ever so coveted status quo well if

255
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,920
I'm again honest money always money so

256
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,860
um you know I was in the right-wing

257
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,299
government even though I'm not uh right

258
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,339
political

259
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:20,000
uh let's say a lover but I always said

260
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,820
we had this covet

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,559
applications and my statement was we

262
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,720
give 10 euros to everyone they would

263
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,419
give all personal data for free I met

264
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,120
for free for 10 euros that's what we

265
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:36,679
always do in the stores We Gather points

266
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,500
you know loyalty points we give out our

267
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,539
personal data as if it's nothing but if

268
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,879
a government imposes that that's a

269
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:48,240
negative thing so if we give money to

270
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,278
the people we get direction the same is

271
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,959
here if you give money to the people and

272
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,600
people are also in the government

273
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:57,719
regular action yeah well I really

274
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,800
appreciate your candor uh yeah let's

275
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,320
give it up

276
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,759
we like to hear that

277
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,560
you know

278
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,958
I wasn't gonna say my question was

279
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,958
rhetorical but uh

280
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,819
uh it's awesome

281
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:15,419
um so now let's talk about a little bit

282
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,720
maybe what's Transylvania do bosia

283
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:21,299
you're talking about uh doing the the uh

284
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,060
following the German model

285
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:25,740
um gospel what what would you say that

286
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:29,338
is what do you think some of the best

287
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,180
aspects of the the German model are and

288
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:36,320
this is quite a poignant uh uh question

289
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:40,620
especially after Mr Holmberg just spoke

290
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,778
so yes so regarding the German model in

291
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,360
my honest opinion they're like first

292
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:47,700
pillar model

293
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,620
is is the wrong approach so their second

294
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,778
pillar which would be the pilot project

295
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,078
that is in my opinion the the better

296
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:58,320
option and it's uh it's credential the

297
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:01,319
same project Switzerland is taking

298
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,120
um and it's in accordance with the EU

299
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,300
regulations and the European regulations

300
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,980
because it falls under research

301
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,139
um so I think that would be the best

302
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,659
approach and we can we could then

303
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,899
research because nowadays the question

304
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,699
even still is is cannabis a bad drug is

305
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,679
it good is it bad how does it affect

306
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,500
people how does it affect absenteeism

307
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,059
traffic safety and so on and so on and

308
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,078
those are the things that really could

309
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:29,518
be tested so even to get some of the I'm

310
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,899
going to say false information out of

311
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,919
the way because there's a lot of it out

312
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,399
there

313
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,519
um for example I just heard one a couple

314
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,220
of days ago I was reading a report for

315
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,698
2022 and it said that the Road Traffic

316
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,879
Safety really decreased when a country

317
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:49,500
adopted cannabis so I said well

318
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,179
where can you check that and I said okay

319
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,120
so Netherlands should have like a really

320
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:56,338
bad traffic safety and the European

321
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,980
Union actually tracks the traffic safety

322
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,899
accidents uh and the statistics is that

323
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,379
Netherlands is about 40 percent better

324
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,360
than the Europe European average so

325
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,439
obviously it doesn't maybe a spurious

326
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,440
correlation yeah

327
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,060
what do you think I just want to add

328
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,278
this you know kind of the regulation of

329
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,458
cannabis is very popular I think in

330
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,980
Slovenia since last 15 years every

331
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,799
government before the election promised

332
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,659
big things you know there were different

333
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,859
law proposals

334
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:35,819
but when this party or this Coalition of

335
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:38,699
parties come to the power you know they

336
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,839
all forget it but we are also unlucky

337
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:44,819
maybe because we have frequent change of

338
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,120
governments you know not the whole

339
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,860
mandate so it's usually two years if

340
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,120
they are lucky three if they are very

341
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,199
lucky for

342
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,720
and in such a weak political system then

343
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:03,778
the bureaucrat says bhushan said are

344
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:06,360
leading the uh the dance you know and

345
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:08,820
I don't know we cannot solve problems

346
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,120
with the same people who who made them

347
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,278
so the first thing is to I think to

348
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,179
change those people who are in charge

349
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:21,600
for drugs and so for 30 years

350
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:23,698
I think we take from what Borgia just

351
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,320
said and whatan said before

352
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:27,958
I think it's the people who need to put

353
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,260
pressure on the politics and they can

354
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:35,099
also deal with the administrative uh or

355
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:37,740
the administrators and because I think

356
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,240
putting people like Professor Neibauer

357
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,480
or other people who are treating

358
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,759
patients real life patients with heavy

359
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,399
disease and telling them listen we have

360
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,100
this patient who we could help but we

361
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,839
cannot because of some bureaucracy this

362
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,540
is how we will apply pressure to the

363
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,060
politics and then things will change so

364
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,458
Boston do you agree with that yeah

365
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,758
absolutely because people can relate to

366
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:05,159
those sets stories and they don't see

367
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:09,558
you know junkies in metalcore they see

368
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:13,679
these people that need help uh so that's

369
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:17,279
most certainly the way the way to go but

370
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,500
I have to correct or add to the my

371
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,678
previous statement I wasn't talking

372
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,140
about corruption in bribes

373
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,720
don't mix that yeah I know I know I

374
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,059
thought about it later it's it's the

375
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,039
it's the economic incentive that's

376
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:34,440
important it's the same with Texas we

377
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,779
all know if we lower taxes if we had I

378
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,000
don't know 10 flat rate companies would

379
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:42,119
come Slovenia we all know that if I talk

380
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,119
to anyone left right they all agree but

381
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,119
it's not apocalistically good thing to

382
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,759
say or to go into the Parliament and say

383
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:54,538
look we will lower taxes because we will

384
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:56,279
have lower invoices our tax

385
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:58,379
um Authority but we will have more

386
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,440
invoices that's something we all agree

387
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:05,340
but we can't put it into the parliament

388
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,740
because it's not holistically okay to

389
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,558
take less money from the

390
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,079
from the reach at the end of all from

391
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,298
the old yeah and I definitely know what

392
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,399
you meant when you said that the

393
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,859
economic incentives that because that's

394
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,019
what happened in America that's how we

395
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:25,079
legalized in America I've been an

396
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:28,679
activist since 1993 when I met Jack Hare

397
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:31,439
and he he took me under his wing and I

398
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,538
started uh and I was a activist a

399
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
volunteer signature gatherer on the

400
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:38,819
Street and our narrative at that time

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,519
was pushing cannabis for a human rights

402
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:44,819
civil liberty issues we didn't push it

403
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,859
for for money or economic incentive back

404
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,379
then we were activists and we thought

405
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,359
well this is a plant and this is our

406
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,539
body and you shouldn't be locking people

407
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,339
up for years for this and that's that's

408
00:18:54,538 --> 00:19:00,179
kind of where we were coming from from

409
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:01,740
for years until what and then what

410
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,480
happened was you had a lot of big

411
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,339
organizations come up after California

412
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,440
came in for medical

413
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,119
and just giving some context of how it

414
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,798
happened in America a little bit not

415
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,659
that that's the same analogy here but

416
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,879
there is crossover

417
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,640
um as we're legalizing in America

418
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,640
uh

419
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,679
up until the so there was before the

420
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,940
recession it was a human rights civil

421
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,038
liberties thing that's what we were

422
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,820
pushing we had big organizations like

423
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:32,940
MPP marijuana policy project and uh uh

424
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:35,099
drug policy Alliance and uh they were

425
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,840
they gave they started giving big money

426
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:38,099
to campaigns that were starting to do

427
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,839
state campaigns like you're in

428
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:41,279
California they could give you a million

429
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,720
dollars they had some billionaire

430
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,519
philanthropist whether it was Peter

431
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,839
Thiel or George Soros those are two of

432
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,220
the philanthropists behind those two

433
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,019
groups

434
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,298
um they they started giving money but

435
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,879
the but the narrative was still human

436
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:57,058
rights civil liberties it wasn't until

437
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:00,120
the recession in 207 208

438
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:02,519
that the really hit the fan uh in

439
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:06,178
America and around the world and we

440
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:09,058
really the the MPP the top activists

441
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,440
they took it they saw an opening now

442
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:13,139
we're going to push the economic

443
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,580
incentives of cannabis and that that's

444
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,380
going to be our number one thing because

445
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,240
it's political strategist you never want

446
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,760
too much messaging it'll get it'll get

447
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,859
convoluted it'll dilute itself so there

448
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,579
they started pinpointing on the economic

449
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:29,159
issues uh uh specifically and that

450
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,599
unfortunately it's still fortunately and

451
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,279
unfortunately it's still that people

452
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,000
sometimes tend to forget the human

453
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:38,839
rights aspect of of of cannabis and uh

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,140
just just individual liberty in general

455
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:45,240
however I agree completely because we

456
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,520
saw that's how that's what broke the

457
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,200
glass ceiling in America is like when

458
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,599
these municipalities and jurisdictions

459
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,360
needed extra Revenue they knew they

460
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,639
could easily get it by legalizing

461
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,918
cannabis and that was employed in the

462
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,860
strategy for legalizing cannabis let's

463
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,660
say in Colorado you say well well 10 of

464
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,339
this tax or more I don't know exactly

465
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,798
what it is it's arbitrary I don't know

466
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,538
it will go to the schools you know so

467
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,240
all of a sudden you have school we'll go

468
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:15,660
to the police so now you have police and

469
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,759
schools lobbying for uh for for your

470
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,519
Camp campaign and like I said it's not

471
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:24,779
the exact same comparison here but I

472
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,579
think that uh uh you know and I even

473
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,740
think the human rights aspect is still

474
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,359
okay to bring up in Europe because you

475
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,460
have this classic harm prevention

476
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,379
strategy over the years you're not

477
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,659
incarcerating people for personal use

478
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,159
generally in Europe whereas in America

479
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,740
traditionally in some of the Southern

480
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,080
more conservative States you can go to

481
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,359
jail with a joint there's people in

482
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,439
Louisiana right now who are rotting it

483
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:52,319
away in jail for for personal uh use

484
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,860
another country another uh States also

485
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,740
so I would uh agree that this is this is

486
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,839
about economics and uh and when you show

487
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,798
people when I say people I really mean

488
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,599
institutions uh the money they know they

489
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,400
can they know that it's it's a it's a

490
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,678
big party and they're and everybody's

491
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,460
included and one last thing I'll just

492
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,880
say

493
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,159
is uh there was a time also in America

494
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,179
and this is very different from politics

495
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:25,080
in uh in in Europe we have legal bribery

496
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:27,480
in America it's called lobbying

497
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:31,619
and it's the most corrupt way

498
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,480
to to deal with politics and uh and I've

499
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:35,879
done many I'm the first person ever to

500
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,179
do a bipartisan fundraiser as that I

501
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,280
know of in America with two Washington

502
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:42,419
congressmen uh Dana rohrbacher you were

503
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,058
there dog

504
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:48,538
the Jerry Garcia suite at the Hyatt in

505
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:50,700
San Francisco we did how apropos for all

506
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:53,220
those who know the Grateful Dead

507
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,798
um but but the first bipartisan

508
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,558
fundraiser right with uh Earl

509
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:01,200
blumenhauer the 40-year congressman for

510
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,000
uh hero from Portland and Dana rohrbach

511
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,700
or the Republican yet he was a

512
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,419
Libertarian Republican congressman who

513
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,279
was the is the hero of America he's I'm

514
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,559
not sure if there's any one politician

515
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,359
ironically enough he was Republican uh

516
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,399
that did more for you might have heard

517
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,879
of the rohrbacher uh blumenhauer

518
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,860
rohrbacher far amendment rohrbacher was

519
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,559
the one that if you couldn't change the

520
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,839
law he could reappropriate the funds

521
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:28,859
that were allocated to the law so

522
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,199
there's allocation and there's

523
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,658
appropriation right so it gets allocated

524
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,919
then it gets appropriated well they

525
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,780
stopped with the rohrbacher fire

526
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,500
Amendment they just said in a medical

527
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:42,359
marijuana states you cannot raid uh uh

528
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,759
uh you can't re but you can't use any

529
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,219
any law enforcement can't use any

530
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,619
resources for medical marijuana when

531
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,179
it's clear state law so they'd have to

532
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:53,038
be real criminals going against other

533
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,220
Rico stuff like embezzlement and and

534
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:59,038
whatnot so it's a slight digression but

535
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,538
the point is is I was there when the

536
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,759
politicians wouldn't want to touch it

537
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:04,919
only a few people like rohrbacher and

538
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,960
blumenhauer were down and so we started

539
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,940
this cannabis constituency and this

540
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,319
whole lobbying movement and then next

541
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,179
thing you know I'm raising fifty

542
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,038
thousand dollars for the governor of

543
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,320
California

544
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,419
this happened right away like over two

545
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,678
year period would you say uncle like it

546
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,880
was like they wouldn't touch it the

547
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,900
politicians didn't want anything to do

548
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,059
it and next thing you know we're doing

549
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,940
funder we're doing fundraisers you know

550
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:28,980
and shaking hands and wanting to take

551
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,679
showers afterwards you know sleeping

552
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,419
Sleeping with the Enemy right now that

553
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,519
being said I don't think Slovenian

554
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,220
politics are the same I think I think

555
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,839
Bojo I would ask you or or gosh did you

556
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,940
have something to say on that guess I

557
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,418
just wanted to add that

558
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,100
in contrary to U.S thinking especially

559
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,200
in Slovenia we also have to tackle

560
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:52,139
beside the politics aspect also the

561
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,019
public image of cannabis and we need to

562
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,240
work on improving that because I think

563
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,819
it's it's still a lot of people like

564
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,120
Western mentioned are still considered

565
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:05,099
cannabis like this bad illicit drug that

566
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,439
is being smoked on the corners you know

567
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:09,178
by by people they don't consider it that

568
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,580
it's actually

569
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,380
a medicine gonna use that word that it

570
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:16,439
helps a lot of people or a lot a lot of

571
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,419
really sick people and to improve the of

572
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,220
the image of cannabis to get a PR

573
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,080
representative for cannabis to to

574
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,900
improve the image in Slovenia and that I

575
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,579
think is the first step uh besides the

576
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,840
politic aspect yeah and I think that's

577
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:29,460
part of the political aspect because

578
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,839
that's like the politicians don't want

579
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,240
to touch it and the next thing you know

580
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,339
you're doing big fundraisers for

581
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,620
congressmen and senators and governors

582
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,658
and you're like it feels like a little

583
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,000
Allison a little bit Alice in Wonderland

584
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,440
but the cool thing is I've seen this

585
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,720
happen in three different jurisdictions

586
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,240
California Oregon and now what would be

587
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,100
done in in Germany

588
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,200
um by getting people together and and

589
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:54,839
forwarding the industry and I know that

590
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,960
that's happening in uh Slovenia now but

591
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:01,158
but Bozo what it so so you say there's

592
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,200
the obstacles within the the uh the

593
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:07,080
bureaucracy uh the long time

594
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,240
administrators is there what Ministry do

595
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,980
you think is what Ministry can help the

596
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,140
most what Ministries will be involved

597
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,819
when legalization does happen or

598
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,400
normalization and and what Ministry

599
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:20,639
could you name it is holding us back the

600
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,640
most right now uh yes the the most

601
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,600
problematic Ministry on on this part is

602
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:31,200
Minister of Health

603
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:34,079
uh but we are very unique because uh you

604
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,240
can grow cannabis for uh for food for

605
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,119
fiber and so on and I don't know why

606
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,240
they have jurisdiction

607
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:45,058
on the you know the the Cannabis why it

608
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,839
could be agricultural or of course I

609
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:52,019
don't even never uh understood why we

610
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:57,240
have any law about uh industrial hemp

611
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:59,278
and those things because uh hemp for

612
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,659
production of seed and fiber is is

613
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:06,659
excluded of a single one Convention of

614
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,900
61. so it's not part of it but still

615
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:11,880
bureaucrats of

616
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:16,740
somehow succeed to complicated

617
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:20,400
you know but I think that key is

618
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,679
now it's uh you know put together all

619
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,179
the industry and science but when I

620
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,778
started to

621
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:30,659
almost 20 years ago I already realized

622
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:33,240
that actually the education is the thing

623
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:36,080
where we have to move forward

624
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,480
so we started to

625
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,939
organized the

626
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,120
seminaries you know scientifical

627
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:48,120
conferences back in 2014.

628
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:50,879
uh but whenever we have anything to do

629
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,278
you know with medical chamber or

630
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,260
Ministry of Health

631
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:56,400
they do they have done everything to

632
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:00,839
stop us

633
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:03,960
you know on this or other ways so

634
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:06,058
but I still strongly believe in this if

635
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,058
we want to change narratives towards

636
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:10,918
cannabis we're still organizing

637
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:14,579
seminaries for doctors nurses

638
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:18,059
and I often joke that we have to educate

639
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:20,759
also journalists because you know most

640
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:22,619
of the journalists until now or when

641
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,319
they where they seek the information is

642
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:27,119
Ministry of Health National Institute of

643
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:31,500
Public Health

644
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:34,918
but there are people whom I would not

645
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,140
trust at all you know on their you know

646
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,840
that we in Slovenia where we have

647
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,559
already treat that because of cannabis

648
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:46,519
and it's uh generally known that nobody

649
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,960
died ever of cannabis but still National

650
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:53,579
Institute of Public Health that three

651
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,400
deaths and when you go you know it's it

652
00:28:53,579 --> 00:29:01,278
it's a bad light for a cannabis and

653
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,278
everything so again we have to

654
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,720
to

655
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,058
get rid of those bureaucrats who are

656
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,519
really there for 30 years and they stop

657
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:16,918
every move back in 2016 where Parliament

658
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:21,058
accepted the decision that they should

659
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,159
Ministry of Health prepare all legal uh

660
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:26,099
you know

661
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,039
basis to introduce cannabis to Medical

662
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,480
system today's

663
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:31,619
2023 so it's seven years and nothing

664
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,298
happened

665
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,439
Boston what do you think about that how

666
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:35,639
are we why don't you just tell us how

667
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,140
we're going to get it all done now

668
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,899
Boston

669
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,880
well one of my first meetings to the

670
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:44,519
ministry

671
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,600
I told them we need

672
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:51,898
let's say a state

673
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:55,459
electronic inboxes and I was told it can

674
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:58,619
be done and I said there's a

675
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,179
one-man band who did it 10 years ago in

676
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:02,099
the private sector how is it not

677
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,700
possible and the answer was look

678
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:09,298
Minister ministers change we stay

679
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,480
that was the answer so uh if I I

680
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:14,398
understand bonjour we should change the

681
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,659
bureaucrats but it's not possible we

682
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:20,479
should just be

683
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:24,360
that the policy should be strict should

684
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:28,319
I know put out the legislative proposal

685
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:31,379
and execute it that that's it so and the

686
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,960
same bureaucrats will do it but just you

687
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:37,020
have to give power to the people above

688
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,600
them so that they have the authority do

689
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:41,639
you have any hope that the bureaucrats

690
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,699
would would change that we could that

691
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,538
that's

692
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:51,058
the realism is deceiving palpable

693
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,740
um yeah well that's I that's good and so

694
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,898
if you can't beat them kind of join them

695
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,880
you got to coalesce is that kind of make

696
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:59,278
it make incentivize everyone to make

697
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,620
this a win-win for everyone yeah that's

698
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,538
that's real or just present them you

699
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,000
know with with everything sort of they

700
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:07,859
just need to sign off you know present

701
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,720
them with a I don't know a draft Bill

702
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:11,519
present them with the studies and

703
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,278
everything because I think a lot of them

704
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,579
are probably going to agree well just

705
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:21,538
lazy so don't don't have to do anything

706
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:23,220
and it's this has been so about this for

707
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:25,278
so long and so long and why change

708
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,200
something but the knives are coming out

709
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,140
I have to I have to emphasize they're

710
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,919
not lazy it's a bureaucratic state of

711
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:39,000
mind if I change something I take a risk

712
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:42,240
I take a risk I'm responsible because no

713
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,278
higher ranked public officer will take

714
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,140
responsibility for the lower one it's

715
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,798
not in our culture and that's the

716
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,820
problem so if they have strict rules

717
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:55,319
they follow it but imagine every time

718
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:59,038
you get to the administrative unit

719
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:02,759
there's a line a person goes

720
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,558
bio and gets in front of you are you

721
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:08,398
happy you know are you happy with the

722
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:11,220
bureaucrat who let him or her in no even

723
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,979
though they have a let's say a life

724
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,019
reason why that person should be in

725
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,519
front of you you don't accept it you

726
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,558
personally don't accept it because you

727
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,898
have rules and rules should be followed

728
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:25,558
and bureaucrats learned that they were

729
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:29,939
so often criticized for doing reasonable

730
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,980
things against some general rule they

731
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,899
just follow the general rules now and

732
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,480
it's something that we impose to the

733
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:39,599
bureaucrats and now we suffer from that

734
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,360
same consequence that's absolutely uh

735
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:46,139
fascinating and yeah gosh we're going

736
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:48,178
back to what you said about uh uh what

737
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,940
can we take from Germany I agree I think

738
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:54,059
the best model that we have right now to

739
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,360
push forward in Slovenia is the pilot

740
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:59,339
project model and uh I think the fact

741
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,898
that Slovenia has a rich history of

742
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:03,119
research and development with a lot of

743
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:05,759
things you guys are a very smart

744
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:08,519
Innovative country and I think that is

745
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,700
uh slovenia's biggest exit court right

746
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,519
now is research and development and

747
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,220
intellectual property and I'm just

748
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,380
really glad to be here on this ride with

749
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,880
all you guys you beautiful gentleman up

thanks guys so much

754
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,859
[Music]

755
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,538
I will open it up to questions right now

756
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:38,240
if anyone has any questions for our

757
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:38,240
esteem panel members uh please shoot

758
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:52,079
yes thank you very much it was indeed

759
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,860
very interesting but uh what were my

760
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,199
thoughts listening to why we still don't

761
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:00,898
have all these issues sorted out with

762
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,860
cannabis my question for you was then

763
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:07,678
okay but how do you evaluate the role of

764
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:08,940
pharmacies in this big picture are they

765
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,500
our allies

766
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,179
are they making it more difficult

767
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,940
because they see it's kind of a

768
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,179
competition with them if you grow our

769
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,918
own medicine in our backyards so what

770
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,019
are your thoughts on this

771
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,960
thank you

772
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:27,739
as far as I know no pharmacies have any

773
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,720
problem to reduce cannabis into their

774
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:33,479
you know but they just have to have

775
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:37,980
first chance it's strict rules

776
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:41,878
maybe Pharmacists and Pharmacy faculty

777
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:45,300
is even further than Medical Faculty

778
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:49,980
and they are more open than medical

779
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:52,619
sphere of of the same system actually so

780
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,139
I don't see any problems but we have so

781
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:59,460
confused

782
00:34:54,139 --> 00:35:03,300
legislation and you know uh

783
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:06,300
23 years yes since we adopted this Drug

784
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,019
law and still we don't have any how you

785
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,480
say Arctic

786
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:16,619
you know those

787
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:19,199
lower acts so it's 23 years actually the

788
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:21,980
law should not be functional if I know

789
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,078
well but they do it so

790
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:27,380
uh we have to bring orders as soon as

791
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:32,280
possible there are

792
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:35,160
uh some tries for years but you know to

793
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,700
change medical system it's not easy and

794
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:42,259
introducing the Cannabis into a medical

795
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:46,019
system is a big change for them and

796
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,240
I I would I would say that you have to

797
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,579
distinguish producers and sellers

798
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,219
producers can see you as a competition

799
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:55,740
sellers never they sell and if the

800
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:58,858
margin is higher the register sell your

801
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:01,679
product than the other people so and

802
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:04,259
regarding home grow uh I think we saw in

803
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,480
Canada when we had companies like tilray

804
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,880
who were lobbying against the home grow

805
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,338
because they thought it would deplete

806
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,380
their their revenue or people wouldn't

807
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:14,880
go to the dispensaries then we actually

808
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,200
find that that's the app that we

809
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,180
actually find that's the opposite though

810
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,699
that's not whether you however you feel

811
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:22,980
about home grow it just because someone

812
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:25,019
can grow a few plants in their house it

813
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,480
doesn't actually mean that dispensaries

814
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:29,579
in the area will will do less it has

815
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,099
means that they could actually do more

816
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:34,140
Revenue because the market is so primed

817
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:36,359
you know you can only grow one or two

818
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:38,338
strains but you go to the dispensary and

819
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,440
it's you know and where I'm from and

820
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:42,320
it's like a kid in a candy store and I'm

821
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,420
that kid and it's like

822
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,000
and it's like well I can't make shatter

823
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,800
or I can't you know I can't do that I

824
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,820
don't make dabs I can't make this pill

825
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,039
with perfectly five milligrams THC and

826
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:58,200
0.05 you know it just once the market

827
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,880
gets Advanced the home growth just

828
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,799
becomes a novelty it's like hey look at

829
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,960
my couple plants I I can save a little

830
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,640
bit of money you know or I could trade

831
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,800
it for something else whatever it is

832
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,299

billions of dollars we did Justin in

836
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,820
Oregon in Revenue uh this year so I just

837
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:19,618
like to make that point about homegrown

838
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,480

839
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,858

840

00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,099
um so it's eight eight uh 8 45 8 45 the

853
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:52,200

forget to tip your waiter and donate

855
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:56,039
what advice would you all give people so

856
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,680
people want to be politically involved

857
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:01,019
you know people want legalization in

858
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,879
Slovenia what all can they do they could

859
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:08,338
vote they can threaten I mean uh discuss

860
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,740
with their politicians what what else

861
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:12,719
what do you need big festivals or

862
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:14,939
rallies or protests like what is the

863
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,519
most effective way here in Slovenia

864
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,880
I believe that conference is like this

865
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,920
like giving knowledge to the people the

866
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,780
professionals and also the the general

867
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,838
public

868
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,240
um the the news gets out that people

869
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,820
know about it uh and I think step by

870
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,979
step this is gonna gonna get better uh

871
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,160
we don't have the processes in America

872
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:41,400
with the pressure on your representative

873
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,259
and so on uh so yeah just getting the

874
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,480
knowledge out to the people and that's

875
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,760
how it's only gonna get better

876
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,300
just

877
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,300
yes

878
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:58,500
I just wonder why you're saying a

879
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:02,519
homegirl for against a company in Israel

880
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:05,039
we have a only only company that is

881
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,139
providing a cannabis to the pharmacies

882
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,358
and this is only the way their patients

883
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:12,000
could buy the Cannabis but in Canada

884
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:15,000
they allowed to whole grow grown whole

885
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,519
but very few patients are really did it

886
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,300
a majority of the urban population has

887
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:23,280
is looking for a product already had

888
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,700
been made and available on the shelves

889
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,400
in these different strains in Israel we

890
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:32,779
are now trying to to convince our

891
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,940
partner that I'm a advisor of Israel

892
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:40,200
Israeli Committee of parliament for

893
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:43,380
cannabis regulation to permit to to have

894
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:46,980
a home grow with a good quality will be

895
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,140
assessed and and the company could could

896
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,838
Supply cannabis for the patients

897
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:54,059
together business Pharmacy so Pharmacy

898
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,799
should not concurrent with a company who

899
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,139
should be a supplier because before

900
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,420
reform we had only companies apply

901
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:02,279
directly to the patients and now they

902
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,320
could bring it to the only to the

903
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,420
pharmacy Pharmacy has a margin about 30

904
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,400
percent this is a large amount of money

905
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,220
coming to the pharmacies and the

906
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,460
patients have a very

907
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:16,919
huge difficulty so the the we do not

908
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,559
have a optimal system of regulation in

909
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,960
the world there is no optimal system but

910
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:27,000
I I but we need to have a a computation

911
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,338
corporate system that permits people to

912
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,800
buy it from the supplier from the grower

913
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:34,320
and from the pharmacy by their own chase

914
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,579
this is a human rights thank you yeah so

915
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,380
that wasn't a question that was a

916
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:39,359
statement but it was something that I

917
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,820
basically thought I kind of already said

918
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,098
when I talk about this home girl I

919
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,800
believe it's a human right also to have

920
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:49,140
to grow cannabis to grow any plant to

921
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,420
grow mushrooms if you have if you really

922
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:53,819
will okay I don't I think whatever God

923
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,460
gave us to grow in our backyards we

924
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,619
should be able uh to grow but one step

925
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,720
at a time my lawyer's freaking out right

926
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,200
now he's like no no don't say Mushrooms

927
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,358
but uh uh these are all healing plants

928
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:08,279
we have to give back to a spiritual our

929
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:09,960
spiritual intelligence a lot of people

930
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,880
don't talk about what spiritual

931
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,099
intelligence is we know about academic

932
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,720
intelligence social intelligence but we

933
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,820
really have to get back to a spiritual

934
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,039
intelligence where we have just more

935
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,559
feeling and empathy in community in

936
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,460
general and come from the bottom up and

937
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,469
not the top downs and if I just want to

938
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,740
I want to talk

939
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:34,379
[Music]

940
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:38,699
I just want to add to Ilya I just don't

941
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:41,640
want to mix the medical sector and

942
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:44,659
public health sector and personal use

943
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:49,500
and human rights

944
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:51,659
I always say if on any field it is you

945
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,820
know now very popular my body my choice

946
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:56,338
so it should be also on the field of

947
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,760
cannabis yeah I agree that we also had

948
00:41:56,338 --> 00:42:02,039
in our session on science so to divide

949
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,040
to have different laws for recreational

950
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,900
and for medical and uh I would just like

951
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,838
to add to uh

952
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,079
of what shall we do in Slovenia now I

953
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,838
think that uh as we heard at the opening

954
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:19,500
our president of the government and our

955
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:21,719
Coalition now is willing uh ready to do

956
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:26,820
something about it and it's a moment

957
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:28,739
that also all we just try to go directly

958
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:33,000
to the government to the representative

959
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:35,879
of the government and demand that and

960
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,380
what to also organize such a meetings

961
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:43,019
with within Slovenia within our

962
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:46,440
politicians like you know let's say the

963
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:49,259
city the city government the the mayor

964
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,539
of Ljubljana and so on and to to move

965
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,820
this idea forward and what the

966
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:57,000
politicians wants in the Civil Society

967
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:59,579
and here we have for example the

968
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,579
association of oncological patients in

969
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:05,400
their the director here so we have also

970
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,500
uh Europa Donna so the patience of

971
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,800
breast with breast cancer and they

972
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:14,219
should push along with us to the idea

973
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,099
and carried out to politicians so to

974
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:20,159
