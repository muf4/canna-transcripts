5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,320
we're going to be talking about research

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,198
advancements and some of the emerging

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,839

brain and how H the therapeutic

24
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:05,879
potential of cannabis can actually work

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,599
on humans so um through my work in the

26
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:12,280
Academia and the work on the industry uh

54
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,680
laboratory analytical land process

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,319
instrumentation for uh initially for

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,000
many years for over 30 years on the

57
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:39,439
pharmaceutical industry and with the uh

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,158
starting legalization of medical Canabis

59
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,800
production and processing in Portugal in

60
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:50,120
2018 we were brought to this uh to this

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:54,560
uh to this field extraction it has been

62
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,879
always uh one of our main topics in our

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,360
business either Manufacturing Systems

64
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:03,759
either Distributing more

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,159
higher capacity systems too

66
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:10,280
uh but over these years by request of

67
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:13,120
our customers somehow we expanded also

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,598
for the Post Harvest so bucking trimming

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,480
and so on so we can say that from the

70
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,719
moment you cut you harvest your plant uh

71
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,119
we have been

72
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,359
present one of our big concerns it has

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,759
always been because in Europe until now

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,560
it has been medical Canabis so we have

75
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:35,039
to follow EU GMP guidelines to make sure

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,799
that Solutions were compliant with these

77
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,039
guidelines and also to optimize the

78
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,400
processes most especially on extraction

79
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,679
and on

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,480
purification where we see that the

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:53,560
knowledge uh that uh there is four

82
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:55,119
Canabis doesn't allow yet to take this

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,000
processes many of processes on

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,200
extraction purification to the most

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,598
efficient level to the most uh efficient

86
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:08,438
and also according to the guidelines

87
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,679
consistent products with purities

88
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:15,078
and basically to assure that the product

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,560
is a safe product for uh the consumers

90
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,319
and the medical Canabis very cool

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,399
Justin all right good to see everybody

92
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:27,800
here my name is Justin tombi I am uh

93
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,679
here on behalf of the tomman group um as

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,439
we sort of lead efforts to up upgrade

95
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,000
research and development activities here

96
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,918
in the Cannabis industry both in Europe

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and globally to more Professional

98
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,519
Standards uh I'm from Oregon originally

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,160
um my background is cannabis I grew up

100
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,399
in the culture I've been involved in

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,600
sort of every stage of the industry's

102
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,079
development from premedical to Medical

103
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:58,560
to recreational to hemp at scale um I

104
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:01,560
helped found and uh lead a uh hemp

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,120
breeding company by the name of fonics

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,918
where we did genomic cross indexing of

107
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,879
phenotypes and genotypes to different

108
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,719
cannabinoid profiles and then different

109
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,279
cultivation methodologies and produce

110
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,520
lines and varieties um of hemp for

111
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,879
different

112
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:21,839
application um I've also uh had a

113
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,360
background at one point in a a R&amp;D Tech

114
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,279
incubator for non-thermal plasma

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,280
technology so I know the value of good

116
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,959
uh R&amp;D good data management and good

117
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:35,079
practice and methodology a lot of which

118
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:38,000
has been missing in cannabis research

119
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,879
over the years because of various biases

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,800
and and lack of basic supporting context

121
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,918
and information uh so our goal here is

122
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,639
to kind of elevate the conversation

123
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,799
about what uh makes good research in the

124
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,519
Cannabis space and how we can get there

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,639
and I'm looking forward to this

126
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,439
conversation awesome and then my friend

127
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,639
from

128
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:04,160
Slovenia uh hello everybody I'm badish

129
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm coming from Slovenia I am a founder

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,039
and uh project manager of research

131
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,199
nature in

132
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:15,240
Institute uh we are actually supporting

133
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,520
uh Slovenian and international patients

134
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,598
with the quality control of their

135
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:24,318
products now for last N9 years I

136
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:27,120
think uh and uh later on this was the

137
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:32,039
first part uh we also starting to

138
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:36,038
organize uh education for uh doctors and

139
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:39,399
nurses uh because uh we realize that uh

140
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:41,560
if doctors are not educated cannabis

141
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,598
will never be a part of the medical

142
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,240
system so I think it's the most

143
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:50,319
important uh issue and I hope that

144
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,519
industry will uh you know accept that

145
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,960
and maybe

146
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,598
support uh more research like the Pharma

147
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,038
industry do uh but cannabis is very

148
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:04,519
special and

149
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:07,639
uh field so I hope that industry will uh

150
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,198
see that it's really necessary other

151
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:13,079
things that we are

152
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,720
doing uh because I was also in jail

153
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:19,038
because of cannabis we started to make

154
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,840
this legalization or regulation process

155
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:26,159
in Slovenia which in last uh 2 three

156
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:28,519
years also with help of the tman group

157
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,360
made the big leaps in Slovenia and I

158
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:35,839
hope uh that uh we will be the next

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,319
country following uh Germany soon all

160

one in Berlin hopefully we'll see you

169
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,079
there and excited to be talking with

170
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,079
these great panelists about research and

171
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,680
the first thing we want to talk about is

172
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,918
why is the research so important I mean

173
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,478
we touched on it a little bit and maybe

174
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,680
we'll start with you since you kind of

175
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:09,478
touched on it you know why is research

176
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,000
so important why why do we need to even

177
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,918
be doing this

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,879
uh of course the research is most

179
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:20,918
important that uh the professionals get

180
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,800
enough usable data to bring the Cannabis

181
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,799
into mainstream medicine uh actually

182
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,280
cannabis is the most research plant on

183
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,038
the planet with over 150,000 published

184
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,000
uh

185
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:37,360
studies uh but still uh the the doctors

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,399
or the professionals they don't have any

187
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,000
uh protocols they don't have actually

188
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,000
any any uh base to prescribe cannabis at

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,120
least in

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,080
Slovenia uh cannabis in last 70 years

191
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,278
was mentioned just in a bad connotation

192
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,120
not as a medicine and I think this 70-

193
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:01,320
year old propaganda uh still ongoing uh

194
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,879
made the big damage and this is what we

195
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,200
want to turn

196
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,480
over other thoughts why why else is

197
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,720
research so important any other thoughts

198
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,399
uh um so I think research uh is always

199
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,800
important in that it generates um

200
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,399
knowledge and data that can be used um

201
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,199
in practical application but it's

202
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,839
dependent on the methodology of the

203
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,800
research right so uh you can conduct

204
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,519
studies with sort of narrow scope and um

205
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,879
kind of preset biases about what your

206
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,519
outcomes are likely to be or you can

207
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,159
also conduct research without necessary

208
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,039
context and those are going to um

209
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:45,919
predispose your results um

210
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:47,679
to uh to limited application so one of

211
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,000
the things that's happening now is is

212
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:56,399
we're looking at sort of a wider range

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,958
of how we can um Carry research out uh

214
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
that uh certainly wasn't allowed before

215
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,359
in

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,799
and I think that um the the outcome of

217
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,320
having more data available is that then

218
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,278
there's more spec specificity and more

219
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,399
Effectiveness in application and whether

220
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:18,879
that's medical right and whether we're

221
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,559
talking about the use of um uh

222
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,120
cannaboids as agones for CBN one and two

223
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,799
receptors that uh reduce cell

224
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,480
proliferation and tumor formation for

225
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,799
glioblastoma right that's very specific

226
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,240
but then which cannabinoids and which

227
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,240
ratios um in which clinical settings are

228
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,039
going to be most effective well okay

229
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,039
have we addressed that or if we're

230
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:44,439
talking about the use of uh you know

231
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,958
cannabis fibers in electroforesis for

232
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,760
substrates for super capacitors and

233
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:55,599
energy storage um these are really

234
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:57,159
different but the um the the level of um

235
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,639
background contextual information the

236
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,000
openness to different outcomes and the

237
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,039
methodology

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,240
used um will definitely influence what

239
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,879
the the result is and that's what we

240
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,680
really want is we want good results to

241
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,078
guide good decisionmaking so we have to

242
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,319
have high quality research to do that

243
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,919
yeah that's a good point and we were

244
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,399
backstage we were talking about the

245
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,919
importance around education uh we hear

246
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,360
doctors all the time saying oh there's

247
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,439
not enough research and we don't know

248
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,639
enough research well you know how do

249
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,480
they get this research because there is

250
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,600
a lot of research out there but

251
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,278
sometimes they don't really make too

252
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,680
much of an effort to go out of their way

253
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:31,679
and maybe it's cuz the Pharma companies

254
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,159
are are so in their faith with all their

255
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,958
research you know what can we do better

256
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,360
to make sure that the doctors are are

257
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,559
learning about this research because

258
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,039
it's so important Alberto or ruie want

259
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:44,958
to touch on that well first point is we

260
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,799
have to research because research gives

261
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,719
you knowledge but it's also the way you

262
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:53,919
do this research uh if we want doctors

263
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,800
to start prescribing Canabis we have to

264
00:11:53,919 --> 00:12:00,199
do research with the statistical

265
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,958
relevance I'm not saying that ideally

266
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,720
this would be like far away you know

267
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,278
with clinical studies and so on but this

268
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,200
takes many years and tens hundreds of

269
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:12,799
millions but the studies have to have uh

270
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,399
statistical relevance then with this

271
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,559
data is absolutely necessary as to start

272
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,320
educating the

273
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,838
doctors uh and there is I think not one

274
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,360
magical solution for everything

275
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,000
different countries have different

276
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,800
realities maybe even legal requirements

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but but it's absolutely necessary to

278
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,000
create I

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,440
think uh courses is not just making like

280
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,919
a congress I I talking about Portugal

281
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,040
where I come there is one or two

282
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:46,559
meetings per year about medical cannabis

283
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,480
in which doctors are invited but after

284
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:53,359
these two meetings doctors go home and

285
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,920
they forget either if there isn't a

286
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,240
specialization few weeks ideally some

287
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,838
months specialization training that

288
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,919
doctors can

289
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,800
attend there will never be doctors that

290
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,719
will be really willing or a big number

291
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,838
of doctors that is really willing to

292
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,440
start describing Canabis this is a main

293
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:19,079
issue we need specialization courses on

294
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Canabis how long it will depend but it's

295
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:25,159
not with meetings congresses you need

296
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:28,399
this TR this uh this

297
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:30,039
discourses now depending and again with

298
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,679
the with Portuguese

299
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,879
reality we should strive to have the

300
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,359
doctor's Association

301
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:42,600
blessing uh because without this doctor

302
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,519
assession blessing there will be Yeah by

303
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,159
just by happening there will be a

304
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,000
doctors start

305
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,958
describing being

306
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,440
evangelized understanding the benefits

307
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:55,958
of the medical Canabis but to have a

308
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,440
major major impact then it comes with

309
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:01,239
lobing also it depends what is take over

310
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,680
maybe sometimes it's government in

311
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,360
Portugal is not so much the government

312
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,559
but exactly this Medical Association

313
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,278
that they have to give the blessing to

314
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:15,278
these courses so that then the doctors

315
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,639
wi without fear of any lawsuit or

316
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,679
liability that they can start

317
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,519
prescribing Canabis no fear that's a

318
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,399
good point Alberto what do you think

319
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,639
yeah to me it's quite clear that we need

320
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,000
uh research to understand exactly how

321
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,959
cannabis affects the body and and the

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,679
therapeutic potential of of this plant

323
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,439
we need to know exactly if these

324
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,000
treatments are safe and we also need to

325
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,480
investigate the efficacy of these

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,600
treatments and obviously we need to

327
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:50,079
train the doctors so they can understand

328
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,839
when they can prescribe this but the

329
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,799
evidence that we are creating at the

330
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,160
moment is only clinical evidence and

331
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:59,319
clinical evidence cost a lot of money

332
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:03,240
and a clinical trial cost millions of of

333
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,839
euros and not everybody is able to spend

334
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,839
that money to create that evidence that

335
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,680
doctors may need uh in the other hand we

336
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,639
also have what is called the real world

337
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,000
evidence that these types of studies are

338
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,000
observational studies that can still be

339
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,799
run by doctors so we can train the

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,480
doctors to collect the feedback data

341
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:27,399
from the patients and use that data to

342
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,440
create that evidence to understand how

343
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:35,000
cannabis can really help to certain

344
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,360
medical conditions and that knowledge

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,519
will come back to the doctors to

346
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,759
understand how it works so we not we

347
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:48,000
don't only need to uh train the doctors

348
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,919
on how they can uh use cannabis for the

349
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,600
patients but we also have to train them

350
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:57,479
to collect data so we can um make the

351
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,959
evidence larger we can we can create

352
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,519
more evidence so we know exactly how

353
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,958
gabis works great Point Justin yeah I

354
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,318
just wanted to add real quickly to what

355
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:09,559
Alberto was saying a real world example

356
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:12,599
um John Hopkins University is launching

357
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:16,000
um in this year a study of a large

358
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,040
cohort of 10,000 uh patients who are

359
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,799
engaging uh uh what they call um from a

360
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,399
cannabis naive position so their first

361
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,879
time to begin using uh cannabis

362
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,120
medically um and they're they're working

363
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,759
with a nonprofit out of Colorado called

364
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,278
The Realm for caring ing uh they got a

365
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,639
$10 million Grant from the federal

366
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,198
government and they're tracking the um

367
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,759
uh variety of different health

368
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:41,278
indicators and metrics um over minimum

369
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,720
of the first year frequent uh check-ins

370
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,679
to begin with later afterwards they're

371
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,000
looking at uh they're looking at dosage

372
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,399
they're looking at cannaboid ratios

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,198
they're looking across these wide range

374
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,639
of um again health indicators to create

375
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,120
kind of a database um about a bunch of

376
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,839
different therapeutic uses and then that

377
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,519
would be an aggregate form of data that

378
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,600
back to Alberto's Point could be

379
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:09,480
utilized um to um better inform and

380
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,159
train doctors about um how cannabis use

381
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,000
and all these different contexts affects

382
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,279
you know interactions with other drugs

383
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,078
different Health outcomes things like

384
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,678
that so having the um the research and

385
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,838
the data on one side and then having

386
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,959
that accessible to the healthc Care

387
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,038
Professionals it's really important

388
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,440
agreed have a thought I just want to add

389
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:32,119
something you know uh until the kind and

390
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,679
endocr system will not be the part of

391
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,879
curriculum in the schools and

392
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,880
universities we have done nothing we are

393
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,320
just throwing a little bit of water into

394
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,480
big fire and uh there will be no success

395
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,918
you know that's the point and if we

396
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,400
start to educate those people today it

397
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,640
will be available in 10 years when we

398
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,559
have first generation of you know

399
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,200
informed uh

400
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:03,399
Physicians mhm that's excellent point

401
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,038
Thank you applaud that for sure um just

402
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,000
wanted to touch on uh therapeutic

403
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,839
benefits of these canabo you know in

404
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,599
Canada we have a lot of uh CBG CBN

405
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,319
products that get in a lot of talk and

406
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,240
uh I hate when people say it's a new

407
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,720
canabo they're not new canabo these

408
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,519
canabo have been there the whole time we

409
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,519
just never really knew anything about

410
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,000
them but uh it's creating a lot of

411
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,038
excitement like my my mom is taking CBN

412
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,480
gummy and I was joking with you that she

413
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,519
used to yell at me that cannabis is

414
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,519
ruining my life and now she's taking it

415
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,879
and she's telling her friends about it

416
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,279
uh we're starting to see a lot of these

417
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,559
cool new therapeutic uh canabo Without

418
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,839
Really any of the research and I wanted

419
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,759
to see from the the panelist what other

420
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,678
exciting things are you seeing on the

421
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,839
research side that you're excited about

422
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,000
on the therapeutic advancements uh

423
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,798
anything You' like to talk about

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,359
anything specific that you're excited

425
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:54,119
about uh with that you want to start

426
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,479
yeah from my side well I'm I'm really

427
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,119
looking forward for the data of what I

428
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,679
was talking before of the real world

429
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:05,000
evidence uh like the job

430
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:07,480
Hopkins study that is been done and also

431
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,319
and there is a program in the UK that is

432
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,038
called 2021 that they also collecting a

433
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,960
lot of feedback from patients I think

434
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:18,359
that's what's going to change everything

435
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,200
once we know exactly what works and for

436
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,319
what and for which medical conditions

437
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,200
from the real experience of the patients

438
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:28,319
I'm really looking forward for that and

439
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,080
in the other hand uh well one of the

440
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,519
studies that I'm going to start soon is

441
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,879
also the psycho pharmacology of minor

442
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:39,400
cannabinoids to see how

443
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:43,440
cbdb can affect the the the brain H CBC

444
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,360
CBN CBG but from from a clinical

445
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,279
perspective it would be kind of a

446
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,279
clinical trial to see the

447
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,038
psychopharmacology of minor cannabinoids

448
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,399
so it's something that I'm also looking

449
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:57,480
forward for that and in general what I

450
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,240
want to see is more research on minor

451
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,919
cannabinoids and well done research

452
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,798
because what uh there's not enough funds

453
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,919
to do all these things we I think it

454
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,839
would be also interesting to get H

455
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
public funds to do these things because

456
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,759
otherwise the only ones that could do

457
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,120
this research would be the

458
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,000
pharmaceutical industry and the

459
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,678
pharmaceutical industry I think it plays

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,359
a role here and it can be important

461
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,919
because obviously they they they put in

462
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,279
resources to do research but we have to

463
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,919
find also other ways to do research that

464
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,759
can benefit to also smaller companies

465
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,440
and obviously the

466
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:41,400
Academia cool

467
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,480
that's this is not much my area but some

468
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,679
the things I'm going and seeing and

469
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,798
reading it was very interesting seeing

470
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,798
some uh studies recent researchers in um

471
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:54,759
autism treatment with

472
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:57,440
cbdv and diabetes even although it's not

473
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:00,319
a critical disease so much as the others

474
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,558
with jcv but we are talking here about

475
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,558
the research for the patients but and

476
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:08,200
you're talking about minor

477
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:10,278
cannabinoids and by minor then when it

478
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,679
comes to get them available let's say

479
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:15,480
ntracts becomes really expensive and

480
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,880
complicated to get this and so

481
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,759
increasing the price of these

482
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,360
cannabinoids and there has been lots of

483
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:26,759
research and nowadays is not even uh so

484
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:29,319
uncommon to find flowers buds with

485
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:32,119
plants producing High contents thcv so

486
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:35,278
thcv for instance is not anymore a minor

487
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:37,759
for those strains this is other research

488
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,919
happening that at the end will be very

489
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:43,240
relevant then for the application of

490
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,159
these cannabinoids for the Therapeutics

491
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,278
that doctors and researchers like

492
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,720
Alberto are are finding for these

493
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:52,159
cannabinoids yeah for sure and uh you

494
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,919
know we're seeing you want add anything

495
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,520
to that

496
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,600
uh uh in terms of therapeutic

497
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,319
applications yeah I'll just put a brief

498
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,439
plug in for something that's um a huge

499
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,079
problem for us in the US uh due to some

500
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,960
irresponsibility on the pharmaceutical

501
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,599
Industries part and um the

502
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,519
ineffectiveness of regulators we have a

503
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:18,439
huge opioid dependency issue um in the

504
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:20,240
US and um the impact um is significant

505
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,159
can't be understated there has been

506
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,558
research done uh showing the benefits of

507
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:30,039
cannabis use for um adjunct treatments

508
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:32,759
um for opioid dependency and in uh show

509
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,759
Market significantly uh statistically

510
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,079
significant increases in efficacy of

511
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:42,400
treatment north of 20% increase in the

512
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:44,639
Cannabis user cohort as well as um uh

513
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,960
decreased rates of recidivism so that's

514
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,600
an area I'd like to just highlight say

515
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,880
it's a powerful way that cannabis can

516
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,639
help and something I'd like to see more

517
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,360
research in for sure uh you know in the

518
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,120
Cannabis case I think the Pharma

519
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,879
industry and Main

520
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:03,158
mainstream uh research industry let's

521
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,840
put it that way they actually don't know

522
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:09,960
how to do it you know because they are

523
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:13,720
mostly you looking for molecules for

524
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,880
certain condition or disease but with

525
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,679
cannabis is other way around you have to

526
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,919
adjust to your endoc canab system and so

527
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:28,720
on so I think this is also the reason

528
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:32,559
why uh you know now you uh uh year

529
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,600
before uh was thcv now is CBN then is

530
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:38,119
CBG all those minor cannaboids but we

531
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:41,519
never look into the whole picture and

532
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:44,199
how the Cannabis effect to end the canab

533
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,720
system actually and when we figure this

534
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,159
out it will be way easier yeah no

535
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,839
excellent point and uh you know

536
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,640
something we were also talking back

537
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,839
stage is around the importance around

538
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,640
quality and Innovation and Technology uh

539
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,599
your research is only as good as the

540
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,480
quality of what you're researching I

541
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,678
mean there was an example in Canada

542
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,240
where someone was doing some research

543
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,559
and they found that the Cannabis wasn't

544
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,798
effective like people were not getting

545
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,119
good results and I said wait where are

546
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:09,158
you getting the Cannabis from and I

547
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,719
won't mention the company name but the

548
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,080
company product is terrible and then

549
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,319
it's like of course they're not getting

550
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,798
good results they're getting like hey

551
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,399
you know this isn't cannabis so uh we

552
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:21,200
were talking backstage about some of the

553
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,159
Innovations whether in plant production

554
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,159
or whether in extraction uh in re

555
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,278
research methodologies maybe we can just

556
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,520
talk about something and then we're

557
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,440
going to open it up to questions if

558
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:32,599
anyone has any questions uh get ready

559
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,038
for them uh but talk about some

560
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:36,359
breakthroughs you're seeing in in your

561
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:38,759
own perspective areas uh that you are

562
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,319
excited about that can actually help the

563
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,519
research side because without the

564
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,879
product quality it doesn't matter the

565
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,158
research that's being done so who who

566
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,960
wants to start us off maybe Justin with

567
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,399
the plants like you know what's some of

568
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,399
the research being done on the plants so

569
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:54,599
that the research on the patients is

570
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:57,839
benefited yeah well it all starts with

571
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,359
the plants right um so obviously from my

572
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,798
background we um we start looking at you

573
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:05,000
know genotypes and and then uh

574
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,359
cultivating specific varieties that can

575
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,398
predispose plants to producing more or

576
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,719
less of certain cannabinoids right so if

577
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:14,879
we want to emphasize tcva as one of the

578
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,759
minors and the production of that we

579
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,440
start looking at it genetically but it's

580
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,879
not just um a genetic expression right

581
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,120
um we have also all of the environmental

582
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,278
or abiotic epigenetic influences that

583
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:32,839
change um how the plant create secondary

584
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:36,038
metabolites so um that means that you

585
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:38,678
can change the light uh the color

586
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:41,919
frequency intensity of the light and

587
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,600
that changes the um relative ratios of

588
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,399
different kinds of canono um that are

589
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:50,519
produced so UVB light tends to drive um

590
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:53,000
THC and CBD production there's been

591
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,879
research that illustrates that whereas

592
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,440
certain kinds of LED lighting um with a

593
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,600
more full uh spectrum and lower

594
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,759
intensity has been shown to get the

595
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,839
ratio of

596
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:09,000
CBG uh to THD production down closer to

597
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,678
1:2 um as opposed to 1 to 16 so that's

598
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,440
an example of where you use something

599
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,679
like light spectrum to to impact what

600
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,320
the plant's producing which will then um

601
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:24,798
relate to a feed stock product um for

602
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:26,558
the um ultimately the patient um I also

603
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,440
think in terms of it's important to say

604
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,119
on the whole value chain beginning from

605
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,399
plant all the way up um if you want good

606
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,719
medicine for people um you have to treat

607
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:38,000
the whole process with respect you can't

608
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,319
just be profit um driven in this you

609
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,480
can't look at the lowest cost inputs and

610
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,720
have no mindfulness about what chemicals

611
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,599
you are using in the soil the plants or

612
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,558
the extraction processes which solvents

613
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,839
might be left behind you really have to

614
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,678
come at this from respecting ultimately

615
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,678
the the value of the life of the

616
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,120
ecosystem the plant itself and then the

617
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,759
the patient that's ultimately going to

618
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:02,319
use that um so we always ask advocate

619
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:05,038
for highest standards of uh of practice

620
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,079
in cultivation Organics biodynamics

621
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,640
regenerative and you can kind of Follow

622
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,918
that up and that might be a place where

623
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:16,440
it's good for me to pass this over to

624
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,240
ruie because I believe um you know he he

625
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,240
and I have had conversations speaking to

626
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,640
the the importance of upholding those

627
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,798
same kind of Standards when it comes to

628
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,278
extraction and processing yeah that's

629
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:28,839
very important for sure R some thoughts

630
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:32,240
one of the main issues with extraction

631
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,359
is that if you start to eat a bad flour

632
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,440
low potency flour you always get also

633
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,519
extracts that are not very poent and

634
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,600
with more

635
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:45,319
impurities uh if you want high quality

636
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:47,959
extracts without going in over steps

637
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:50,200
many steps of purification in which you

638
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,558
will end up also losing compounds that

639
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,840
are of interest you would have to work

640
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,319
always with high potency high quality

641
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:00,319
flour nowadays based on CO2 extraction

642
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,158
but in different conditions of standard

643
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,720
super critical conditions you are able

644
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:09,120
independently of the potency of flower

645
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,440
it can be 5% potency can be 25% potency

646
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,158
you will always get extracts let's say a

647
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,640
full spectrum oil as first extract with

648
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,559
potency is always over 80 to 85 so these

649
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,559
are methodos in which conditions of

650
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,200
solvent is very very selective to

651
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:28,599
cannabinoids this is why you always get

652
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,159
the hypothesis even starting with plants

653
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,798
with low pocy this is quite important

654
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,840
because at the same time using these

655
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:37,000
Technologies you can also maintain high

656
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,398
levels of

657
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,200
trines people always speak about full

658
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:44,079
spectrum oil but what's a full spectrum

659
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,240
oil a full spectrum oil is an oil on an

660
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,960
extract in which the chemistry of the

661
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,200
extract is very similar to the chemistry

662
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,319
of the flow so uh the ratios of

663
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,519
cannabinoids are the same on extra Clan

664
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,720
flour the ratios of tpin are the same in

665
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,159
the extra in flow and the ratio between

666
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,278
total canab noise and total tpin are the

667
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:09,080
same if many extraction techniques will

668
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,640
not keep this ratio so saying that you

669
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,038
have an full spectrum oil many times

670
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,640
it's just marketing is not a true full

671
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,839
spectrum oil this kind of new

672
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,080
technologies you get real full spectrum

673
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,720
oils it also makes life easier when you

674
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,879
move them to distillates or even to

675
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,000
isolate because in these techniques you

676
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,200
can opt to take the tpin or % of the P

677
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,759
Sal making life of in terms of

678
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,600
purification and reification of the

679
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,440
extract quite easier yeah this is a big

680
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,240
impact that's a good point and you know

681
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,960
we like to joke that garbage in garbage

682
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,880
out they expect to just take some

683
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,360
garbage product throw it in there and

684
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,519
Magic is going to come out well if it

685
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,558
was garbage before it's not there's no

686
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,079
magic formula that takes some garbage

687
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,918
old stale cannabis and turns it into to

688
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,398
fire as we we like to joke about it so

689
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,038
that's a good point there is even also

690
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,479
coming not to extraction but for

691
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,879
production there are also developments

692
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,798
this applies more for indoor facilities

693
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,120
indoor facilities usually uh is seen

694
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:11,918
that a way to produce Canabis with less

695
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:15,959
contamination microbiological bioburden

696
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,519
uh bioburden issues less uh microbes

697
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,798
less bacteria less mold nevertheless

698
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,919
even indoor things can go wrong and

699
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:26,720
typically as this facilities age you end

700
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,200
up having an increased number of

701
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,558
contaminations there are also so

702
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,360
nowadays new technologies that allow you

703
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:39,038
to so by working Contin continuously

704
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:41,599
24hour 7 to kill eliminate 98% of

705
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,359
pathogens and it's in the air in surface

706
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:47,038
wall ceilings but most especially on

707
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,639
surface of your flower so these will

708
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,038
have you end up with a flower that is

709
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,200
far less

710
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:56,519
contaminated will not require treatments

711
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,278
like irradiation that always affect

712
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:02,000
quality of flour

713
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,480
dries it up kills the Tes we seen it any

714
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,599
last thoughts Justin before we open up

715
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,319
for questions just wanted to tag really

716
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,879
quickly on the whole meta picture of um

717
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,480
indoor cultivation uh versus greenhouse

718
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,080
and outdoor as there is this sort of

719
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,440
view Paradigm that in order to quality

720
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:21,720
control and increase um uh Purity and

721
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,679
security there's a drive to put things

722
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,919
in indoor conditions for cultivation um

723
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,120
and it's a it's a question worth really

724
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,960
evaluating in the long term whether this

725
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,518
makes sense I pose this for everybody to

726
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,038
consider and take home with them um the

727
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:39,159
energy intensity and cultivation the if

728
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,278
we're talking about things in terms of a

729
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,840
a CO2 footprint or an energy consumption

730
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,919
or environmental impact of indoor

731
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,119
systems and cultivation needs to really

732
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,679
be looked at and in terms of what we

733
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:53,239
look at for um Purity and uh whether

734
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,399
there are biological contaminants

735
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,200
microbial contaminants part of that is a

736
00:31:55,398 --> 00:32:01,398
misunderstanding the thought that um all

737
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,360
microbes need to be controlled is is a

738
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:06,879
misunderstanding pathogens uh occur in

739
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:09,158
the absence of beneficial microorganisms

740
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,480
and really understanding how to

741
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:16,039
cultivate uh uh beneficial strong

742
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,839
healthy robust uh micro uh ecosystems in

743
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:21,240
the soil and on the plant then actually

744
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,079
as a cultivator you can eliminate a lot

745
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,599
of the potential for pathogens the same

746
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,720
thing in your processing uh uh practices

747
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,719
for curing and all that so I want to

748
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,558
just push back a little bit against the

749
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,319
assumption that you need to create

750
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:40,038
laboratory like aseptic conditions to

751
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:42,439
grow and process your uh cannabis in

752
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,119
order to have a high quality High Purity

753
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,120
healthy product um and I think in the

754
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,479
larger context we need to examine those

755
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,558
assumptions um that's that's a good

756
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,759
point and uh you know I think I think

757
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:54,918
along that lines it's around the

758
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:56,879
consistency we want to have consistency

759
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,720
so it's always the same I mean when we

760
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,240
make our edibles people think of Edibles

761
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,360
as Recreational Products but really

762
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,038
they're an excellent meter dose way of

763
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,359
using cannabinoids you know smoking a

764
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:07,558
joint and then doing research is a very

765
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,918
difficult thing because it's always so

766
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,079
different but having some meter dose and

767
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,600
also I work with a company called

768
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:14,558
zentella which we were talking about

769
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,079
before where they have an EEG headband

770
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,519
that measures brain waves and tells you

771
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,439
when did you get high how high did you

772
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,159
get and for how long these are the types

773
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,840
of things that are going to

774
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,840
revolutionize uh that so uh just want to

775
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:27,158
open it up to some uh quite first round

776
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,158
of applause for our panelists very very

777
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:34,159
insightful I see question back over

778
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,639
there s got five minutes for

779
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,200
questions hey guys thank you so much for

780
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:39,759
sharing your knowledge I could geek out

781
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,120
with you guys for a while I'm maxico

782
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,359
yeah we could for sure CEO at abstracts

783
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,959
Justin you uh did a great job mentioning

784
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,759
narrow broad scopes with John Hopkins

785
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,278
and although this one's going wider I I

786
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,599
appreciate them also having a narrow

787
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,599
focus with that study ruy I believe you

788
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:58,319
mentioned some of our research possibly

789
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,038
on uh with Western Washington on um the

790
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,480
uh study is done with Tarpin and autism

791
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,519
and Alberta I totally agree with you

792
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,480
that minor canabo need not only more

793
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,239
research behaviorally but also

794
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,480
toxicology um with abstracts we've

795
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,598
invested significant resources into

796
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,519
researching cannabis Aroma compounds

797
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,559
putting out a lot of Publications on the

798
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,679
science of exotic THS Esters flavorant

799
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,838
everything that affects the Cannabis

800
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,960
experience and so there's a lot of talk

801
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,960
here about cannaboids and how they

802
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,559
affect experience but as Ry you

803
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,320
mentioned our resar SE arch with Western

804
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,239
Washington these play a bigger part in

805
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,879
here I would argue some of these more

806
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,000
smaller volatile compounds we're

807
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,078
discovering have a broader impact in the

808
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,239
experience and so what can we do

809
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,399
together to help Foster more research we

810
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,078
got a great re we got a great

811
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,759
relationship with John Hopkins as a good

812
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,599
example but they don't always include us

813
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,159
in everything that they're doing and so

814
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,800
how do we start chemotyping these and

815
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,039
including more of the aroma complexes

816
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,519
the Cannabis chemistry that is really

817
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,358
defining the experience of these

818
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:01,639
products so that it's not subjectively

819
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:03,759
tailored towards cannaboids alone and

820
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,759
secondarily if we have time love to just

821
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,119
listen Maybe what's your most favorite

822
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,280
research on the horizon that you guys

823
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,559
are most excited

824
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,760
about thank you let's start with the one

825
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,320
and I don't know we'll see if there's no

826
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,599
more questions then we'll we'll hit that

827
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,519
second question but uh maybe with this

828
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,079
first question go ahead

829
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:23,800
Justin um it's a great question um the

830
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:26,760
role of tpan terpenoids um as an example

831
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,280
of these aromatics is um it's becoming

832
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,040
better appreciated but it's still not

833
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,560
well understood there's been um

834
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:36,239
alternative classification systems uh

835
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,599
for genotyping proposed on uh on terpine

836
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,439
synthesis Pathways um which is an

837
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:45,880
interesting sort of way to look at the

838
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,440
plant um I don't know that there is a um

839
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't know that there's a like a

840
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,240
silver bullet kind of approach to how do

841
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,760
we generate more um research on um the

842
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:58,838
role of turpins but I think it has to be

843
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,400
addressed um from initially maybe a

844
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:04,318
therapeutic perspective right um and so

845
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,240
in order to do that we also have to have

846
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:11,559
a better understanding of the TP tpine

847
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:12,639
profiles and ratios um of the source

848
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:14,960
material that's being used

849
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,480
therapeutically right so we have a very

850
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,318
limited sort of understanding already uh

851
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,440
having to do with the canabo profile of

852
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:26,318
what's being used um as a medical

853
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,960
cannabis product um in most cases people

854
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:30,599
aren't really paying attention into the

855
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,880
ratios and um and the contents at

856
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,680
anything but a superficial level so um

857
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,400
making sure that that becomes part of

858
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,440
the

859
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,280
conversation um that you have an

860
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,960
informed patient consumer and then that

861
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,720
goes to the practitioner and I think

862
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,000
that maybe drives research um uh maybe

863
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,879
it's the other way around but um I think

864
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,838
part of it is just educating people um

865
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,880
about uh the role um and you can look at

866
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:01,559
them in abstract right you can look at

867
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,960
fractionated isolated tpin um where

868
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,799
they're derived from you can look at how

869
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,559
they act isolation but really what we're

870
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,039
looking at is a synergistic hold in the

871
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,000
relationship so I would say you start

872
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,480
with um making that more of a

873
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,960
conversation at that entry level yeah

874
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,079
agreed I don't know if we have any more

875
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,920
time I think we're out of time uh we

876
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,400
don't uh sorry I wish we could sit here

877
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,159
all day talk with these panelists with

878
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,800
questions but inos here I'm very strict

879
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:31,480
let's hear it again for the whole panel

880
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,480
that was very informative
