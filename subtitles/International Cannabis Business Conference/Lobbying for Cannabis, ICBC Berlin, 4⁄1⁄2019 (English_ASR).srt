28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,990
the industry was in the main cooper

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,390
dispensary scene much like myself he

30
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,789
went on to become CEO of M&amp;A Canada in

31
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,489
2015 which was a company that was based

32
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,590
both in BC and in Ontario and he's

33
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,209
currently well I still with the lost

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,490
organization as well which will give it

35
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,319

X based out of Switzerland so please

37
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,500
welcome

38
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,419
so we've got a little bit of a longer

39
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:57,150
introduction in normal - because Lobby

40
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,409
for cannabis is a really weird thing

41
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,728
when most people think of lobbying you

42
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,769
think you're gonna have to try and

43
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:04,060
convince a politician to do something

44
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,978
that's probably not going to make the

45
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,269
government a lot of money and probably

46
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:09,849
not going to make people feel better

47
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,829
people think of Big Pharma they think of

48
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,169
big tobacco when they think of lobbyists

49
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,969
and with cannabis it's sort of the

50
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,500
opposite you're trying to convince a

51
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,120
politician to do something that will

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,590
help a lot of people and make the

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
government a lot of money and they still

54
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,580
don't actually want to do it it's kind

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,009
of like arguing with a two-year-old or

56
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,540
that expression about playing chess with

57
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,620
the pigeon doesn't really matter if you

58
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,000
win they're still going to knock over

59
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:37,659
all the pieces of [ __ ] all over the

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,300
world is very kind of heavily Canadian

61
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,370
and German we're going to go through

62
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,200
very quickly the lobbying challenges and

63
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,289
issues that we have in Canada going from

64
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,849
fully illegal to fully illegal and then

65
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,039
we'll kind of delve into where we are a

66
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,370
Germany and what the specific issues are

67
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,870
here and how we move forward from there

68
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,430
so my own background was in lobbying in

69
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,009
a federal government that absolutely

70
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,540
hated cannabis I then tried to lobby a

71
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,518
provincial government that didn't really

72
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,229
care one way or another I then found

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,719
some city governments that absolutely

74
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:09,548
here the federal government they were

75
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,620
actually willing to give some licenses

76
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,209
to illegal businesses that worked out

77
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,950
pretty well because within six months

78
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,039
that government was no longer in power

79
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:21,849
and we had the Canadian Liberals who had

80
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:24,280
won on a policy of legalization at that

81
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,900
point distribution was given to

82
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,030
provinces and some different provinces

83
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,099
we're taking different approaches in

84
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,479
Ontario they decided they wanted to run

85
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,650
all of the stories themselves and they

86
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,569
were just going to shut down all of the

87
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,180
existing privately run details which is

88
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,129
why I went to go work with them MJ and

89
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,349
we started lobbying in Ontario and now

90
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:43,090
Ontario does help private retail but it

91
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,030
also sort of resulted in a government

92
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,930
getting kicked out in order to do it

93
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,879
yeah client you want to come and tell

94
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,879
that story yeah thank you very much for

95
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,120
having me guys yeah so Ontario Canada

96
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:58,750
although MMJ Canada was based Canada

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,700
east to west in Vancouver Nelson BC and

98
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:05,150
in Ontario it was really tricky and on

99
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:07,399
because Damien said the the structure in

100
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,469
the format was kind of already in place

101
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,870
due to the due diligence of people like

102
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:14,989
Jamie in Vancouver and in British

103
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,949
Columbia but it seemed as we opened up

104
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,540
M&amp;J Canada's in Ontario the government

105
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,389
was right in the middle of an election

106
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,370
and a lady named Kathleen Wynne who was

107
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,610
the Premier of Ontario at the time

108
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,040
wanted to put it in Elle CBO's which is

109
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,590
government-run liquor distribution store

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,620
our style model they wanted to call the

111
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:39,769
OCS or Part B the C CEO at one point

112
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,478
they then changed to the OCS but then

113
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:43,189
has power changed it went from the

114
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:45,259
Liberal Party to the Conservative Party

115
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:46,850
were then Doug Ford said he wanted to

116
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,639
privatize and have an open and free

117
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,620
market which at the end of all said that

118
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,470
never even happened either unfortunately

119
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,110
there ended up with 25 licenses and

120
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,060
certain restrictions so in the very

121
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,439
beginning of MMJ Canada which I've been

122
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,319
speaking here now this is my third year

123
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,939
if anybody was here before we were very

124
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,889
mark identity medical cannabis

125
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,850
dispensary so I spent a lot of my time

126
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,710
dealing with police raids you know

127
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,960
conflict resolution and I realized that

128
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:18,560
no matter how much of a standard that

129
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,239
you set for a government or a brand you

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,160
are gonna be painted as the same brush

131
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,090
when you're in the illegal in the listed

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,680
market I then started logging

133
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:29,239
municipalities and I asked Jamie to fly

134
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,819
in because she was my government

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,668
relations director at the time and I was

136
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:37,099
struggling with you know a lot of the

137
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:39,439
aspects of Ontario and it was becoming

138
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,539
frustrating so Jamie kind of came out to

139
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,969
fly out with me and work with the city a

140
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,860
Hamilton which is my hometown and we

141
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,289
started lobbying the city councillors

142
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,990
and speaking in front of different City

143
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:55,879
pardon me you got the city you know the

144
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,348
regulator view the city regulators and

145
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,360
it got to the point where we're actually

146
00:05:57,348 --> 00:06:01,728
making a lot of headway with the city

147
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,288
municipalities and at one point I was

148
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,209
like wow Hamilton is going to give us

149
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,620
temporary licenses and this is really

150
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:09,319
mingkun we might be the first city

151
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,120
besides Vancouver ahead of the time for

152
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,879
Ontario that might produce these

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,470
licenses but unfortunately as I realize

154
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,779
now which is a mistake that I made

155
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,450
CEO of Edmonton Canada was that I was

156
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,819
lobbying the wrong people as much as the

157
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,560
municipalities had say as Jamie said

158
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,909
there was one municipality in all of

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,000
Canada that decided to really

160
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,800
essentially allow these licenses to

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,699
happen before legalization or jerk

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,900
searchers as a few a few yeah very minor

163
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,979
Ontario there was none at the time and I

164
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,959
really thought I was going to break

165
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,240
ground with Hamilton and then the

166
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,909
province came in and they literally just

167
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,040
squashed it so the issues that I had and

168
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,980
I realized was that I might have been

169
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,750
lobbying the wrong people I feel that

170
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,970
you need to include well in Canada goes

171
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,490
you know municipality provinces in the

172
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,680
federal I realize now that if I was to

173
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,769
have to redo it again which I will never

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,329
do it again but if I had to I would

175
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:04,189
start with the province in the federal

176
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:05,180
and then worked out of the municipality

177
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,149
because there's only so much the

178
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,379
municipalities can do any went do it

179
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,399
against them a second for punishment

180
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:15,019
yeah so back to be see we had some

181
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,929
cities that were on the board we had a

182
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:20,029
province that was fairly progressive we

183
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,980
had federal legalization we had

184
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:24,079
succeeded in giving smaller licenses we

185
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,819
succeeded in getting edibles and

186
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,609
topicals coming which were all major

187
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,620
issues and then I would move forward we

188
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,220
found that all of the issues came back

189
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,319
down to the cities again Susan you were

190
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,780
a councillor in Squamish which was a

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,909
small town in a progressive province

192
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,609
under legalization is what kind of

193
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,280
challenges the game next and what are we

194
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,330
doing now thanks Jamie that's an

195
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,329
excellent question

196
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:55,250
so municipalities in British Columbia

197
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:56,750
have no access to taxation so it's

198
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,100
really interesting that Clinton spoke

199
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,290
about their multiple levels of

200
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,840
government which i think is pretty much

201
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,450
global you have different regulations

202
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:08,329
coming out from the feds and different

203
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,509
regulations at the problems and they had

204
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,918
basically split the taxes between the

205
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,649
province and the feds

206
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:18,709
so the municipalities have no access to

207
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:21,349
taxation from Canada's yet they are the

208
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:24,379
ones that are dealing with police bylaws

209
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,390
land-use struggles allowing land use for

210
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:30,180
cannabis so at the City Councilor

211
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:33,539
I recognize I was a closeted canvas user

212
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,070
because I was a politician but I have to

213
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,039
become an advocate for the industry

214
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,590
because we had a massive industry in

215
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,349
Squamish much of our economy came from

216
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:46,110
him even though we could prove it and I

217
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,610
work in a clinic that deals with cancer

218
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,139
patients and my patients were driving

219
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,710
down the highway to access their

220
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,259
medicine

221
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,940
we had no dispensary laws we weren't

222
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,789
licensing anything and I knew

223
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,790
legalization was coming and I thought

224
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:01,949
this is a giant policy hole we have just

225
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,620
we have no dispensaries we have no

226
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,830
access to canvas for patients and we

227
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,419
have no land use for cultivation

228
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,220
although I didn't realize how big

229
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,829
cultivation was because I can really

230
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,470
enter in as an advocate for the industry

231
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,420
I started writing bylaws and it's funny

232
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,730
because much of my bylaw work was based

233
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:22,259
on Jamie before we have even met based

234
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,740
on the work that Jamie and Clint had

235
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,899
done in other regions and I started

236
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,370
writing bylaws and I instead of going

237
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,019
through staff and saying this is how

238
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,060
this has to happen and can you please

239
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,069
write something I just presented the

240
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,259
bylaw and in two weeks we voted on it

241
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,540
of course it failed because there wasn't

242
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,509
any education and it wasn't legal yet

243
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:45,589
and so I had to pass it two more times

244
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:48,389
and in order to pass it the third time I

245
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,120
had to change the regulations to be

246
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:54,689
pretty prohibitive for cultivation so we

247
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,940
put in numbers that work based on any

248
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,950
science or facts they were based on

249
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,470
federal regulations in the United States

250
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,810
for 200 meters setbacks for any cannabis

251
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,560
business so if you were a dispensary or

252
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:09,629
a cultivator or any sort of extraction

253
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:13,169
business you had to be to intervenors

254
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:15,899
from other businesses were 12 kilometers

255
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:18,809
long so it's you could basically have

256
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,279
five cannabis businesses and all of

257
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,919
those licenses got taken up with

258
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,829
dispensaries so we still have a massive

259
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,589
illegal business and we still have no

260
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,379
taxation and can in British Columbia and

261
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,810
in all municipalities so the work that

262
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,360
I've started to focus on now as

263
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:38,879
I ran for mayor and I failed to get in

264
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,800
as mayor because we also have populist

265
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:45,480
politics in Canada now and lobbying for

266
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,959
candidates afterwards became my passion

267
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,000
because access to full botanicals access

268
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,920
to the plant I'm also work in science so

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,870
access to the plant for medical research

270
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,349
and understanding where the full

271
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:03,720
spectrum botanical does it is incredibly

272
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:05,940
important for many reasons lobbying the

273
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,110
province has become so that we can

274
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,730
actually have a tax share of

275
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,550
municipalities and be able to pay for

276
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,830
our RCP and our bylaws and so that but

277
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:15,419
not municipalities feel like they have

278
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,730
some skin in the game if you're not

279
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:20,459
gaining any resources there's no reason

280
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,860
to move forward with policy so speaking

281
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,050
to politicians and explaining the

282
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,000
economic benefits I've tried to build

283
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,729
some economic models I've tried to

284
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,259
explain the importance of modeling the

285
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,170
economics of it and not just talking

286
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:37,649
about patients and medicine because for

287
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:41,240
me it's recreation and that's equally as

288
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:43,319
important it's it's medical but not just

289
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,509
absolutely well and all of these pieces

290
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,370
fit together so we have legal hemp we

291
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,809
have legal medical cannabis we have

292
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,240
legal recreational cannabis

293
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,129
we've got edibles and topicals coming

294
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,830
we've got smaller licenses that we've

295
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:58,710
been wanting and now we're fighting to

296
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,690
be able to grow good cannabis Organic

297
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,970
cannabis we're fighting to be able to

298
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,089
actually grow an agricultural product on

299
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,670
agricultural land so that's sort of the

300
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:10,350
issues where we're at now Burkhart was

301
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:12,329
some of those patterns he's probably

302
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,909
pretty familiar to you

303
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,190
one of your main objectives when you

304
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:20,459
were in said it was to give cost-free

305
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,070
access to patients to cannabis you were

306
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,810
pretty successful at that he removed

307
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,170
some of the bureaucracy that was

308
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:30,419
involved Canada invented healthcare and

309
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:33,629
we still tax medicine we're still not

310
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:36,240
doing it right what were the challenges

311
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:37,588
for you to even get to that point and

312
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,159
how are you successful in one of the

313
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,160
outstanding issues

381
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:07,169
experience as well and kind of haven't

382
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,030
had success by working with the smaller

383
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:10,620
governments but as Susan said are gonna

384
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,389
end up having to deal with most of these

385
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,269
issues anyway they're the ones spending

386
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,370
the resources George you've also been

387
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,759
involved in this fight for a very long

388
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,470
time what are some of the biggest issues

389
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,360
for you right now and what are some of

390
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,250
the tactics that factory Jennifer friend

391
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:32,310
uses to to actually try and make change

392
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:35,730
well about the tactics accidentally I

393
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:41,819
googled the word lobbyism

394
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:44,490
last week another reason not because of

395
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,970
this panel here and Lobby isn't means

396
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:52,370
make political contact

397
00:16:47,970 --> 00:17:00,028
to get something to get something

398
00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:03,269
decided on for others for association of

399
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:05,699
people for network of people somehow

400
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:09,689
whatever network that is political

401
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:13,110
context but also public relations work

402
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:17,939
to convince people and that is what we

403
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:20,668
do all the time since 2002 since German

404
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,890
cannabis Association exists that what

405
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:27,299
were the main things and the public

406
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:30,990
relation thing is in one part over our

407
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:35,819
own channels I think we have the

408
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:42,000
strongest social media channels at all

409
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:45,359
I'd say I've found no other NGO in the

410
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,419
scene or Amnesty International or

411
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:51,538
whatever as strong as we are every week

412
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:54,000
pushing out which new people and that

413
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:58,819
made us really strong

414
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,669
every time when there's something to

415
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:04,558
take actually when we call for action

416
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:08,009
every time we were very successful for

417
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:11,869
example 2017 we had the strongest

418
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:14,819
petition in the Bundestag of the year

419
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:17,339
calling for legalization and I can

420
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:20,819
mention lots of other things like that

421
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:23,369
we were really on the forefront when it

422
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:27,960
was about asking people for something

423
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:31,308
and we see the results we see more and

424
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,960
more people in the public public opinion

425
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:36,960
favoring legalization when we started

426
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,788
when I at the first the first Paula

427
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:46,350
Ebben - 2010 it was 19 percent of public

428
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:49,470
in favor of legalization since 2014 we

429
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:52,558
make it every year asked people and a

430
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:58,319
representative Paul and was now talk to

431
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:59,950
some 14 it was 30 percent last year it

432
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:03,369
was 46

433
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:06,160
so we are arriving slowly at majority

434
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:07,689
and there is something we need to

435
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,180
convince politicians as we heard before

436
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,059
we don't have the majority to get it

437
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:17,140
right through now right I think that's

438
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:21,429
ok because that's part of the Democratic

439
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,650
game somehow we can't think politicians

440
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,930
should do the right thing just because

441
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,050
it's the right thing when the people

442
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:32,380
don't want it so we have to have that

443
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:35,440
majority and we so will in a bit and

444
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,330
also the same thing is when you are

445
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,480
politicians when you look into the

446
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:43,089
parliaments when I started doing before

447
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,809
the end of the 90s only the Green Party

448
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:49,329
was for legalization then the Left Party

449
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:51,909
came at the pole that the Liberals came

450
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:54,069
at the boat now the Social Democrats I

451
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,890
hope are soon in the boat

452
00:19:54,069 --> 00:20:00,159
Buchan is one of the guys leading the

453
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:03,310
way to that point and then finally

454
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,560
everything comes together the nice day

455
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,750
will come to legalize also in Germany

456
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,099
yeah well then it takes education it

457
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,769
takes constant effort and it takes

458
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:12,969
thinking outside of the box some of the

459
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,619
kind of more interesting things that

460
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,839
you've done that or not may be typical

461
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:19,059
in other jurisdictions is you went a

462
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,429
million euros on a TV show and turn that

463
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:24,159
into Europe's first cinematic anti

464
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,370
prohibition campaign you also want to

465
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,930
pole to be able to talk to Angela Merkel

466
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:32,829
how did that go and what did you say to

467
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:39,850
her yeah also actually two times it was

468
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:43,419
a little bit I think Oh bah idea when he

469
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:46,990
tried to get contact to the public oh

470
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:49,150
the internet internet community asking

471
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,579
questions and the best voted questions

472
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,710
he would answer do something that's

473
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:56,500
something Mac I've tried also first

474
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,630
thing was via YouTube ask me questions

475
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,230
the 10 most voted questions I will

476
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,620
answer

477
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:06,640
so we asked why don't realise marijuana

478
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:10,629
and out of six thousand questions this

479
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:15,190
was number one and she too outside and

480
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:17,260
the answer was well not very informed

481
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,690
like well we can't recognize it because

482
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:23,379
of cultural reasons I call this our

483
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:26,500
cultural comedies and cannabis is very

484
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:30,130
highly addictive and so on and then she

485
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,829
tried it with an on platform not

486
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,570
question this time but suggestions she

487
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:38,379
said what was good for the future

488
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:41,259
Germany the 10 best voted suggestions

489
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,960
I will him personally invite you in my

490
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:47,470
office and so on we were on place to or

491
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,650
of eleven thousand suggestions and so I

492
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:55,079
was first come up with lobbyists talking

493
00:21:50,650 --> 00:22:00,040
to the German Chancellor and at least I

494
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:02,769
convinced her to call for expert panel

495
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:06,549
and several answers of the first round

496
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:10,920
were very bad informed so please ask

497
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:13,750
some experts and at least that Chile did

498
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,460
nice well I mean and I mean this is you

499
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,990
know there's a lot of moving pieces to

500
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,779
this you know where could have mentioned

501
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,329
earlier that there was initiatives in

502
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,910
the 90s well Canada tried to legalize in

503
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:26,319
the seventies and the next days we don't

504
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,620
know you can't do that you might know

505
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:33,579
okay all right and then nothing again

506
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:35,829
until 10 years of courts saying you have

507
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:38,470
to fix this and the government doing the

508
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:41,980
worst possible job on purpose because

509
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:45,100
they didn't want it fixed right Burkhart

510
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,500
you again so this is this kills me a

511
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,939
little bit Canada is is one of the

512
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,519
things that we're very proud of is that

513
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,940
we're a country that invented

514
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,849
national healthcare when we've had legal

515
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,980
medical cannabis for over a decade

516
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:01,289
we still don't cover it the way we cover

517
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,269
other medications we actually tax it

518
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,789
we've added more tax on to it that no

519
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:08,549
medical patients have to pay and they

520
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,589
can't get back which is not in line at

521
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:12,119
all with Canadian culture when you want

522
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:15,839
to talk about traditional cultures and

523
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:18,500
values this was again I mean focus of

524
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,819
your work and you were very successful

525
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,490
but as we've discovered with everything

526
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,169
else has never really done so what are

527
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,779
the other specific issues that you feel

528
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,680
around medical cannabis in particular

529
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:31,579
that that really need to be addressed

530
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,580
here in Germany

531
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:43,269

for failure it makes me very happy

591
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,288
because you know in Canada and most

592
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,460
other jurisdictions that we've seen

593
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:31,679
medical has been thrown under the bus

594
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,509
they're not trying to fix medical there

595
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,570
are no politicians standing up for

596
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:38,069
medical so you know hopefully you guys

597
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:40,349
get that right so that we can look to

598
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:43,379
you and go okay that's how we fix our

599
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,969
system this is the other interesting

600
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,740
thing that I find about cannabis is

601
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,329
every jurisdiction that you go to says

602
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,400
what we're different when we're not like

603
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:52,529
that other jurisdictions oh they're

604
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,210
loose and we're not we're a very EMS K

605
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,009
when you actually look at all the

606
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,798
jurisdictions they end up following the

607
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:00,750
same pattern how it plays out there's

608
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,538
sometimes a little bit a different hue

609
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,369
in the shape but it all ends up being

610
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,200
the same pattern sometimes it may take

611
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:09,599
ten years to take one step sometimes

612
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,038
that step will happen in a month but it

613
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,959
ends up sort of following the same

614
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,450
pattern and one of the things one of the

615
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,009
reasons why I love ICBC and coming to

616
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,380
conferences around the world is that

617
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,119
when Vancouver decided to license

618
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,659
illegal businesses they didn't do it in

619
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,029
a vacuum

620
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,289
I had prepared a report for them and

621
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:28,200
showed them what happened in California

622
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:29,700
cities when a city decided that they

623
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,319
were going to regulate cannabis for the

624
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,029
benefit of patients and for the benefit

625
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,250
of their communities they had really

626
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:36,750
good roles that work just fine until the

627
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,759
states came along and screwed the month

628
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,648
and then the states we've kind of come

629
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,390
along screw him up a little bit but he

630
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:43,589
had compared that other cities that were

631
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,860
trying to fight it and we were

632
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:46,569
discussing this in the green

633
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:48,579
a little bit George about how they you

634
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:50,710
know the more that prohibitionist try

635
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:52,869
and actually clamp down on it the worse

636
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,789
it actually gets for everybody it

637
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:57,308
becomes a little bit more of a wild west

638
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:01,089
scenario it becomes harder to track

639
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:02,649
things down and front from just a public

640
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:05,379
health perspective it makes a lot more

641
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:06,850
sense to have brick-and-mortar locations

642
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,920
where you can go with look or to have

643
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:11,678
testing regulations around cannabis or

644
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,808
how you can grow it but do not go too

645
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,309
far with it

646
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:17,168
George where do you think we are next

647
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:19,839
what do you think the next fight is here

648
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:22,000
in Germany and how is that going to be

649
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:27,129
affected by or affect the nations around

650
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,380
you well there are a lot of things we

651
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:32,740
have to care about at the moment some

652
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:36,630
very concrete problems on the medical

653
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:40,029
base it's not that everybody gets

654
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:43,830
reimbursement from medicine even if you

655
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:47,859
have a recipe about one third of the

656
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:52,210
proposals are taken mother adventurin

657
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:55,298
insurances the prices are very high for

658
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:58,470
one gram it's more than 20 euros per

659
00:28:55,298 --> 00:29:02,819
gram and German pharmacies which is

660
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:07,419
German will critique our trip somehow

661
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:10,689
not easy to get all this we have the

662
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:13,900
soft shortage problems and so on so

663
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:18,519
there are many details we are fighting

664
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:21,820
for and also things about the

665
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:24,339
criminalization of consumers the

666
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:28,689
driver's license issue is a very big one

667
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:31,389
in Germany because here a lot of sour

668
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:35,320
people lose that driver's license

669
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:39,040
because we have here the limit of one

670
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:41,829
nanogram THC per milliliter and that is

671
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,579
very very low a lot of leading and ever

672
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:46,589
and they were driving ever

673
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:49,439
I will never be night away with Germany

674
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:51,509
everything so that is an issue I don't

675
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,160
know how fast we come forward but that's

676
00:29:51,509 --> 00:30:00,359
a big issue for us to push a lot of the

677
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:03,150
criminalization as such we are every

678
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,669
year we have a new record it's a it

679
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:09,290
sounds like a rail we are coming it's

680
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:13,680
going forward in Germany but the

681
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:17,279
repression is still rising so that's

682
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,500
also an issue and maybe we have a

683
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,750
majority in the parliament soon about

684
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:27,390
that it's a little step well as far as

685
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:31,319
legalization but when we say well if you

686
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:34,710
have got 10 grams people donate or take

687
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:36,750
it as a donor can say misty mana or

688
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,759
something and I was gonna just play

689
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,700
little pine and that's it and no record

690
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,359
and so on maybe we come further on that

691
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,500
front

692
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:49,919
and as Bach had said the cities to play

693
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,819
a big role in Germany because he and the

694
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:57,779
German drug war we have a loophole it's

695
00:30:53,819 --> 00:31:00,450
an idea that the scientifical model

696
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:03,690
projects are possible and that's how

697
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:06,660
Germany tested 10 years ago or 15 years

698
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:10,680
ago the distribution of heroin and that

699
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:12,450
was very successful and now doctors camp

700
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,390
is quite harrowing and that's the same

701
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:18,299
idea for cannabis and when I said we

702
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:23,550
come closer to majorities also the

703
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:26,879
political field we see now majorities in

704
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:29,940
cities the first little province with F

705
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,080
majorities cornpone utilization but what

706
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,789
yet in the boom stack and that might be

707
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:41,309
the right tool to bring power from

708
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:44,909
bottom down like grassroot thing like in

709
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:47,149
the States is that's the interesting

710
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,150
thing

711
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:50,819
what jurisdiction you look at it came

712
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:52,498
from the bottom up and it's when

713
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,638
studying people at the top goal okay

714
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:55,308
we're gonna make the rules that

715
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:59,248
everything starts kind of going sideways

716
00:31:55,308 --> 00:32:00,720
Clint you're in Switzerland now what are

717
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:03,450
some of the challenges that are going to

718
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,179
be there and how does what Switzerland

719
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,370
does affects what goes on in the rest of

720
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:11,548
Europe well it's one it seems to be a

721
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:14,819
little easier for manufacturing

722
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:18,980
industrial hemp CBD as a great now

723
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:20,908
you're free to grow and manufacture

724
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:25,378
industrial heavy CVD as long as it's

725
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:27,330
under 1% I've noticed that our one

726
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:29,668
partner Tobias Jenny who's fortunately

727
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:31,528
in Tel Aviv retail he is the founder of

728
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:33,119
the medical cannabis Association in

729
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:35,069
Switzerland so he's been working with

730
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:37,859
the state and her different competitions

731
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:39,240
and from my understanding Tobias is

732
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:42,949
explained me very well that there are a

733
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,710
lot more communicative than Canada was

734
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:49,169
there hasn't seen as many as near as

735
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,350
many issues as I went through being a

736
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:54,059
completely grey market and to the the

737
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:57,209
way it's viewed in Switzerland

738
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:58,918
regulated so it's a lot more easier on

739
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,829
us to operate and to work with the

740
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,210
government I'm kind of excited to see

741
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:06,118
what happens with Switzerland and the

742
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,210
THC testing in the next few months and

743
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:11,099
years to come but again it's a lot

744
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,649
easier than what was happening in Canada

745
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:15,509
just to touch back onto what Susan was

746
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:18,329
saying you know the municipalities

747
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:20,399
didn't have any money coming in through

748
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,230
taxes it was one of the things that

749
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,089
really frustrated me the most in Canada

750
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,339
when I was working with it that you have

751
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:28,408
these people that want these counselors

752
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,788
and the municipalities to help but

753
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:32,879
they're you know has also a counselor

754
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:36,690
unique city tax money coming in to grow

755
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:38,638
infrastructure roads education you know

756
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,019
harm reduction sites and when there's

757
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:41,819
nothing coming in for them it makes it

758
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,308
really hard for them to step on your

759
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,839
side for lobbying especially in parts of

760
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:46,918
Canada each province is you know

761
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,689
extremely different

762
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,850
we're summer really proactive and some

763
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,220
are in Ontario at the time really wasn't

764
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:55,230
although my city of Hamilton was I

765
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,659
really wish there was more people like

766
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,440
Susan who from a councillors point of

767
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:01,600
view although she knew

768
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,120
that there has to be tax coming in and

769
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,429
you know a benefit for the city for it

770
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:09,369
to make sense she played a major role in

771
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:12,010
advocacy so did Jamie and what I've

772
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:13,839
noticed the in Canada which is actually

773
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,690
kind of impressive some of the best

774
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,570
lobbyists cannabis and ain't talked

775
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:21,190
about a little more for females and

776
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,500
they're really good at what they do it's

777
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:26,079
awesome and you know it's counselors

778
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,969
like Susan - people like Jamie when it

779
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,739
comes to the lobbying aspects that I've

780
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,079
looked up to for a long time lobbying

781
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:34,209
was not my wheelhouse there was a reason

782
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,489
why I've dropped champion - Ontario to

783
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,829
help with me because I'm somebody that

784
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:40,329
wears my heart on my sleeve I speaking

785
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,130
about mental health and cannabis a lot

786
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,569
more than thank you anything else so I'm

787
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:47,769
quite passionate and I'm very vulnerable

788
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:49,900
to getting defensive and kind of coming

789
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:52,000
across with a little bit of fire so when

790
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,950
I wanted to do what I wanted to do in

791
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,599
Ontario I knew that I had to reach out

792
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:58,509
to someone and you know you hear a lot

793
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,670
of the power Corp cement and strong men

794
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,440
and all that and I always reach out to

795
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,570
the females I felt like the females have

796
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,039
been doing the strongest in logging and

797
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:09,250
in all of Canada and making the most

798
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:12,099
effect and again I'm super thankful for

799
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:15,190
people like Susan you black Jamie Shaw

800
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,360
all these people doing things and they

801
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,829
should be given the credit they deserve

802
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,610
because they're the ones leading the

803
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:20,610
forefront for this

804
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:29,710
I actually just wish that our Parliament

805
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,870
had more politicians like Burkhart I

806
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,490
actually cared about patience um because

807
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:36,400
again this is an issue that we've seen

808
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:39,669
everywhere Washington says well we've

809
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,260
got medical program but you know you're

810
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,150
not really allowed to sell it so all of

811
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,920
these businesses pop up and they're

812
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,990
illegal and they're selling only to

813
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,550
people that the state says is allowed to

814
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:50,409
have cameras but they're not allowed to

815
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,250
sell it and then they suddenly go okay

816
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:53,529
you know what we're gonna do

817
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,690
recreational cannabis so all of those

818
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,370
now medical ones are now a legal and and

819
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,139
again that's sort of a pattern that we

820
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:02,170
keep seeing so I hope we definitely do

821
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:04,299
not see that in Germany Burkhard what's

822
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:07,030
your take on how what Germany does

823
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,560
affects what goes on around it what some

824
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:13,570

yeah well and and it's for me I love the

different jurisdictions doing different

843
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:17,229
sort of different things because that's

844
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:19,269
how you can sort of see a Miss does work

845
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,190
or this doesn't work if everybody does

846
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:24,070
the same thing it takes a lot longer to

847
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,900
get anywhere and Susan all kind of with

848
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,640
you just before we go to a quick Q&amp;A and

849
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,079
what are your thoughts on what comes

850
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,319
next in terms of

851
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,590
global Lobby Thanks

852
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,780
excellent question I really feel that we

853
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:41,289
need to focus on more of the vertical

854
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:42,640
integration it's not just about the

855
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:45,159
cannabis and the cultivation that

856
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,739
politicians need to realize this is a

857
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,899
huge economic generator for their

858
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:53,289
municipalities for their provinces and

859
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,480
for their country the country that makes

860
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:57,880
it legal across all of the vertical

861
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,099
change the ancillary businesses and the

862
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,970
economics surrounding cannabis is

863
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:08,009
enormous this entry prohibition you

864
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:08,009
don't add sorry exiting prohibition is

865
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:14,489
exiting prohibition for any industry

866
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,940
it's only happened a few times in

867
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:19,239
hundreds of years

868
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:22,360
so products leaving an illegal market

869
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:25,329
into a legal market it's massive

870
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,640
opportunity as you all know explaining

871
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:30,250
that and modeling it for politicians and

872
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,469
being able to speak the same values as

873
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:35,170
politicians have being able to research

874
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:37,239
in advance what the politicians are

875
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,090
looking for and being able to speak to

876
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:42,579
the level that the level of government

877
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:45,789
needs to understand so whether it be

878
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:49,239
economic benefits or medicinal benefits

879
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:52,750
cultural benefits financial benefits

880
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:56,019
it's all really important and there's so

881
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:58,119
many there's so much lobbying to be done

882
00:38:56,019 --> 00:39:00,610
and it's going to take multiple

883
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:09,429
communities and also cannabis users need

884
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:11,950
to vote that's massively relate for

885
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:14,949
hours about as we covered topics very

886
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:16,569
very quickly in bio and there are any

887
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:18,129
questions from the audience I'm sure

888
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,269
there is a question or two what's here

889
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,630
to gain from the panel that was

890
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:27,929
fantastic

891
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:27,930
[Applause]

892
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:42,420
of course exactly our right now so I

893
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:46,140
just wanted to assure Linda you weren't

894
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:48,300
wrong and lobbying local politicians you

895
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:50,819
have to remember when booze was illegal

896
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,830
we had all the win areas in the dry

897
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,769
areas one of the biggest problems now

898
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:57,900
while we managed to you know go after

899
00:39:55,769 --> 00:40:02,519
the federal government that control

900
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:04,800
provision the provinces distribution its

901
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:06,840
local governments that decide where your

902
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,320
store is going to be and not and so on

903
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:13,890
and that's a big problem in a lot of

904
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,059
areas and also landlord-tenant sorts of

905
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:17,909
things so you're really going to figure

906
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:21,269
out who's in charge of what in terms of

907
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:22,799
the lobbying to focus and just like a

908
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:26,099
quick thing about the impaired driving

909
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,840
thing you all have to remember that well

910
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:30,960
of course the Janie's case she's always

911
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,240
over five nanograms but most of us if

912
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,769
you only smoke once in a while it'll

913
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,579
stay in your system for 90 days so

914
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:40,440
remember that if they pull you over

915
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,960
officer it was three months ago

916
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,320
yes and just because this deserves a

917
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,210
shout out lobbying work is one piece of

918
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,190
the puzzle and we would not have been

919
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,900
anywhere near as successful if it wasn't

920
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:55,519
for leaders like John Connolly who

921
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,519
fought for 30 40 years

922
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:06,788
yeah I would like to understand where is

923
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:10,208
precisely if there is an inquisition on

924
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:13,839
the real pile of an adoption we heard

925
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:17,129
this morning that there is from

926
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:20,349
education to do for the clinical doctors

927
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:25,150
they not know exactly what cannabis is

928
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:28,298
doing and they they are reluctant to use

929
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:30,429
it and on the other side we can see that

930
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:35,559
there is most probably also an education

931
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:42,429
to do for the politician to push the

932
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:46,209
head different new law so on the other

933
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:51,548
hand we see that Canada is quite

934
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:55,629
advanced in such process I'm wondering

935
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:59,349
if the Canadians doctor are different

936
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:03,130
from European I presume that they are

937
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:05,579
not well educated so probably the

938
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:09,660
question is where to put the focus on

939
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:11,709
clinician or on politician everywhere

940
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:13,928
well one of the issues that we're having

941
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:16,509
now is that some of the strongest

942
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:19,028
blowback is actually coming from Medical

943
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:20,619
Association's meanwhile there's doctors

944
00:42:19,028 --> 00:42:22,150
like dr. mark where we've been

945
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:24,068
spearheading this and there's research

946
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,619
for a long time and they can't even

947
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:29,528
convince their peers of stuff that we've

948
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:31,209
got weaves of research on so I mean it

949
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:33,579
literally it takes six multiple fronts

950
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:35,198
it's not on one front more and it's a

951
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:37,749
full spectrum of technical and that's

952
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,688
not a usual plant that's given as

953
00:42:37,748 --> 00:42:43,509
medicine so it's a bit of a drug looking

954
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:45,338
for a disease as well because the we

955
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:48,009
haven't had access to do research and

956
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:49,808
yet the physicians fair enough they're

957
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:51,608
being told here's a drug we don't know

958
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:54,009
when it's good for but it seems to cover

959
00:42:51,608 --> 00:42:56,288
a lot of bases and they don't know

960
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:57,759
dosing they don't know how it is given

961
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:59,589
so the education for medical

962
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:02,228
practitioners is massive because there

963
00:42:59,588 --> 00:43:04,929
is research now that supports use of

964
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:07,358
cannabis but again is it spoke is it

965
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:07,840
faked how is it adjusted what kind of

966
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,480
exam

967
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,490
and that so many questions still around

968
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,780
this absolutely Greg that was fantastic

969
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,779
thank you so very much

970
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:33,719
you

971
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,739
the lobbying discussion in particular is

972
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:39,799
difficult and there's some issues in

973
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:42,019
this industry that are persistent and

974
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,820
have not been solved yet and I think

975
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:46,159
it's fair to say that everybody on this

976
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:49,220
panel believes that in some way some of

977
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:51,649
the larger industry issues in part can

978
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:54,019
be solved by technology or at least

979
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:57,590
greatly aided so I'm gonna throw this

980
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:59,750
question out immediately what and where

981
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,930
do you think technology of whatever kind

982
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:05,449
can help to continue revolutionising

983
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:08,000
this business and if those of you guys

984
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,109
don't do like Storz and Bickel is that's

985
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,250
who's sitting next to me so I'm gonna

986
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,450
throw it to you quickly because

987
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,480
everybody knows your vape and your

988
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:16,939
international yeah thank you very much

989
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,449
madam yes my name is Jurgen beaker from

990
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:23,800
sauce and pickle we are producing

991
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:26,689
vaporizers our first revolutionising

992
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,260
technology was in the year 2000 when we

993
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,329
product volcano vaporizer on the market

994
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:34,510
before the time you had to smoke it yeah

995
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:39,579
more or less or to eat it there was no

996
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:41,900
no as a viable way so this was a one

997
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:42,349
revolution but what's today is very

998
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,420
normal

999
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:46,940
everybody knows vaporizer tons of

1000
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,700
products out there so it become a very

1001
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:53,349
mainstream I believe the application

1002
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:55,369
form will be in the future more

1003
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:58,039
revolutionising we see all this

1004
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:59,929
concentrate vaporizers it will go

1005
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:02,480
forward in this direction we see our

1006
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:04,460
alternatives like capsules but you can

1007
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,440
in chess so I believe they are the

1008
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,699
technology will go forwards

1009
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,260
can I just add a little plug here I mean

1010
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:11,059
vaping is seen as like the future not

1011
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,220
just of the cannabis business but a lot

1012
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:15,860
of other medications a lot of other

1013
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:17,539
kinds of things right I mean yeah in

1014
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,519
theory it's possible yeah whatever can

1015
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:20,949
but cannabis is have a little bit

1016
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,480
special of because of this

1017
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:26,719
decarboxylation process THC a

1018
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:29,210
transformed into th see it there must be

1019
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,579
other substances still found what can be

1020
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:33,170
viable for it so what about the rest of

1021
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:34,730
you so and please you know introduce

1022

your firm quickly where do you see

1023
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,900
technology helping to revolutionize the

1024
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:40,429
business is it sales as tracking is it

1025
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,170
you know just knowing what you're doing

1026
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:43,940

1027
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,119
technology revolutionising the business

1028
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,119
end

1029
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:59,239
thank you

1030
00:49:56,269 --> 00:50:01,489
that works hi my name is Jeff Keene I'm

1031
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:03,919
the CEO of a company called or a product

1032
00:50:01,489 --> 00:50:06,409
called 365 cannabis but it's actually

1033
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,019
based on I'm a Microsoft dynamics

1034
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:10,879
platform an ERP platform so the way we

1035
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:13,219
feel we're gonna help revolutionize the

1036
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,170
space is actually taking something that

1037
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,759
works outside the industry and bring it

1038
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,079
in so we're looking at the cannabis

1039
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,700
industry like every other industry

1040
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,309
that's out there I think the cannabis

1041
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:24,169
industry in markets like Canada and in

1042
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:26,239
the u.s. started out thinking it was

1043
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,220
unique in every sense but from a

1044
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,229
business process since it's like a lot

1045
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:33,250
of other business it's Agri its food

1046
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:35,960
process manufacturing its distribution

1047
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,639
warehousing and in the US and now

1048
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,650
starting to be in Canada is also its

1049
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:42,379
retail so rather than look at it and say

1050
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:44,300
how do I solve my problems in cannabis

1051
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,680
for those things we're bringing a

1052
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,390
platform from outside that does all

1053
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,549
those things and applying it to the

1054
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:51,500
cannabis space and then this term seed

1055
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,990
to sale that comes out there in the US

1056
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,519
and Canada where you're compliant if you

1057
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:57,229
do all the right business processes and

1058
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,639
you set the system up properly then

1059
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:02,150
you're automatically going to be

1060
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:04,400
compliant and you your seed to sale that

1061
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,170
you hear so often in US the US and

1062
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,389
Canada

1063
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:10,490
anybody else have some feedback here

1064
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:12,199
yeah absolutely so hey hello everyone my

1065
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:14,739
name is Aida Sethi on the CEO founder

1066
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:16,909
groomers consulting the way that

1067
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:18,379
technology has actually revolutionized

1068
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:20,509
the industry in my eyes is that it's

1069
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,910
helped us scale this helps us automate

1070
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:24,230
it's helped us accelerate

1071
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:26,509
personally for me you know I I'm

1072
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,369
launching a software called Odyssey it's

1073
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:31,220
focused on licensing and permitting for

1074
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:33,259
cannabis businesses in the US and it's

1075
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:35,449
it's really accelerated and scale the

1076
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,430
process of being able to do that even

1077
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:39,469
though we can't fully automate it and I

1078
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:42,379
think that you can equate to you could

1079
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:44,569
equate it to something like you know the

1080
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,579
turbo tax or LegalZoom of the cannabis

1081
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:48,950
industry and it's focused on a lot of

1082
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:50,360
the pre-license aspects of getting these

1083
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:52,159
entrepreneurs licensed getting them up

1084
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,690
and running but I've seen everything in

1085
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,750
my 25 years of doing this I've seen

1086
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,900
everything from you know just these the

1087
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,789
CD sale tracking him

1088
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:04,200
control systems all the way to like

1089
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:06,900
robots AI drones inside cultivation

1090
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:10,649
facilities that are spotting things like

1091
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:12,660
disease pests and controlling these and

1092
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:14,700
automating it and so we're gonna see the

1093
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:17,369
same thing when it comes down to drop

1094
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:18,750
shipping medic medication eventually so

1095
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,730
it's really interesting to see how

1096
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:23,369
technology is really taking this to the

1097
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:26,039
next level and I can't wait we're really

1098
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:27,900
excited to see that so I'm going to jump

1099
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:29,579
here a second so you see and I agree

1100
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:33,480
with you technology is helping to

1101
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:35,519
normalize as well as automate routine

1102
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,789
processes that have also in part slowed

1103
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,980
down this industry is absolutely and we

1104
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:42,809
have yet to see some of the best out

1105
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,400
there I mean as we go through this

1106
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:47,400
innovation period it's almost like a

1107
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,590
Renaissance period of Technology we're

1108
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,059
seeing more and more and more come out

1109
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,829
every single day and everybody's just

1110
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:55,400
really taking it to the next level so

1111
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:55,400
it's really exciting

1112
00:52:55,429 --> 00:53:00,509
so hello my name is many I'm the chief

1113
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:03,209
product officer and interim CEO of

1114
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:05,970
namaste technologies we're a Canadian

1115
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:08,099
company were fully vertically integrated

1116
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:10,199
ecommerce platform in Canada

1117
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:12,989
specifically we have sales only licensed

1118
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,909
which essentially forces us to be a pure

1119
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:17,539
play a technology pure play company we

1120
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:19,529
leverage technology to enable

1121
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:22,460
optimization of the user experience and

1122
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:24,720
we deliver solutions such as education

1123
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,519
telemedicine applications the ability to

1124
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:27,179
purchase cannabis online same-day

1125
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,000
delivery

1126
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:32,789
journaling etc and we can talk about

1127
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,690
each one of these technologies or siloed

1128
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:38,309
assets separately but my bias is and

1129
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,230
it's gonna be very hyped is around that

1130
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:42,449
artificial intelligence and one of the

1131
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:45,329
things that were focused on is to try

1132
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:47,939
and understand how we can leverage AI to

1133
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:49,110
help people find the right product for

1134
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,480
them and actually brought one of our

1135
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:53,820
lead machine learning engineers with me

1136
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,159
so that everybody can harass him and see

1137
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,230
I'm not just making stuff up but that

1138
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:00,029
those just like the FinTech

1139
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,490
industry was really changed where you

1140
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:03,840
had people who were very very passionate

1141
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,279
but we're doing an understanding

1142
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,800
regulation and using technology to

1143
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,630
change that industry and we still see

1144
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,330
that impact since 2009 till today

1145
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:15,059
FinTech is still changing literally

1146
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:17,309
we're in the infancy days of technology

1147
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:18,840
and cannabis combined so so anyway I

1148
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:20,009
mean medpay for those who don't know

1149
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,120
what it is it's not many feet of

1150
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,190
advertisement you can come to our booth

1151
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,659
what we were using blockchain and we're

1152
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,250
actually I mean no matter what the

1153
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:28,230
technology is I think here whether it's

1154
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,510
hardware or software there are ways to

1155
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:32,760
use existing technology to automate

1156
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:35,430
processes there are ways to use new

1157
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,410
technology to push the envelope there's

1158
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:38,669
a whole bunch of innovation that's

1159
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:40,619
coming out but one of the things also

1160
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,570
that struck me about this panel was how

1161
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,859
international it is right so you have

1162
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:46,140
people here with international

1163
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:49,950
experience and technology certainly

1164
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:51,719
across oceans is different and a lot of

1165
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:54,359
us are looking at the compliance space

1166
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:56,819
one way or another how about just shout

1167
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,220
out where are where do you think the

1168
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,620
international cannabis industry in some

1169
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:04,019
ways has started to reform or put

1170
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:05,460
pressure on or change the cannabis

1171
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:07,349
industry in other places and how does

1172
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,800
this get Mistry now being international

1173
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:12,509
play into the revolution and

1174
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,840
revolutionising idea of tech in its

1175
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:18,210
application where do you see that happen

1176
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:20,789
yeah I am we have to the last four of

1177
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,559
months we distributed into 19 countries

1178
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:24,210
around the world so it's very

1179
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,489
international and it's everywhere

1180
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,470
available and of course with this

1181
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:31,139
technology you have tend the way how you

1182
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:35,219
can consume cannabis in a medical way

1183
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:38,219
you have 10 an episode you can track all

1184
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:40,889
that and so it's the technology is

1185
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:44,549
really a nowadays distributed worldwide

1186
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:46,019
in a very fast way but its comply is

1187
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,240
different from country to country right

1188
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:50,730
yeah exactly and of course we are

1189
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,769
European country we are here a medical

1190
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,409
device manufacturer on a medical device

1191
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:57,869
manufacturer means that he needs to be

1192
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:59,819
have a quality management system

1193
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:01,710
yeah it's called traceability what is

1194
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,900
called see to sail on the other hand on

1195
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:07,050
a device and destroys ability if you get

1196
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,820
back defective device which is a very

1197
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:11,220
number you must be able to track back

1198
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,789
but you purchased every single part you

1199
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:16,799
built in and where you have it so - so

1200
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:18,869
there the requirements are relatively

1201
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,789
high and they are different from country

1202
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:22,589
to country for example we don't have a

1203
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:24,000
medical device in the USA because the

1204
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:26,039
FDA is not ready to

1205
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,949
a medical device then if you go to

1206
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:31,110
Israel you have of course also other

1207
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:33,259
requirements labeling in Hebrew in

1208
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:37,170
Arabic can also little bit challenging

1209
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:39,590
stuff like that and the latest compliant

1210
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:44,159
thing we got is the gdpr

1211
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:47,100
the channel directly from the escape or

1212
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:50,849
downs which control no privacy yeah yeah

1213
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:52,769
privacy laws so this gives you also an

1214
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:55,860
answer compliance seeing what I think

1215
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:59,280
from people from North America they are

1216
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:02,370
not ready for the GDP I as far as I can

1217
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,680
as I can see of course the law it's less

1218
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:07,980
than a year old but it's a really a it's

1219
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:10,169
a strict law and it's a really highly

1220
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,240
punished law and it will be followed it

1221
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:14,730
so I think it will also affect a lot of

1222
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,709
people who touch Europe in any in any

1223
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:20,849
way these their products there's some

1224
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:22,260
compliance coming up I'll take the next

1225
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:24,539
one kits an interesting question on

1226
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,820
compliance because so we do business in

1227
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:28,469
Canada US and there's a number of

1228
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,620
international companies in Colombia

1229
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:32,669
Jamaica Australia Denmark that we're

1230
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:34,319
dealing with right now in the cannabis

1231
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:36,210
industry but the platform is already

1232
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,039
international so if you look at the

1233
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,079
platform work we're using for ERP is

1234
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:42,059
already almost in every country in the

1235
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,549
world including Germany just not in in

1236
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:46,679
the cannabis space so the Canadians when

1237
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:48,600
they came into the space with their LPS

1238
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:51,210
and we came in a few years afterwards we

1239
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,889
saw the legacy of this was they their

1240
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:54,900
compliance to them was just in my

1241
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:56,339
complaint to Health Canada and I'm

1242
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,050
meeting the regulations so I can keep my

1243
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,840
license and they didn't think about

1244
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:02,130
compliance in any other way so now all

1245
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,800
of a sudden the Canadians are coming to

1246
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,690
us and asking us for GMP first of all I

1247
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,550
think they probably had to look up the

1248
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,619
the acronym as most of us do good

1249
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:12,570
manufacturing process which in order to

1250
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:14,519
export your product from Canada to

1251
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:17,519
countries like Germany you have to prove

1252
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:19,320
that you are a GMP processing facility

1253
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,630
and the Canadians weren't thinking of

1254
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,000
that at all so it's I think in some ways

1255
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:25,890
the international space has a way to

1256
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,530
benefit from what was already learned in

1257
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:30,659
the US and Canada not do the same things

1258
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:33,300
look at it as a business that has to be

1259
00:58:30,659 --> 00:58:35,699
compliant as a versus a compliant

1260
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,140
industry specific to cannabis that has

1261
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:40,710
to run a business and there's

1262
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:42,599
everywhere gdpr GMP FDA requirements are

1263
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:44,190
not in the US yet but they're coming so

1264
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:46,259
all these things have to be in place

1265
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,730
they're public companies now trading so

1266
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,070
now Sox compliance and how your

1267
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:52,230
financial reporting goes so we actually

1268
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,340
had to employ which I didn't think I'd

1269
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,440
ever have to do running a software

1270
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,990
company as higher compliance chief

1271
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,360
officer just for us to handle not only

1272
00:58:57,989 --> 00:59:01,500
what's going on in cannabis but also the

1273
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,150
compliance is coming at us from

1274
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,889
everywhere else I'm gonna push this one

1275
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:06,660
to you right so that's a discussion

1276
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:08,789
about what can technology do to

1277
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:11,069
revolution revolutionize the industry I

1278
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:12,480
think sales and advertising is certainly

1279
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:14,010
there right

1280
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,809
however controversial and I wanted to

1281
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,850
throw it in that direction because you

1282
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:20,460
know the question is about how

1283
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:22,139
technology can be applied to overcome

1284
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,559
some of the bigger issues whether it's

1285
00:59:22,139 --> 00:59:27,480
compliance or laws or etc and certainly

1286
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,599
sales online the discussion of the

1287
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,039
industry press online 2014 helped push

1288
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:33,690
forward a whole bunch of things how do

1289
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:35,699
you see this working how do you see this

1290
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:38,039
technology discussion changing

1291
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:39,419
regulatory frameworks that are still

1292
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:42,269
holding the industry back like

1293
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,170
advertising or etc so so that's a very

1294
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:46,289
important point to remember that

1295
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:49,110
everybody's very afraid of compliance

1296
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:50,279
gdpr and they're very worried about what

1297
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,960
are we gonna do with it but essentially

1298
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,210
if you look at it it could be a huge

1299
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,240
opportunity because the existence of

1300
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:59,730
gdpr raises the bar and allows you if

1301
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:02,099
you build systems in place to comply

1302
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:05,400
with that allows you to create moats

1303
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:07,230
around your business so for example part

1304
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,090
of gdpr and I'll get to the advertising

1305
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:11,699
sales point a moment part of GDP RS is

1306
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:13,620
security by design or segregating data

1307
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:16,199
not collecting data that you shouldn't

1308
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:17,940
if you don't need it for true processing

1309
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:19,980
so for example one of the things with

1310
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:22,230
automatic processing of data is that

1311
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,760
it's not exposed to humans so you can

1312
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:25,619
segregate it within the system and then

1313
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,570
you're protected from a compliance

1314
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:29,849
perspective you can automate a lot of

1315
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:31,200
the requirements that gdpr has and then

1316
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:32,789
you create those modes around the

1317
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,369
business and and you use that as an

1318
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:36,599
opportunity specifically around sales

1319
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:38,309
and marketing that's really interesting

1320
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,670
because I spent the morning talking with

1321
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:43,590
a lot of CB d producers and suppliers

1322
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:45,659
here and the one thing that everybody

1323
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:48,300
spoke about is like we cannot advertise

1324
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:49,920
we cannot sell our our products online

1325
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,030
or so we've not advertised a product so

1326
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,280
now even there was a pan

1327
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:57,180
previously that spoke about the exact

1328
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:59,519
same point and CBD let's take it as an

1329
01:00:57,179 --> 01:01:01,739
example in many countries many countries

1330
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,420
is completely mingle however the big

1331
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:06,659
advertising networks like Google and

1332
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:09,360
Facebook adsense double-click etc those

1333
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:11,069
are the ones that don't allow you to

1334
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:14,730
advertise and guess what happened to

1335
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:15,870
Google on GDP or in France discussion so

1336
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,880
I just want to come back to you though

1337
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:20,429
cuz I think your system actually helps

1338
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,559
people comply by automating it literally

1339
01:01:20,429 --> 01:01:24,509
by using the legal form so you're kind

1340
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,889
of combining those two do you want to

1341
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,960
talk a little bit about that yeah sure I

1342
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:29,579
mean you know just as you were stating

1343
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,380
about you know the different countries

1344
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:32,759
to have different laws or they're just

1345
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,400
coming online or becoming aware and

1346
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,200
educated just in the state of California

1347
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,240
alone it's like that it's like the whole

1348
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,219
world are all worlds policies in one

1349
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:43,649
state so as we go from city to county to

1350
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:44,879
the state level it's all different just

1351
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:47,309
like you go throughout the United States

1352
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,829
it's all different so we've had to find

1353
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:52,559
a way to kind of jump that based on best

1354
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:54,539
practices we know that the FDA is gonna

1355
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,579
step in eventually just like you have

1356
01:01:54,539 --> 01:01:58,679
you should always be focused on good

1357
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,900
manufacturing practices or good business

1358
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:03,029
practices that's a very important factor

1359
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:04,950
when you're coming in and exporting to

1360
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:06,810
the EU as well because if you're not

1361
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:08,939
compliant then you're not going to be

1362
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:10,469
able to serve that market I think that

1363
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,940
uh when it comes down to it when it

1364
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:13,369
comes down to technology let me ask for

1365
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,440
a quick how many people in this room

1366
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:19,259
right now are in a start-up mode for a

1367
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,659
tech company or in a tech company right

1368
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:24,810
now how many people anybody great

1369
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:26,849
awesome so we are not limited as what

1370
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:28,920
I'm saying with technology you can

1371
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:30,360
license that technology you can take

1372
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,909
that technology to other countries

1373
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:36,269
you're not limited like cannabis is

1374
01:02:32,909 --> 01:02:38,190
limited and for the fact that we are you

1375
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:41,009
know a technology firm or able to

1376
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:42,329
actually serve more markets than our

1377
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,920
counterparts who are in the cannabis

1378
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:46,409
industry trying to get license to sell

1379
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,610
cannabis and that's that's the the thing

1380
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:48,989
that we always need to compare that to

1381
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:51,150
in my opinion you said license the

1382
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:53,369
technology to others is AWS right AWS

1383
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:54,539
started as an internal solution for

1384
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,849
Amazon because they couldn't find

1385
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:58,289
something that met their needs and now

1386
01:02:56,849 --> 01:03:00,179
it grew to a ten billion dollar a year

1387
01:02:58,289 --> 01:03:02,070
business because they every who here

1388
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:03,268
doesn't you or uses AWS in their

1389
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,469
business right so

1390
01:03:03,268 --> 01:03:07,288
I think so I think we can all agree

1391
01:03:04,469 --> 01:03:08,849
right that in some ways technology is

1392
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:10,649
revolutionizing the industry because

1393
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:12,149
it's normalizing it it's saying this is

1394
01:03:10,648 --> 01:03:13,918
just a commodity or it's such our soap

1395
01:03:12,148 --> 01:03:16,139
but as a way of a lead-in I saw a lot of

1396
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:18,298
hands go up there are a lot of people in

1397
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:22,018
startups and we would like to now open

1398
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:23,518
the you know the field for questions so

1399
01:03:22,018 --> 01:03:25,858
if you have questions please go ahead

1400
01:03:23,518 --> 01:03:26,728
and bounce them back to us because one

1401
01:03:25,858 --> 01:03:29,308
of the things we were talking about

1402
01:03:26,728 --> 01:03:30,568
before we came on here is I think I'm

1403
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:32,399
one of the few people actually who's

1404
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:35,308
gone through the German incue bation

1405
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:36,838
system there are opportunities if you

1406
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:38,640
are starting to look at applying

1407
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:40,918
technology and want to apply technology

1408
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:43,048
in this revolutionary business where you

1409
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:45,328
can start to enter the market in new and

1410
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:47,038
different ways in part by normalizing

1411
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:48,899
that in part by saying I'm not just

1412
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,449
dealing with cannabis as this crazy

1413
01:03:48,898 --> 01:03:53,608
plant I'm dealing with a narcotic that

1414
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:56,130
has to be that's an off-label drug that

1415
01:03:53,608 --> 01:03:59,308
has to be approved or etc or I have to

1416
01:03:56,130 --> 01:04:01,289
track plant for debt data so I think how

1417
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:02,519
would you say that and and you're gonna

1418
01:04:01,289 --> 01:04:06,929
I'm gonna pick on you again how would

1419
01:04:02,518 --> 01:04:09,868
you say that technology has changed the

1420
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:11,398
equation in terms of normalization if

1421
01:04:09,869 --> 01:04:13,499
that makes anything for example you have

1422
01:04:11,398 --> 01:04:15,509
to get you have to go through insurance

1423
01:04:13,498 --> 01:04:17,458
approvals there's a medical equipment

1424
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:19,588
provider you're the only person on stage

1425
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:21,629
has to go through that so technology is

1426
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:24,018
also adding a different level of

1427
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:27,869
compliance to you as well is that

1428
01:04:24,018 --> 01:04:29,458
revolutionary to you for example yeah as

1429
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:30,809
a medical device manufacturer of course

1430
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:32,668
there are out there are a lot of medical

1431
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:34,259
devices so it's not so important if it

1432
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,638
is for cannabis or for something else

1433
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:37,079
you need to follow the medical device

1434
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:39,119
rules and they are there and if you

1435
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:42,839
comply you comply and there's no reason

1436
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:45,119
then to decline any allowance to it on

1437
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:46,438
the insurance idea we have tried to get

1438
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,019
here in Germany

1439
01:04:46,438 --> 01:04:51,778
generate recovers to get on there is a

1440
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:53,908
list hits metallicity ever you can get

1441
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:55,409
on then you get a tender doctor can

1442
01:04:53,909 --> 01:04:58,048
prescribe it and the patient get it

1443
01:04:55,409 --> 01:05:00,148
reimbursed but unfortunately we have not

1444
01:04:58,048 --> 01:05:02,880
reached to get on this list yet there

1445
01:05:00,148 --> 01:05:04,558
are still too many hurdles and they are

1446
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,439
still unsure and they fear that they are

1447
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,969
get a lot of prescription for it but on

1448
01:05:07,438 --> 01:05:11,398
there we are working for and hopefully

1449
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:13,469
soon we will we will have to yeah and at

1450
01:05:11,398 --> 01:05:16,048
least we can work together on that

1451
01:05:13,469 --> 01:05:17,070
question so any of it I think for

1452
01:05:16,048 --> 01:05:18,480
example

1453
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:21,380
you for example are actually in a

1454
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,820
licensing and processing approval

1455
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:25,590
discussion correct yes correct I mean

1456
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:28,410
you know essentially again it comes back

1457
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:31,140
to their regulations at the state level

1458
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:33,149
in the US in this case in in Germany or

1459
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,190
other areas if they were to do licensing

1460
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:37,440
it would be I think that obviously the

1461
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:39,570
government levels so we what we do is we

1462
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,070
sort of analyze when when regulations

1463
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:43,019
come out you know regulations are

1464
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,850
shifting and changing theirs is dynamic

1465
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:46,349
compliance I like to call it really

1466
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:49,259
because everything this whole space is

1467
01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:50,909
very dynamic so when it comes down to it

1468
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:52,650
we have to really navigate these

1469
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:54,869
processes but if we can accelerate it

1470
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:56,099
and lower the barrier of entry and put

1471
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,900
you know promote more diversity and

1472
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:59,190
bring more players into this game you

1473
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,500
know and really get it to the point

1474
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:03,960
where folks can really innovate we are

1475
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:07,170
gonna see a hyper jump in that space in

1476
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,360
terms of technology in terms of how you

1477
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:12,119
know folks actually operate and so we

1478
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:13,440
want to ensure that first that you guys

1479
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,359
get permitted and regulated and

1480
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,250
regulated and licensed and then there's

1481
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,360
ongoing compliance partners that handle

1482
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,219
everything else because everybody's

1483
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,809
focused on that section as opposed to

1484
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:24,059
the pre licensed section so that's where

1485
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:26,250
our focus is but again coming back to

1486
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,750
technology and how it's changing the

1487
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,429
face of the landscape there's things

1488
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:32,820
like the Internet of Things for instance

1489
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:34,769
IOT where we're seeing IOT manage like

1490
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,850
how the plants growing you know check

1491
01:06:34,769 --> 01:06:38,070
you just know there's like full

1492
01:06:35,849 --> 01:06:39,690
automation on this right and so as a

1493
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:41,490
business owner that's trying to scale

1494
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:43,500
and serve a high demand in this

1495
01:06:41,489 --> 01:06:45,959
marketplace things like that are pretty

1496
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,070
important I mean it lowers the the cost

1497
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,990
associated with it we're able to really

1498
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:54,269
magnify the ability to grow this plant

1499
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:56,339
exactly the same way over and over again

1500
01:06:54,269 --> 01:06:58,440
which is consistency so we have a

1501
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:00,180
fracture supply chain now on the global

1502
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,320
level but you know just the base of the

1503
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:03,690
US or just based on the state of

1504
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:06,960
California it's still a fractured supply

1505
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:09,210
chain so we're not able to get the same

1506
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,130
consistency of products because

1507
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:14,429
businesses are scaling and this is a

1508
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:16,200
plant that changes it's it's you know

1509
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:18,239
it's consistency over the course of time

1510
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,989
as you scale it or add nutrients or add

1511
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:20,039
different lighting

1512
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:21,779
all right different management

1513
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:23,000
techniques on the planet so it's really

1514
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:26,100
interesting to see how technology

1515
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,440
shaping that but most importantly is

1516
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:29,969
that just innovation is gonna this isn't

1517
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,440
never stop it's gonna happen over

1518
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:33,750
and over again just like with the

1519
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,849
internet when it first came out so I

1520
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:38,070
like to compare to that because that's

1521
01:07:35,849 --> 01:07:40,080
how fast this thing is moving right and

1522
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:42,240
so I would HIGHLY highly recommend

1523
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,469
taking advantage of that absolutely so

1524
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:44,969
so I'm gonna throw this out is there

1525
01:07:43,469 --> 01:07:47,098
anybody with questions right now who

1526
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:48,169
wants to ask the panel anything where

1527
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:51,180
can we keep going

1528
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:52,800
okay I'm sorry do you know I think you

1529
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:55,799
had a specific issue that you wanted to

1530
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:57,060
bring up in terms of I think that you

1531
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,800
were sort of talking about the fact that

1532
01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:01,469
two toward take it to the next level

1533
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:04,410
that of all of us in some ways from a

1534
01:08:01,469 --> 01:08:06,569
technology panel or technology solution

1535
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:08,579
but just I just generally lessons

1536
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:10,260
learned right come in contact Lee coming

1537
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:12,000
coming coming with it from a platform

1538
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,890
that already works in other industries

1539
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,510
and coming into the cannabis space into

1540
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,909
North America first of all the

1541
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:19,109
international space has a

1542
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:21,539
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set

1543
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:22,890
their business up from the ground up not

1544
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:24,509
only because cannabis is new but the

1545
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,829
businesses are new and setting it up the

1546
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:28,890
right way with technology and making

1547
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:30,778
some of the right decisions most most US

1548
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:33,359
companies that are in the space have

1549
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:35,400
probably gone through two three four

1550
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,048
different iterations of solutions

1551
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:39,059
whatever they tried in the beginning

1552
01:08:37,048 --> 01:08:40,949
didn't work they're now on to you know

1553
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:42,029
multiple others and and from our

1554
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:44,519
standpoint this is where we're now

1555
01:08:42,029 --> 01:08:47,009
coming in from the outside saying you're

1556
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,020
in agriculture you grow in greenhouses

1557
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:51,329
people have been growing in greenhouses

1558
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:53,069
for decades hundreds of years and

1559
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:54,960
there's already software out there that

1560
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:56,910
does that for you so why are you trying

1561
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,009
to apply brand new software to something

1562
01:08:56,909 --> 01:09:00,059
that's already established out there so

1563
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,380
we're kind of coming at it from a

1564
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,690
different way saying you're in supply

1565
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,239
chain management that does agriculture

1566
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:08,369
that does food process manufacturing

1567
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:10,379
distribution and potentially retail so

1568
01:09:08,369 --> 01:09:11,759
for us we're not looking at it having to

1569
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,289
introduce something brand new because

1570
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,719
the space requires it we're trying to

1571
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:16,979
normalize it by saying it already exists

1572
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:18,600
out there don't go make the same

1573
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:20,129
mistakes that the others did where

1574
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,440
you're buying software from the ground

1575
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:23,609
up that isn't proven anywhere yet but

1576
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:24,809
just trying to find itself in the

1577
01:09:23,609 --> 01:09:27,180
cannabis base because it's going to get

1578
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:28,830
out scaled as you normalize the business

1579
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,960
out there all those other things start

1580
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:32,759
to hit you the normal business processes

1581
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,079
that every other business runs in and

1582
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,329
the end you're you're here to make money

1583
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,219
on these businesses it's not just about

1584
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:39,960
you're in the cannabis industry and what

1585
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:41,250
software will work for that well see and

1586
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,078
and and this is where I'm hoping to

1587
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,639
introduce a little bit of

1588
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:46,009
you know controversy here so you know

1589
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:48,020
obviously your bed pays using a new

1590
01:09:46,009 --> 01:09:50,328
technology called blockchain right and

1591
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:53,000
how do you integrate that into a new

1592
01:09:50,328 --> 01:09:54,349
industry while minimizing risks and

1593
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,760
attacking the issues that you're

1594
01:09:54,349 --> 01:09:57,529
attacking well one of the ways that

1595
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,449
we've decided to go forward on this is

1596
01:09:57,529 --> 01:10:01,189
actually blending this so we're holding

1597
01:09:59,448 --> 01:10:02,988
workshops where we're bringing

1598
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:05,178
stakeholders together who aren't

1599
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:06,948
necessarily tech geeks but they're

1600
01:10:05,179 --> 01:10:08,480
business people with problems and

1601
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:10,279
they're coming together and they're

1602
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:13,250
discussing them and that is how we're

1603
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:15,109
starting to I think also start to pin

1604
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,090
new technology processes and

1605
01:10:15,109 --> 01:10:19,969
re-engineering into a new business which

1606
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:22,730
it very much is here as much as we are

1607
01:10:19,969 --> 01:10:25,520
I guess re-engineering processes so I

1608
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:28,098
think that this for us the Cannabis of

1609
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,530
vertical has given us a way to address a

1610
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:33,440
larger problem that is faced for example

1611
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:35,198
by the chronically ill people who need

1612
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,578
to get expensive medical equipment

1613
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:39,198
pharmacies people who are touching this

1614
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:41,299
ecosystem but didn't necessarily have

1615
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:42,618
another way to touch it but but I'm

1616
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,820
gonna throw something also up here

1617
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:47,210
because everyone's talking about this

1618
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:49,308
the whole enabling ash aspect or not

1619
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,630
enabling aspect especially when you

1620
01:10:49,309 --> 01:10:53,449
throw in privacy and all the other

1621
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:55,849
issues about online sales right because

1622
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:58,539
online discussion about this industry I

1623
01:10:55,849 --> 01:11:00,739
think has very much lead to greater

1624
01:10:58,539 --> 01:11:02,389
legalization as much as governments have

1625
01:11:00,738 --> 01:11:04,848
not maybe gotten the regulation right so

1626
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:06,980
far but clearly I think the online

1627
01:11:04,849 --> 01:11:08,360
discussion and Technology does lead to

1628
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:12,308
online sales would any what do you like

1629
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:16,098
to take a and dive into that as and also

1630
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:17,770
from the enabling and also the privacy

1631
01:11:16,099 --> 01:11:20,539
perspective

1632
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:22,699
yeah I can talk about the online aspect

1633
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:25,368
of it I mean it the at the end of the

1634
01:11:22,698 --> 01:11:27,078
day that's where the industry or all

1635
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:30,019
businesses are going to write because as

1636
01:11:27,078 --> 01:11:32,840
humans we are lazy we want the path of

1637
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:34,670
least resistance so if I'm able to sit

1638
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,460
at home and if we look at the full stack

1639
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:39,590
of the cannabis industry if I'm able to

1640
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:43,368
get a prescription without leaving my

1641
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:45,050
house and then buy a volcano without

1642
01:11:43,368 --> 01:11:48,319
leaving my house and have it delivered I

1643
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:49,909
will likely prefer it over having to

1644
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:52,519
leave get in my car drive through snow

1645
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:56,138
see a doctor and go to a pharmacy pick

1646
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:58,790
up the product etc so from in regards to

1647
01:11:56,139 --> 01:12:00,050
ecommerce right obviously I'm quite

1648
01:11:58,789 --> 01:12:02,359
biased so I can continue talking about

1649
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:06,320
that aspect for for a while but it is

1650
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:07,848
something that is driving this industry

1651
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,920
forward well let me let me be a devil

1652
01:12:07,849 --> 01:12:11,239
advocate is it isn't ecommerce or is it

1653
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,679
telemedicine I mean I think that there

1654
01:12:11,238 --> 01:12:14,839
are two aspects of this is the

1655
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:17,750
telemedicine there's the e-commerce

1656
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,150
there's the do people feel comfortable

1657
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,889
not seeing a doctor our regulatory

1658
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:23,388
agencies in particular when you get into

1659
01:12:21,889 --> 01:12:25,039
the narcotics side of this is gonna say

1660
01:12:23,389 --> 01:12:25,940
yeah the years of schedule to you and

1661
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,729
you don't have to come and see a doctor

1662
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:34,399
anymore is that realistic Germany you're

1663
01:12:28,729 --> 01:12:36,019
gonna today I read that you can get then

1664
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:38,299
you can get online to a doctor and you

1665
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:41,090
can claim to be ill for your business

1666
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,079
and yeah this is a new system who is

1667
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,760
available to you but it's very

1668
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:47,139
controversial the doctor doesn't get

1669
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:51,380
paid yet by the way there's some issues

1670
01:12:47,139 --> 01:12:52,609
yeah maybe and as a general remark about

1671
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:55,368
compliance because it was here about

1672
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:56,719
fearing compliance or I I think it's

1673
01:12:55,368 --> 01:12:59,210
very important to be compliant that

1674
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,789
saying I think every managing director

1675
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:04,670
CEO must take care to be compliance and

1676
01:13:01,789 --> 01:13:06,469
especially in this field because on the

1677
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:07,969
one hand you don't want to get extra

1678
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:09,800
hurdles because you are treating

1679
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:11,420
something with cannabis but on the

1680
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,489
younger on the other hand you order do

1681
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,929
not want to get to be very favorite

1682
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:16,698
because it's gonna have a sensing you

1683
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:18,618
can you don't need to be compliant

1684
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:19,969
because it's cannabis both sites you

1685
01:13:18,618 --> 01:13:21,979
don't want to see you want to see you

1686
01:13:19,969 --> 01:13:25,908
don't want to get extra hurdles but you

1687
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:29,809
also want not to get any easy way on

1688
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:30,948
some angle let's move your bit being on

1689
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,960
the compliance because I think

1690
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:35,448
technology can also you be used for

1691
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:38,510
research right and and sort of the big

1692
01:13:35,448 --> 01:13:40,729
data data gathering aspects I think of

1693
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:41,719
basically all of what we've decided I

1694
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:43,759
mean I think what's interesting about

1695
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:45,198
you guys is you're moving I mean more

1696
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,820
and more into a world where you can

1697
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:48,829
gather information online for example

1698
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:51,139
through the bait I was soon right I

1699
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:52,670
don't want to say but but regardless I

1700
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:54,319
mean there's there's definitely this

1701
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:56,989
whole discussion now about digital

1702
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,539
health in the cloud and privacy issues

1703
01:13:56,988 --> 01:14:04,069
how would you I don't it touch on that

1704
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:05,269
one yeah we we actually built let's some

1705
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:07,189
were the problem right the problem is

1706
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:08,540
that a lot of people use cannabis but

1707
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:09,649
there is no way for them to actually

1708
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:12,649
measure if it's helping

1709
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:13,670
them or not so there are not a lot but

1710
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:15,920
quite a few companies that build

1711
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:17,390
solutions to address that we are one of

1712
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,170
them there's a great company that that

1713
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,789
is out here today

1714
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:22,520
strain print that does the same thing

1715
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:25,909
and essentially allows people to track

1716
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:28,040
usage and the impact of products on

1717
01:14:25,909 --> 01:14:29,269
their symptoms and initially at least

1718
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:30,949
that's when we release this we're like

1719
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:33,410
no one's ever gonna give us any data and

1720
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:35,389
we were very surprised to see that

1721
01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:37,159
actually people were very forthcoming

1722
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:38,900
they weren't Germans that were they

1723
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:40,460
right no there might be driven right but

1724
01:14:38,899 --> 01:14:42,109
the people who have very very

1725
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:45,020
forthcoming with the data because there

1726
01:14:42,109 --> 01:14:48,500
was a lot of value that was created in

1727
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:50,150
exchange for that date too so that's

1728
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,619
something that is is actually moving

1729
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:55,149
forward in the idea of being able to

1730
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:58,279
collect real data from real people and

1731
01:14:55,149 --> 01:15:00,559
analyze it and generate insights has

1732
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:02,509
value across the entire list you want

1733
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,130
for patients for example or able to

1734
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,869
recommend what strains are right or

1735
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:09,829
wrong for them for the industry were

1736
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:11,689
able to help growers understand what's

1737
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:13,430
popular what they need to grow because

1738
01:15:11,689 --> 01:15:15,649
of growth cycles for device

1739
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:17,690
manufacturers they can understand what

1740
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:19,759
temperature's people are using is it

1741
01:15:17,689 --> 01:15:22,879
conduction convection based what are the

1742
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,039
most popular models etc there is so many

1743
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,720
different elements that can be used that

1744
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:30,019
are valuable for both parts of the

1745
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:31,550
industry so it's something SOLAS we're

1746
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,960
training abilities so hands up how many

1747
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,449
people involved here in the startup side

1748
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:39,079
are using technology in education hands

1749
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:43,399
up how many how many are using it in

1750
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:47,119
compliance how many are using it for

1751
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:48,739
medical processing okay anybody else who

1752
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,630
wants to speak up I mean we really are

1753
01:15:48,739 --> 01:15:52,639
trying to encourage technology companies

1754
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:54,319
to come forward and talk about their

1755
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,180
experiences because we can all learn

1756
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:59,479
from each other I mean I will say that

1757
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:01,130
my experience here has been actually to

1758
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:03,559
sort of use some of the stigma around

1759
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:06,680
this plant to actually get people to

1760
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,900
agree to start to use new technology for

1761
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,700
example I mean if people agree Lea this

1762
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:12,710
narcotic and yes we need to track it and

1763
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:14,869
no we can't really do this because gdpr

1764
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:16,489
says we can't follow this etc I think

1765
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:19,670
that that does also create a new

1766
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:22,760
opportunity to apply new technology in a

1767
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:24,890
new way to fix problems that are

1768
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,829
affecting this industry as it normalizes

1769
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:30,710
and potentially other pieces of a larger

1770
01:16:27,829 --> 01:16:32,710
vertical have any of you had experiences

1771
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:34,730
without that you would like to talk to

1772
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:36,859
actually I'd like to have come back to

1773
01:16:34,729 --> 01:16:39,469
you you know what you stated about how

1774
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:40,729
there's nothing new here guys I mean

1775
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,320
like at the end of the day the tech

1776
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:44,569
there's technology out there it's not

1777
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,939
about reinventing the wheel it's about

1778
01:16:44,569 --> 01:16:48,859
making that wheel way much better way

1779
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:50,210
better than what it is because here's

1780
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:51,949
the thing like the technology we

1781
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,600
developed it was really kind of out of

1782
01:16:51,949 --> 01:16:54,889
multiple different pieces we took the

1783
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,380
best of several different pieces of

1784
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:59,090
technology they worked in our field and

1785
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:01,550
infused it together into something

1786
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:02,989
that's brand spanking new right and the

1787
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,310
same thing goes for a lot of these

1788
01:17:02,989 --> 01:17:07,250
different factors it's like you don't

1789
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:09,320
need to create anything new even unless

1790
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:11,899
it's something that has to be created

1791
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:13,639
new so encourage you guys to look out

1792
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:15,439
there and see and do a lot of research

1793
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:17,150
because before you spend all this money

1794
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:19,099
or your investors money for that matter

1795
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:21,109
on a lot of different things that you

1796
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,820
that is already existing just do a lot

1797
01:17:21,109 --> 01:17:24,439
of research first because there's a lot

1798
01:17:22,819 --> 01:17:26,599
of things out there that already serve

1799
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:28,579
that purpose we were seeing a merge of

1800
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:31,039
all these different industries merged

1801
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:33,050
into the cannabis industry from all

1802
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,449
different fields that includes you know

1803
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:37,310
medicine that includes technology that

1804
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:38,869
includes agriculture that includes

1805
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,610
retail that includes supply chain

1806
01:17:38,869 --> 01:17:42,559
tracking that includes all different

1807
01:17:40,609 --> 01:17:44,299
logistics and transportation I mean

1808
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,190
there's so many different things happen

1809
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:47,449
globally that you're just gonna take

1810
01:17:46,189 --> 01:17:49,250
from all those different industries and

1811
01:17:47,449 --> 01:17:51,979
then apply your own kind of sort of

1812
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:53,329
style to it right and I also want to you

1813
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:55,489
know real quickly you know talk talk

1814
01:17:53,329 --> 01:17:57,470
about this hotel medicine aspect of this

1815
01:17:55,489 --> 01:18:00,079
or just working with patients and

1816
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:01,970
gathering that data you know I have a

1817
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,309
friend of mine his name's dr. Len May

1818
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:05,930
he's based on Los Angeles if he runs a

1819
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:08,240
company called endo Canon Health now

1820
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:11,030
what endo Kennett health does is they

1821
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:13,670
take your 23andme data and translate it

1822
01:18:11,029 --> 01:18:15,199
the information into what you need for

1823
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:17,359
you what would work best for you in

1824
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:19,130
terms of cannabis products right what

1825
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,630
would work worse for you in terms of

1826
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:22,460
causing stress or anxiety or different

1827
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:24,920
things like that really really cool

1828
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:27,949
technology but this way you're able to

1829
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,989
get highly targeted patient data that's

1830
01:18:27,949 --> 01:18:31,639
that's that's really amazing and so you

1831
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:33,409
know exactly what works for you because

1832
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,239
what will work for one person may not

1833
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:36,769
work for the other person right

1834
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:38,388
so it's really important to see that

1835
01:18:36,769 --> 01:18:40,099
it's pretty incredible and I'm gonna

1836
01:18:38,389 --> 01:18:42,618
jump into here I said so the difference

1837
01:18:40,099 --> 01:18:44,389
in privacy the approach to privacy from

1838
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:45,920
a technology perspective is a very very

1839
01:18:44,389 --> 01:18:48,139
different depending on where you are I

1840
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,019
mean if you're in California home of

1841
01:18:48,139 --> 01:18:52,248
Google and we don't care about privacy

1842
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:53,809
and I'm gonna say that because they've

1843
01:18:52,248 --> 01:18:55,698
just gotten a suit here and you're in in

1844
01:18:53,809 --> 01:18:57,710
France they don't and I you know I think

1845
01:18:55,698 --> 01:19:00,018
that there is a wide opportunity here

1846
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:02,269
but I think that that is one of the

1847
01:19:00,019 --> 01:19:03,769
issues that we see is that privacy and

1848
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:06,349
the understanding of what privacy is

1849
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:09,769
aware that data can go and who can have

1850
01:19:06,349 --> 01:19:11,748
access to that and why is a discussion

1851
01:19:09,769 --> 01:19:13,969
that I think the cannabis industry in

1852
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:15,920
general and patients and doctors should

1853
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:17,658
step up on I mean weird we're in that

1854
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,739
space we don't believe that private

1855
01:19:17,658 --> 01:19:20,868
companies should have as much

1856
01:19:18,738 --> 01:19:23,419
information about people as they do and

1857
01:19:20,868 --> 01:19:25,929
we see gdpr to your point I think as a

1858
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:28,908
way of setting a much higher standard

1859
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:30,710
where patients actually have control

1860
01:19:28,908 --> 01:19:32,899
what they don't and that in itself is

1861
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:33,980
something that we can enable with the

1862
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:36,259
use of technology

1863
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:37,848
while giving industry more information

1864
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:40,099
that they ever possibly could have hoped

1865
01:19:37,849 --> 01:19:41,538
for but it is completely anonymized

1866
01:19:40,099 --> 01:19:44,239
because of the way that we approach it

1867
01:19:41,538 --> 01:19:46,389
so maybe that is one of the ways to talk

1868
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:49,248
maybe we can talk about a bit about

1869
01:19:46,389 --> 01:19:51,440
privacy because I think this is a huge

1870
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:53,090
huge discussion that is not often talked

1871
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:55,129
about because people a gdpr doesn't

1872
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:58,159
matter it doesn't affect my business in

1873
01:19:55,130 --> 01:20:00,998
in Germany or in Europe right now at GDP

1874
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:05,960
our violation 1 GDP our violation they

1875
01:20:00,998 --> 01:20:07,279
continue 4% of global sales so if you

1876
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,868
think about just the cannabis

1877
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,479
perspective of this beyond the fact that

1878
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:13,729
private sea as a medical discussion

1879
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:15,618
should be baked in tin all of us this

1880
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:18,109
particularly can hurt a company has

1881
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:22,460
small medical sales here in Germany but

1882
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:23,839
a global footprint for example so how do

1883
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:25,698
you think that and I'm gonna I think

1884
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,889
maybe in this a little bit early because

1885
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:29,899
I want to speed things up and make sure

1886
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:33,380
this conference moves on but how do you

1887
01:20:29,899 --> 01:20:36,078
see technology influencing the privacy

1888
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:38,569
conversation and I would say if you want

1889
01:20:36,078 --> 01:20:40,908
to add in the cannabis industry fine but

1890
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:42,920
I think that technology can be used to

1891
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:45,170
highlight that so for example you're

1892
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,908
gonna you know are you making plans to

1893
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:49,069
give people their own personal cloud

1894
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:50,299
access for example or

1895
01:20:49,069 --> 01:20:52,009
you know in your industry are you

1896
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,810
thinking about the fact that yeah I've

1897
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:55,820
got a you know these are their privacy

1898
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:57,260
aspects on the on the on the b2b side

1899
01:20:55,819 --> 01:20:59,210
that maybe we haven't thought about I

1900
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,739
mean I think that is from my perspective

1901
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:02,000
meaning that is where I spend a lot of

1902
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:03,919
my time thinking and planning and

1903
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,849
working but I don't know I'm just jump

1904
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,560
in there because I mean what you just

1905
01:21:04,849 --> 01:21:09,409
said is so complex depending on where

1906
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,480
you are so we conduct business in the US

1907
01:21:09,408 --> 01:21:13,698
there's over 30 states that we're having

1908
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:17,868
to deal with if you know we deal with

1909
01:21:13,698 --> 01:21:19,729
Canada we the data that we take from our

1910
01:21:17,868 --> 01:21:21,380
customers is not our data it's that we

1911
01:21:19,729 --> 01:21:23,658
put it into Azure it's your environment

1912
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:25,400
in our model so the data is yours we

1913
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:27,649
just have to help you manage it and in

1914
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:30,948
Canada the data has to stay inside of

1915
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:32,629
Canada so you've to technology company

1916
01:21:30,948 --> 01:21:35,299
we have to put platforms up everywhere

1917
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:36,949
that comply to that requirement that

1918
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:38,570
really has nothing to do with cannabis

1919
01:21:36,948 --> 01:21:41,598
has more to do with with the data side

1920
01:21:38,569 --> 01:21:43,750
of it so privacy relates to the consumer

1921
01:21:41,599 --> 01:21:46,400
but it also relates to your data

1922
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:49,429
everybody's coming to us looking for

1923
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:50,598
aggregated data on your business not

1924
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:52,609
just from what you're selling to

1925
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:54,050
patients but you know what products are

1926
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:56,509
selling it every other industry has

1927
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:58,099
aggregated data that they're looking at

1928
01:21:56,510 --> 01:22:00,590
if you if you come from the hotel

1929
01:21:58,099 --> 01:22:02,060
industry every Hotel knows how busy this

1930
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:03,739
hotel was last night what the occupancy

1931
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:05,539
was here as it compares to everybody

1932
01:22:03,738 --> 01:22:07,129
else and what the average room rate was

1933
01:22:05,539 --> 01:22:09,578
and this industry needs to know the same

1934
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:11,750
thing what products should I be selling

1935
01:22:09,578 --> 01:22:13,368
how much how much does it cost me to

1936
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,479
produce that product how can it be more

1937
01:22:13,368 --> 01:22:16,908
efficient and you have to share the

1938
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:19,069
aggregated data as a community so that

1939
01:22:16,908 --> 01:22:20,328
we we can all get better at it so then

1940
01:22:19,069 --> 01:22:22,849
then there's the privacy of that

1941
01:22:20,328 --> 01:22:24,380
information so we we don't give that

1942
01:22:22,849 --> 01:22:25,909
data out that has to be you guys

1943
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:27,889
providing that data amongst yourselves

1944
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:30,948
and then a community setting itself up

1945
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:32,480
with that aggregated data gets used okay

1946
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:34,059
so I think we're being signaled from the

1947
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,888
side here that we're running out of time

1948
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:41,960
last call for any questions you can

1949
01:22:36,889 --> 01:22:45,590
catch us later there is good hi sulla

1950
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:49,099
Frank cleaver botanics conversation is

1951
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:53,360
very interesting because we launched our

1952
01:22:49,099 --> 01:22:56,349
online shop in UK but the plan was to

1953
01:22:53,359 --> 01:23:00,319
produce two apps one for Android one for

1954
01:22:56,349 --> 01:23:02,510
iOS and connect the Shopify into the app

1955
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:05,359
so when we sell a product

1956
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:08,900
we want to capture the information from

1957
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:12,349
the customer how they used it and how it

1958
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:15,769
can help for us to choose the next next

1959
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:18,260
product but the GDP odd thing you talked

1960
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:20,480
about is very interesting because we

1961
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:24,260
already starting to sell not just in UK

1962
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:28,309
or Germany in France and how do we sort

1963
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:31,310
of manage that is a thing that I have no

1964
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:35,510
idea I wonder do you have any come talk

1965
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:38,270
to us later but yeah I think okay the

1966
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:41,119
rule is privacy by default or privacy by

1967
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:44,000
design so you have the tracking you have

1968
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:46,849
needs to be disabled but you are able to

1969
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,470
ask your client that he shares the

1970
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:50,510
information with you it's still possible

1971
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:52,730
you just need to say why you want

1972
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:54,380
wanting the data and be collected what

1973
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:56,059
kind of Tidy I want to collect it and

1974
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:58,279
you need to ask for permission and you

1975
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:00,289
can do the same thing patients can ask

1976
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:03,739
for it back - that's the other thing so

1977
01:24:00,289 --> 01:24:04,909
it is complex yeah it's it's GPR sounds

1978
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:06,710
scary but it's quite simple as long as

1979
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:08,000
you give consent and there is a reason

1980
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:09,739
for you to have that consent which

1981
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,479
sounds like you want to provide better

1982
01:24:09,739 --> 01:24:13,279
service your customers just build your

1983
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,509
privacy policy in a way that gets that

1984
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:16,399
consent and then you can do pretty much

1985
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:18,440
whatever you want as long as you define

1986
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:19,969
yourself as the data controller in that

1987
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:22,699
matter short answer is complicated

1988
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:23,630
any other questions and see us later - I

1989
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:25,519
have a quick question when you talk

1990
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:28,550
about AI and all these things how do you

1991
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:30,650
deal with implicit biases or the

1992
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:32,239
challenges you have of gathering quality

1993
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:34,219
information because you can make the

1994
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,750
smartest machine but if you tell it dumb

1995
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:37,610
[ __ ] it's gonna be a dumb [ __ ] good

1996
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:39,920
question like you know garbage in

1997
01:24:37,609 --> 01:24:42,339
garbage out I think that's right that's

1998
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:44,869
the same basic right

1999
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:47,539
the expert evidence in the Vancouver

2000
01:24:44,869 --> 01:24:51,579
dispensary case was that patients want

2001
01:24:47,539 --> 01:24:53,930
to see the product smell the product

2002
01:24:51,579 --> 01:24:57,109
like going to the grocery store and

2003
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:58,280
buying your groceries so how do you deal

2004
01:24:57,109 --> 01:25:01,460
with that

2005
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:03,380
you have a license to sell online Canada

2006
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:05,409
only allows that I think you in Shoppers

2007
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:08,239
Drug Mart the only ones who have it

2008
01:25:05,409 --> 01:25:10,159
medical patients only get it in the mail

2009
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:11,829
and they complain that it's in the

2010
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:14,090
container they have to open it up

2011
01:25:11,829 --> 01:25:15,710
sometimes there's some problem with it

2012
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:16,289
they send it back so it delays them

2013
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,270
getting there

2014
01:25:16,289 --> 01:25:20,670
medicine so that the evidence from the

2015
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:23,730
patients and an expert doctors of burkas

2016
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:27,239
from the states was that this was a very

2017
01:25:23,729 --> 01:25:29,909
important part of delivering medical for

2018
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:32,279
medical patients so I'm not sure if the

2019
01:25:29,909 --> 01:25:34,829
drone can come and drop down and give an

2020
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:36,210
option and go back up and you can pick

2021
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:38,489
or how you're gonna deal with that

2022
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:40,079
technological well especially in it I'm

2023
01:25:38,489 --> 01:25:42,090
sorry but in Germany actually that's

2024
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:46,350
illegal so you have to go to the

2025
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:48,000
pharmacy and the medical I guess culture

2026
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:49,980
here I mean the output takers are

2027
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,260
trained to actually mean that's why they

2028
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:53,969
want patients to go to the pharmacy to

2029
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:56,610
literally have the pharmacist who is

2030
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:58,980
trained in this handover that drug but

2031
01:25:56,609 --> 01:26:00,630
to your point there may be regulatory

2032
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:01,979
issues that say you can't do it as

2033
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:03,600
you're doing in Canada which affects

2034
01:26:01,979 --> 01:26:06,209
other signaling seized a sale for

2035
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,250
example but then you're gonna also in in

2036
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:10,470
terms of access issues if you're too

2037
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:13,260
sick to get to the pharmacy but those

2038
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:16,140
are places where technology can in fact

2039
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:19,560
begin to start to connect them but as we

2040
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:21,390
find privacy issues all are all the way

2041
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:24,420
along this because it's not just a

2042
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:26,310
product that you can buy like a regular

2043
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:28,829
commodity product this is still

2044
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:31,020
stigmatized so privacy is in the room at

2045
01:26:28,829 --> 01:26:32,579
every single point actually I think it's

2046
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,960
gonna be based on preference I mean if

2047
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:35,579
you prefer to have a dropship to your

2048
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,380
front door than okay but that'll never

2049
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:38,850
replace the retail experience are you

2050
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,900
going in there and smelling different

2051
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:41,789
things the only thing it will do is

2052
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:43,949
enhance it right and so we're seeing

2053
01:26:41,789 --> 01:26:45,750
enhancement of that retail experience so

2054
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:47,460
in Vancouver is a lot different than

2055
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:49,079
Germany and that's the evolution from

2056
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:50,670
medical to rec that we're seeing as well

2057
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,170
right if you're coming from a North

2058
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:54,029
American perspective you're already

2059
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:56,850
going well isn't it just like alcohol

2060
01:26:54,029 --> 01:26:58,319
and why can't you buy it and consume it

2061
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:59,430
like you do alcohol and the

2062
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:00,899
internationally was true it's still

2063
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:02,850
talking about it medically and what is

2064
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:04,439
it you know is it a medicine is it you

2065
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,840
pick it up in a pharmacy can you get it

2066
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:08,429
online so I think if you look forward a

2067
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,440
few years you're gonna see that same

2068
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:13,079
change happen that's happening in North

2069
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:15,059
America as it tries to embrace it in a

2070
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:16,739
recreational adult use way and have a

2071
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,760
retail experience around it yeah you

2072
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:19,229
know what said you about Canada I'm

2073
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,119
sorry to drive you but in Canada it

2074
01:27:19,229 --> 01:27:22,589
seems like the privacy aspect was not

2075
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,090
really brought up until it went into the

2076
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:26,579
recreational market which is an

2077
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:27,900
interesting twist I thought anyway but

2078
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:30,689
but that question in regards to

2079
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:31,978
brick-and-mortar versus ecommerce is

2080
01:27:30,689 --> 01:27:33,869
we shouldn't even be talking about it

2081
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:35,489
right it's the same question that was 30

2082
01:27:33,868 --> 01:27:37,649
years ago in regards to of 20 years ago

2083
01:27:35,488 --> 01:27:39,808
in regards to e-commerce in general and

2084
01:27:37,649 --> 01:27:44,668
now you see ecommerce growing endlessly

2085
01:27:39,809 --> 01:27:46,439
and malls in the u.s. nothing to do with

2086
01:27:44,668 --> 01:27:48,719
privacy was talking about the consumer

2087
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:50,939
experience of choosing a product without

2088
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:53,130
being able to touch smell and understand

2089
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:54,900
it and that's a classic question of you

2090
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:56,189
know weed is different and we're gonna

2091
01:27:54,899 --> 01:27:57,779
go a little long because I'm getting

2092
01:27:56,189 --> 01:28:00,300
passionate now weed is different than

2093
01:27:57,779 --> 01:28:01,768
lumber or a blender right you don't have

2094
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:04,019
to smell a blender you don't need to

2095
01:28:01,769 --> 01:28:05,579
look at the crystals on a blender right

2096
01:28:04,019 --> 01:28:06,958
you want to smell your weed you want to

2097
01:28:05,578 --> 01:28:08,880
look at it you maybe want to talk to the

2098
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:10,198
person about the genetics and you want

2099
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,578
to know something about the grower and

2100
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:15,719
how it was grown and different always

2101
01:28:14,578 --> 01:28:17,158
get that experience

2102
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:18,958
no but that's immature and that's the

2103
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:20,339
maturity of the industry right because

2104
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:22,050
right now I think that's because

2105
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:23,189
inconsistent product might be coming

2106
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:25,110
through and you can't get the same

2107
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:26,820
experiences it's not you can give five

2108
01:28:25,109 --> 01:28:28,828
different growers the same cut and come

2109
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:30,328
up with five different styles and five

2110
01:28:28,828 --> 01:28:32,368
different smells of five different

2111
01:28:30,328 --> 01:28:34,139
effects all from the same weed so it's

2112
01:28:32,368 --> 01:28:36,238
really hard to you can get another why

2113
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:38,849
make a or a double Bock or whatever it's

2114
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,348
very hard to get different to make sure

2115
01:28:38,849 --> 01:28:41,788
people are consistent the blue dream

2116
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:43,559
from one person is different than blue

2117
01:28:41,788 --> 01:28:45,149
dream from another person and it's you

2118
01:28:43,559 --> 01:28:46,590
and here's the other thing right so I

2119
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:48,179
mean I know that this discussion is

2120
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:50,729
saying there's no Pratt were fewer

2121
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:52,859
privacy discussions in e-commerce but

2122
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:54,329
there are actually a lot it is there a

2123
01:28:52,859 --> 01:28:55,498
question there was another question I

2124
01:28:54,328 --> 01:28:58,399
think what time is it though because

2125
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:58,399
we're running super late
