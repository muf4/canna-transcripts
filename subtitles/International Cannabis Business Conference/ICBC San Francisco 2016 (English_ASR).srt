1
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,230
is this an international business

2
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,090
company and many people who came here

3
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:44,059
kind of took a chance bought a ticket

4
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,920
wasn't sure what to expect right and the

5
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,350
feedback I'm getting is I can't believe

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,070
this I didn't know what was going to be

7
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,210
this good what they mean by good is

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,609
information and networking and just a

9
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,000
gentle attitude of the people here just

10
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:01,310
want to thank Alex and the dial for

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,420
putting on an event that really blends

12
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,820
activism and business in a really really

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,150
great way and I believe in karma I

14
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:14,179
believe in community I believe in love

15
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,260
and understanding and I actually believe

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,630
if you hold true to some of those

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,950
tenants and precepts that you're only

18
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:21,319
going to benefit yourself for so many

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,030
reasons and in my case it's actually

20
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,849
helped me make money also so it's this

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,618
new win-win situation that's happening

22
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,390
with the cannabis industry in particular

23
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:31,099
and I think that's what people are very

24
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,069
surprised about that that they can make

25
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,289
money they could be successful and no

26
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,789
one else has still to lose we just

27
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,440
wrapped it up here at the international

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,140
cannabis business conference on a

29
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,728
fantastic time steve blum from celeb

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,399
stoner and freedom leaf magazine was

31
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,259
here Steve DeAngelo was here Ethan

32
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,109
Nadelmann from the drug policy alliance

33
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,118
gave an impassioned impassioned speech

34
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:56,209
about what we need to do if people are

35
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,310
actually overly excited and happy that

36
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:01,549
we have decided to dedicate so much of

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,368
this to culture politics and advocacy

38
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:08,599
and I'm tremendously happy with the

39
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:10,909
feedback ever dad a small group of

40
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,909
concerned citizens can change the world

41
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:16,120
it is indeed the only thing that ever

42
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:16,120
has
