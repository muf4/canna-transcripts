1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,759
all right so yeah my name is beau

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,839
whitney i'm the chief revenue officer at

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,279
mantis growth investments basically what

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,519
mantis does is

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,480
is we buy companies

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,800
we

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,719
keep try to retain the management

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
in the company

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,320
optimize them

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,719
take profits and then invest those into

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,320
other companies so we're multi-state

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:32,399
operator we're

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,558
currently operating in nevada with

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,359
cultivation and retail

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,839
um

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,558
so today i wanted to talk about

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,480
the cannabis industry

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,959
first globally i always like to start

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,878
globally and then

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
talk about europe and then throw in a

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,280
little bit of hemp

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,878
and then talk about the impact of u.s

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,920
regulatory changes on the global market

24
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,000
so the

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,079
reform in the global basis is

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,238
accelerating

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
over 60 countries have

28
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,519
legalized cannabis in some form either

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
for industrial purposes adult use

30
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,158
medical

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,079
cbd

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,560
and by our calculations there's roughly

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:18,000
250 million consumers

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,799
generating about 250 billion dollars

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,719
per year and that's excluding him

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,479
and governments are

37
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,200
driving this reform because they see the

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,359
benefits of cannabis on their economy

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,439
either from a taxation perspective a

40
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,759
development perspective employment

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,078
perspective and the like

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,200
but current policies in the u.s right

43
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:42,158
now i think are actually hurting the u.s

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,879
global competitiveness

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
relative to you know the global market

46
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,438
and it's opening the door for

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,079
the rest of the world and so i'll go

48
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,599
into that in a little bit

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,559
um right now we're estimating the total

50
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:01,199
market between 230 billion dollars

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,759
and 250 billion dollars um

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,840
us currently holds the top spot

53
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,599
um but the eu represents the second

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,520
largest market

55
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,840
in the on the globe

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
but this is from a revenue perspective

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,159
there are currently 24 eu

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,560
countries that have some form of legal

59
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,560
access

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
now there were some questions i inserted

61
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,878
this at lunch there are some questions

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,120
about the total

63
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,120
legal market for

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
for cannabis in the united states we're

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,840
forecasting

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,319
about 25 billion this year growing to

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,000
about 45 billion by 2025

68
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,719
so there's still

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,919
good opportunity for growth assuming

70
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,400
that there's some regulatory changes now

71
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,359
when i look at this graph i see that

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,760
green

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,599
as the legal market

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,159
but the difference between that green

75
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,639
and the top of that orange there that's

76
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,560
opportunity to me and so there's still a

77
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,559
great deal of opportunity within the u.s

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
market as there is in the european

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,479
market the african market the asian

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,479
markets

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,000
now

82
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,479
mantis collaborates with

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,959
my firm whitney economics and so we do a

84
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,439
lot of data sharing and we use data in

85
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
our in our decision making process for

86
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,039
investments

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,878
market entry strategies and the like

88
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,878
and we have a forecast for every country

89
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,759
in the world from a total addressable

90
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,000
market perspective

91
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,560
now what we're forecasting actually and

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
this seems counter narrative

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,120
we're actually forecasting an eventual

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
decline in the total addressable market

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,039
in the u.s

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,280
and it's because that as the market

97
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,039
opens in the u.s there's going to be an

98
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,598
influx of low-cost cannabis products

99
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,519
which will drive down the price

100
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,359
and there will be less spending even

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,438
though there may be more consumers

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
there'll be less spending and so we're

103
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,120
actually

104
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,119
thinking that

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,519
north america's nearest peak in terms of

106
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,318
total addressable market value

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,200
now

108
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,839
on the eu side

109
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,959
just five countries represents about 60

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,798
to 63 percent of the total market value

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,319
in the european union it's about 63

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,198
billion dollars

113
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,478
italy france germany uk and spain

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
um

115
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,758
now

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,040
if you think about this at look at

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,080
germany for example 8.4 billion dollars

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,720
you've got 80 000 medical consumers

119
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,039
arguably a couple hundred billion or a

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,199
couple hundred million in sales

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
so the difference between that couple

122
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,439
hundred million

123
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,359
and eight

124
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,719
point 8.4 billion once again is

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
opportunity

126
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,199
and i think governments like to see

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
large numbers

128
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,478
they like the taxation they like the

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
employment

130
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,879
they like all that

131
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,758
which is represented in that opportunity

132
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,719
so

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,319
there's

134
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
it's important to

135
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,199
realize where the opportunities lie

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
and then position yourself in order to

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
enter into those markets at such a time

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,199
that you can take advantage of that

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,840
growth situation

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,240
so being a medical supplier for example

141
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,879
especially in the eu

142
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
could pave your way towards accelerated

143
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,240
growth

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,720
once more reform occurs

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,600
or establishing a brand say in cbd or in

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,199
hemp

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
positioning yourself in the market and

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,120
then taking advantage of growth that way

149
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,038
too

150
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,160
and one other thing here is

151
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,000
that

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,400
access defines

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,720
opportunity so if there's a great deal

154
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,959
of control over the market you're not

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,039
going to have as much opportunity but if

156
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,839
you open things up for adult use and

157
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,199
like

158
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,879
then you can accelerate and capture that

159
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,038
market share

160
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,038
so access equals opportunity

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
so

162
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
we also

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,000
look at markets

164
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,519
not from a dollar perspective i think an

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,959
earlier

166
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,959
speaker mentioned

167
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,519
that there's a human element to this and

168
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,159
so let's not forget about that

169
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:15,038
but it's surprising to note that

170
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,319
europe is ranked fourth when it comes to

171
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,240
the total number of cannabis consumers

172
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,039
globally

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,879
and

174
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,560
asia and africa actually represent the

175
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,279
top two markets

176
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,240
um and so

177
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,719
the way that i view this as well is

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,319
if you can look at these markets

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
see where there's a lot of consumers

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,720
even though it may not be a tremendous

181
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,039
amount you can position yourself and

182
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,759
capture that and hold you know your

183
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,639
first mark first mover position

184
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,639
for quite some time

185
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
so

186
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,280
western europe there's really no

187
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,959
surprise here italy france germany spain

188
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,198
there's a lot of consumers there from

189
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,439
this perspective but there's also a lot

190
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,960
of consumers in eastern europe and

191
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,759
southern europe

192
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,359
and there's a dynamic here where the

193
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,680
periphery countries are the suppliers

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
and the western european countries are

195
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,439
the consumers

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,038
and so there's this you know center

197
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,160
periphery dynamic that's in play and

198
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,839
so

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,520
seeing this and understanding it is

200
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,079
going to play a role

201
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,478
in how the market is shaped moving

202
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,478
forward

203
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,079
so there's

204
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,918
like i said there's

205
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,839
a lot of economic benefits associated

206
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,719
with cannabis um

207
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,198
you know in addition to

208
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,440
medical and full legalization

209
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
and there's a lot of traction

210
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,598
covid was interesting in the in the

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,399
sense that it actually hurt people's

212
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,159
access through the lack of ability for

213
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,159
regulators to get to

214
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,319
inspections and like but it also

215
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,479
accelerated the conversation

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,439
saying hey there's maybe a constraint

217
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,800
like they occurred in italy or france

218
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,279
and we need to

219
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,038
drive greater access because there or

220
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,159
greater supply in the market because

221
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,159
there's less access

222
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,160
and brexit was kind of interesting

223
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,199
timing as well because that kind of

224
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,960
messed up

225
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,280
that the opportunity in the in the

226
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,878
trajectory of the uk market

227
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,519
um basically it stifled the imports that

228
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,960
was driving the supply and as a result

229
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,079
it stalled out the growth in the market

230
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,038
um

231
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,199
and

232
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,958
you know each one of these

233
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
markets is different

234
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,918
and

235
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,879
success is defined by the ease of your

236
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,559
regulatory activities and the like

237
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,240
and there's some obstacles obviously

238
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,239
there with

239
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
barriers to entry and the like

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,759
but

241
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,519
but you know even though there are these

242
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,159
opportunities

243
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,159
there's still a couple of headwinds like

244
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,838
regulatory murkiness high barrier sentry

245
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,879
in the like

246
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,800
but i think if these five or six

247
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,600
countries i have listed here

248
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,679
if they all converge about the same time

249
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,000
it'll drive opportunities not only

250
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:15,359
within western europe but eastern

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
southern northern europe as well

252
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,719
so rather than takeaways i think these

253
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,599
are more observations

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,120
um

255
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
a lot of the suppliers that i've talked

256
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,080
to

257
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,360
in asia and india

258
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
in africa

259
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
south america and like

260
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,080
they're all focusing in on the european

261
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,799
market in germany in particular

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,360
but if they all actually are able to

263
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,120
supply into this market there's going to

264
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,639
be so much supply that it's going to

265
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,080
drive down prices

266
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,240
it's going to create an oversupply

267
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,959
situation

268
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,600
so even though european market

269
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,319
represents great opportunity um there is

270
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,200
a risk that operators need to be aware

271
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
of

272
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,560
um and one thing that's interesting

273
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,920
about europe is that they're actually

274
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,199
setting standards i know there's been a

275
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,240
lot of discussion

276
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,040
about the problems associated with

277
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
with

278
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,719
eu gmp and getting certified but i think

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,679
those standards will proliferate across

280
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,360
the globe and will drive standards in

281
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,479
the u.s as well

282
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,320
so

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,159
you know it's kind of take the good with

284
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,240
the bad i guess

285
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,278
and it's still dynamic

286
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,120
so

287
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:31,278
you know i think most of the issues

288
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,720
if you're a supplier trying to feed into

289
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,200
the european union

290
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,278
a lot of the issues occur on the inbound

291
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,278
side it's easy to get product

292
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,078
out of the country but it's really

293
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:45,120
difficult to get it into a country uk is

294
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,278
a prime example but switzerland and and

295
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,519
other countries within the eu are are

296
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,439
facing those problems and so

297
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,639
it's i think it's critical that you

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,640
partner with

299
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:59,919
not only a good eu licensee but partner

300
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,559
with a good european familiar logistics

301
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,599
company and supply chain company so that

302
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,599
you can

303
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
not have your product sitting at the

304
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
port

305
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:13,000
gathering dust or rotting as it you know

306
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,000
sits in a container

307
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,919
so i've got some recommendations here

308
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,039
i'm not going to go through them all but

309
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,919
here's some of the top five markets and

310
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,958
some areas where you might want to look

311
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,879
at positioning your your products and

312
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,039
there's really three big opportunities

313
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,278
pharma medical and consumer product

314
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,120
goods uh cbd

315
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,078
falls into all three of these

316
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,560
but it's really important to

317
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,120
knowing what market you want to get into

318
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,278
having a vision taking advantage of that

319
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,440
and really committing to it rather than

320
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,559
trying to be all things to all people

321
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,519
that's

322
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,759
very rarely successful

323
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,000
and i think it's important also given

324
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,200
how dynamic the market is to remain very

325
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,958
very nimble

326
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,480
and adjust to the market conditions as

327
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,479
they change and they will change

328
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,199
so i want to switch gears a little bit

329
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,039
to him

330
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,639
there's a lot of discussion today about

331
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,639
hemp as well

332
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
hemp has a long tradition in the eu

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
mainly on the fiber and grain side but

334
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,039
now

335
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,679
there's a

336
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,519
you know this emerging cbd market

337
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,000
i have here is a

338
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,839
number of acres planted in a number of

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
acres that were planted that's

340
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,760
associated with cbd

341
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:37,200
globally it's about 56 60 percent

342
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,720
is dedicated to cbd of the planted acres

343
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,320
but maybe

344
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,480
50 or so in the european union

345
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,079
and

346
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
if

347
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,319
if

348
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,000
if there's not enough demand

349
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,839
and you start importing from canada from

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,519
the u.s from china

351
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,079
there could be a pretty significant

352
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,159
impact on the on the market both here

353
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,159
and abroad

354
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,078
so

355
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,319
i look at the

356
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,000
at the market somewhat differently seems

357
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,360
like a lot of the analysts right now are

358
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,600
focused on the retail demand

359
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,519
i look at the capacity in the market how

360
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
much can the market supply

361
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,200
and it really

362
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,800
you know shifts your focus a little bit

363
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
um and i'm

364
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,000
because

365
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,639
um there's the forecasts right now are

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,078
so dynamic out there that it's tough to

367
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,959
understand who's the most accurate

368
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,039
or you know and like so there's some

369
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,439
problems with forecasting these days

370
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,120
especially given the lack of systemic

371
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,279
data systems

372
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,278
but i'm forecasting that the eu has

373
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,720
enough capacity

374
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:56,320
on the hemp side cbd side to satisfy 4.3

375
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,560
billion dollars in retail demand

376
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,079
and this is based upon

377
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,439
isolate i could do this for full

378
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,879
spectrum

379
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
or whatever but i just chose

380
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,000
isolate because it's

381
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,599
the

382
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,078
lowest yield and so it's this is

383
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,920
but high cost of production

384
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,679
now there's lots of forecasts so

385
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,639
depending upon which forecast you

386
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,439
believe

387
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,480
there's either too much supply

388
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,079
of cbd in the from the europeans or

389
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,560
there's not enough and if there's not

390
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,559
enough then that's great for

391
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,679
importation for exporters from other

392
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,359
markets

393
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,879
but if there's

394
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,720
too little

395
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,120
um

396
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,879
or if there's too much then

397
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,600
you know

398
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,879
that you know that's problematic as well

399
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,800
so i think in europe for cbd the

400
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,078
opportunity is good but

401
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,519
it's not

402
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,799
a panacea

403
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,720
it's not

404
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,639
uh you know you're not gonna plant some

405
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,639
plants harvest them

406
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,440
and then get rich right and live in

407
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,320
mallorca or something um so and not

408
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
everybody will win

409
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,680
so in terms of an outlook while

410
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,519
cbd is sexy for now

411
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,439
there's lots of opportunities the

412
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,759
opportunities for fiber and grain is

413
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,279
transformational there's opportunities

414
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,399
in automotive

415
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,399
in textiles in plastics and construction

416
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,679
especially on the fiber side

417
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,600
and there's strong opportunities in

418
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,958
grain as well for animal and human

419
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
consumption

420
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,319
so

421
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,958
my best advice is

422
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,959
establish relationships now

423
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,599
develop the supply chain

424
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,078
partner with eu members and then partner

425
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
with people abroad

426
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,958
and then expect price decreases as the

427
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,120
market settles

428
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,119
and pick a path you can't do it all

429
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,600
so

430
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
the topic of full federal legalization

431
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,839
has been

432
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,679
in a lot of the media especially in the

433
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
united states

434
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,559
and

435
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,000
there's some bills that have been

436
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,879
proposed

437
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,120
that could be really just horrible for

438
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,720
the u.s cannabis market the higher thc

439
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,679
side

440
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,000
and

441
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:17,198
a couple of the bills namely the

442
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,399
more recent caoa and the more act on the

443
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,559
house side

444
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,720
is they're not expected to pass but

445
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,000
they're setting kind of a dangerous

446
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,440
precedent for

447
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,278
policy

448
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
but assuming that those

449
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,480
don't pass

450
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,239
there's still a movement afoot to drive

451
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,278
full federal legalization in the united

452
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,799
states

453
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,799
the impact that this will have will be

454
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,838
rather profound

455
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,359
it'll accelerate the pace of reform

456
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,839
worldwide

457
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,879
it will influence international treaties

458
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,959
because

459
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,720
cannabis is demonized throughout the

460
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,919
world

461
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,920
and that will draw the attention also

462
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,919
into the u.s right now some of the

463
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,519
policies being proposed allow for

464
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,439
immediate importation from other

465
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,159
countries into the u.s

466
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,279
so

467
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,678
while the focus right now is on the eu

468
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,639
there's going to be a lot of opportunity

469
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,079
on the export side into the u.s

470
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,319
given that

471
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,078
international suppliers will have a

472
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,480
competitive advantage

473
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,879
relative to the u.s suppliers if a lot

474
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
of these policies are implemented

475
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,400
um

476
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,640
and so this will lead to an expansion of

477
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,038
the global supply chain

478
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,480
it'll introduce opportunities in on

479
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,879
practically every continent um and then

480
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,079
ultimately as the market settles then

481
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,840
proximity to markets will play a role

482
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,798
you know the suppliers in azerbaijan

483
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,678
will

484
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,160
be here the suppliers in central and

485
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,360
south america and mexico will focus on

486
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,320
the on the north american market

487
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,639
so in that sense as the dust settles

488
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,319
there'll be this proximity play

489
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,679
and so right now

490
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,279
is the time to set up those

491
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,038
relationships

492
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,200
but

493
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,960
in the meanwhile this this whole

494
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,120
regulatory murkiness

495
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,480
regardless of if it's local

496
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,399
in germany

497
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,720
in switzerland

498
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,038
in south america and north america

499
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,558
that remains the number one risk to the

500
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,319
industry

501
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,678
until that's settled

502
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,678
then it's really tough to understand the

503
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,360
rules of the game it's really tough to

504
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,480
understand your business plans your

505
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,479
profitability and the like

506
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,480
so in summary um

507
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,840
well

508
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,558
i want to thank the icbc team

509
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,558
uh for this opportunity to speak um this

510
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,038
has been a great first day we've got

511
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,519
another speaker coming up which we'll

512
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,519
talk about investment and like in in

513
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,200
both cannabis and hemp but

514
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,440
um you know

515
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
this marketplace is very dynamic right

516
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
now

517
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,519
um but this is just the beginning and so

518
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,119
a lot of folks are thinking that they're

519
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:01,119
fatigued that they've been doing this

520
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:03,839
for four five ten years and they're done

521
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,079
but this is just the beginning

522
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,000
but when you do operate

523
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,558
be sure to think about this global

524
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,240
opportunity in the global competition

525
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,240
the global supply chain

526
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,000
but when you're thinking about that

527
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
global

528
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,880
situation global environment be sure to

529
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,080
act local because really

530
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,360
right now

531
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,038
cannabis is a local phenomenon

532
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,119
so thank you very much i can take some

533
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:32,759
questions yes yes let's hear it one more

534
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,759
time vote whitney

535
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
um thank you for the presentation and i

536
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,679
can subscribe a lot of it but i'm

537
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,319
interested in your assessment that

538
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,200
when us is changing the legislation

539
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,200
europe will follow

540
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,440
what makes you believe that i think

541
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,840
there were a lot of u.s companies who

542
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,320
thought putting the boot on the grounds

543
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:03,359
will change his europe

544
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:07,038
and move to the u.s attitude and we did

545
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,918
not see that we see tesla now failing

546
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,558
why you think it will do so because

547
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,640
exchanging with the international

548
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,519
narcotic control board

549
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,520
i don't see that

550
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,440
yes so thank you for the question

551
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:25,038
um really it the question is is why do i

552
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,720
think that

553
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,759
the u.s legalization will have an

554
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,798
influence on the european market

555
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,519
the way that i view this is that

556
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,400
when you have a large market

557
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,720
and they legalize adult use then there's

558
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,440
this ripple effect we saw in the united

559
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,360
states on the west coast one

560
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
state legalized then the next then the

561
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,519
next

562
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,919
that same type of phenomena will occur

563
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,400
from country to country so if the u.s is

564
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,320
legal and there's this great opportunity

565
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
then not only does it drive these

566
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,119
international treaties and changes to

567
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,280
the un unodc and all these other

568
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,839
policies but those policies have been

569
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,359
restricting the growth of all of the

570
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,959
markets in the world

571
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,199
so by

572
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,079
by influencing these treaties

573
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,240
and by driving this cascade effect

574
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,399
through legalization at the adult use

575
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,798
level it will have this contagion that

576
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,600
will carry over into the european market

577
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,599
and then elsewhere

578
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,079
thank you very much for this very

579
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,320
informative

580
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,519
speech my name is luke i'm a cannabis

581
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,558
filmmaker

582
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,359
um

583
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,678
i really loved your last point like this

584
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,558
think global act local

585
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,240
my first cannabis hemp reference was

586
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,798
visiting the himalayan mountains in

587
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,839
nepal witnessing minorities excluded

588
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:51,119
from society using wild plants for good

589
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,678
for establishing a very local

590
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,959
beneficial economy model that is

591
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,880
basically beneficial for everyone so

592
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,038
my question is like how do we get there

593
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,280
we are talking about legislations laws

594
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,279
like so much bureaucracy

595
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,678
just taking your last point for me it

596
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,038
seems like the easiest way to make this

597
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,440
think local

598
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,400
think global act local point

599
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,400
happen

600
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,798
is to just leave everyone using the

601
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,840
plant the way they want to

602
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,839
what do you think about this

603
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
yeah i

604
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,158
right now the way that regulatory

605
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,919
structures are operating is they want to

606
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,159
control things they

607
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,159
they think that cannabis is is a bad

608
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,520
thing and even though they're trying to

609
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,360
reform

610
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,119
they're still trying to control even on

611
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,199
the hemp side they're treating it as

612
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,319
though it's illegal even though for the

613
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,120
most part it's been generally legalized

614
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,839
and

615
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,319
but

616
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,558
i think on the local side

617
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,240
when there's job creation

618
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,639
where there's that

619
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,279
you know everybody has a story about

620
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,280
their cannabis use and their cannabis

621
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,879
story it's you know they got into the

622
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,599
industry because of

623
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,679
of their sister or their brother their

624
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:08,480
wife or their husband you know because

625
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:10,480
of some ailment that cannabis has been

626
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,038
used to help address

627
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,679
it's those localized stories

628
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,879
that really change policy and generate

629
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,640
momentum

630
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,679
and so

631
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,080
so i think on the on the act local side

632
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:29,120
it's more about how to drive reform

633
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,279
and one are the comment on that

634
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,918
i've been giving a lot of speeches

635
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,079
around the globe recently

636
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,440
but i've been speaking to small

637
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,519
audiences

638
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,600
in some instances like

639
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:46,558
city councils mayors police departments

640
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:50,000
and you know they once they're

641
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:52,960
they see the value and that the plant

642
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,720
actually does a lot of wonderful things

643
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,120
then they tend to

644
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,319
be more willing to embrace it but that

645
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:03,759
educational process it takes time

646
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,240
and you have to do it on a city by city

647
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,158
community by community basis so

648
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,038
it's really at this point it's still

649
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
very very local

650
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,759
hi first thanks for all the data

651
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,720
material you shared with us was exciting

652
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,440
great numbers and i wanted to ask you

653
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,440
about what you said about regulation in

654
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,360
europe and how it would affect like the

655
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,798
global market i was pretty surprised

656
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,519
about that because i wouldn't have

657
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,200
expected that new usa would have an eye

658
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,440
on european regulation

659
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
and which field exactly and

660
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,400
why and how do you

661
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,440
think

662
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,080
like european regulation could affect

663
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,038
for example u.s market

664
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,839
yeah so

665
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,720
so currently in the in the u.s there are

666
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:55,199
some standards but they're not very

667
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,480
uniform or widespread they're not

668
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,798
adopted

669
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,880
um and as a result there could be some

670
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,319
public safety issues associated with the

671
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,520
way that the market's operating right

672
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,158
now

673
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:10,158
and so by having an example like

674
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,120
eu gmp certification

675
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,480
if that it becomes the de facto standard

676
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,959
in the united states

677
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,360
then there's this public safety

678
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,319
element associated with that and so i

679
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,038
think

680
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,439
on the public safety side this is where

681
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,519
europe has the lead right now

682
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,360
and are starting to influence and given

683
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,759
the fact that there's so much

684
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,639
focus on the european market

685
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,798
people want to conform to that standard

686
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,000
and that will be a differentiating

687
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,278
factor for operators in these other

688
