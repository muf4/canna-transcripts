1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,199
to the ICBC this is our third iteration

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:10,320
in uh Barcelona we started this out

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,059
about seven eight years ago I started it

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,040
in Oregon and I thought one day we're

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,739
going to become International and

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,939
eventually we became International our

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,858
two big events are here in

8
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:26,219
Barcelona and our Flagship event is in

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,039
Berlin uh this summer June 29th and 30th

10
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,618
and that will be our sixth edition in

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,140
Berlin uh the ICBC

12
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:37,019
we only have one rule and that's don't

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,840
be a dick and treat everybody with

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,760
respect and love because the ICBC is

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,940
more than just a conference we're a

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:48,179
family and we are

17
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,759
we're very we're in honor of the plan

18
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,320
right the plane the cannabis plant

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,420
because if it wasn't for the cannabis

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,820
plant we would not all be here together

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,620
so cannabis does a lot of things for the

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,420
world whether it's medical whether it's

23
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,919
environmental

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,600
um whether it's just to be able to chill

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
with your friends and have a good time

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
and of course we know incarcerating

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
people for using cannabis is a

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,460
ridiculous idea and prohibition does not

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,859
work

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,959
we're here for business and the business

31
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,519
I found out the more you perpetuate the

32
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,679
business the more you perpetuate the

33
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,719
politics and move the public policy

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,299
forward and that's what we're here to do

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:28,140
we're here to do business to approach to

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,540
talk to each other to uh uh to create

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,280
with each other and today there will be

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,920
tens of millions of dollars of business

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,799
that gets done and manifest itself

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,960
immediately or residually so I just want

41
