00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,878

17
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,840
daughter uh

anuka and uh we've been here almost 2

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,159
years now

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,439
uh and uh we're just having such a great

21
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,960
time here and it's a real real honor to

22
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,279
be here with you all and to live in your

23
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,959
wonderful country um so I'll get started

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,560
by uh

25
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,879
saying um I I'll start with some of my

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,519
successes um I'm in the Kansas industry

27
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:35,719
I've been in the legal Canabis industry

28
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:39,239
for about 15 years now I started what

29
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,158
people would call um non-plant touching

30
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,519
businesses in the Cannabis industry we

31
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,159
like to say there's plant- touching

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,280
businesses and there's nonplant touching

33
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,520
businesses and what that really means is

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,680
when you legalize cannabis and or

35
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,840
liberalize the laws or modernize policy

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,320
uh for whatever reasons be it human

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,280
rights be it compassion be it uh Common

38
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,359
Sense there is a a ripple effect in

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,478
terms of the industry and it's very

40
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,000
interesting I think a lot of people

41
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:12,120
don't understand all the benefits uh

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,199
economically uh for Canabis again

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,879
legalize under whatever opice is medical

44
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,799
recreational albe it so my so I'll I'll

45
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,399
start with just saying what my What I've

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,480
Done uh thus far and the first business

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,680
I started was 15 years ago it was a

48
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,280
medical marijuana clinic we call that a

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,080
nonplant touching business it's not

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,680
dispensary it was a clinic and I have a

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,400
a series a set of doctors who who I

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,800
hired to work for me and in the last 15

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,239
years we uh carded carded that's what we

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,159
call it it's not a prescription in

55
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,280
America now is it it's a recommendation

56
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,878
because it's not legal from the FDA so

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,680
we call it a recommendation we CED over

58
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:58,079
20,000 people and uh and so I not only

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,640
did did I create a business that made

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,599
money for me we were actually able to

61
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,559
change the dynamic of the community it

62
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,119
was a more prosperous community and it

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,158
was a safer Community because what we

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,000
did is we created safe access for

65
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:18,679
patients and we literally took cannabis

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,919
off the black market uh no small task in

67
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,840
a in a valley in southern Oregon which

68
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,798
was known for growing over a billion

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,080
dollars worth of elicit

70
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:33,400
cannabis that market got flipped over

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,400
and it all went into the the list market

72
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,760
so this is a very interesting time in my

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,560
life um I was able to revolutionize

74
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,639
medical marijuana in America um I'm the

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,959
first person to advertise on network TV

76
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,919
and uh make it mainstream if if you will

77
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,360
and that was also no small task because

78
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,039
uh I actually had to make this

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
commercial myself they wouldn't make it

80
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,639
for me I made the commercial and uh and

81
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
I made it extremely professional I took

82
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,559
the extra effort to make it professional

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,560
presented it to them and off we went

84
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,799
with this amazing uh business that was

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,479
actually helping the community at the

86
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,400
same time I was an activist 30 years ago

87
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:17,039
today I was on the corner of hate

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,478
ashberry in San Francisco I lived in

89
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,479
Berkeley and I commuted and I took the

90
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,120
Bay Bridge over to ha Ashbury where

91
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,959
Debbie goldsbury through a man named

92
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,680
Dennis Peron who's the Godfather of the

93
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:32,478
medical marijuana movement had a booth

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,959
on the corner and we sold stickers and

95
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:39,360
we had a jar for donations even though

96
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:41,638
we call them stations ha and we we uh

97
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
and and and we said legalize candidates

98
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,120
and we also had petitions and we were

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,800
there getting signatures for what would

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,079
then turn out to be proposition 215

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,160
which is the first medical marijuana law

102
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,038
in America from California which was

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,400
passed in

104
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:00,000
1996 so when I started into business I

105
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,239
thought I felt a little guil guilty I

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
thought man you know what this I'm not

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,759
an activist now I'm going to be a

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,479
businessman but my heart stayed the same

109
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,960
therefore when I acred for lack there of

110
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:16,918
a better term influence and Power in the

111
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:21,120
community I used it to the advantage of

112
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:24,719
the people to raise the tide because the

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,240
tide all boats Rise Up When The Tide

114
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,639
Rises up and I realized I'm more an

115
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,720
activist now ever as a business

116
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,400
businessman so I think I'll get to this

117
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,360
in a second so I think this is an

118
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:39,239
important thing uh for for Slovenia and

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,560
Europe in general to understand that

120
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,840
they business business and and and and

121
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,879
being successful at business it's not

122
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:52,359
mutually exclusive to somebody else uh

123
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:56,000
to someone else's detriment it can be a

124
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,639
win-win situation for for for everyone

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,959
uh my next business I did was the

126
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,759
international canabas business

127
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,478
conference which which is held in Berlin

128
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,680
every year and is the biggest business

129
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,800
B2B business event in the Eastern

130
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,000
hemisphere this is very this is another

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,639
nonplant touching uh business but this

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,959
is also another event that has helped

133
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,199
the community in fact some people have

134
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:22,079
come to me and said Alex without your

135
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,439
event which started in 217 Germany might

136
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,918
not have legalized as or being on the on

137
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,439
the trajectory as quickly as they are

138
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,079
right now I've had many people say that

139
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,240
to me and it warms my heart could I have

140
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,399
had an influence on Germany legal

141
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Expediting their legalization well

142
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,478
that's a very nice nice thing while I'm

143
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,160
making money at my business conference

144
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,918
and helping the community at the same

145
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,400
time these are just two of my examples

146
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,680
of you know econom or you know business

147
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,198
possibilities that when cannabis becomes

148
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,120
legal under uh or policy becomes

149
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,319
modernized under whatever office is uh

150
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,240
because I think I because we're going to

151
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,080
get to what I think syia should do right

152
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,639
now now which seems very clear to me uh

153
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,719
that all these other ancillary

154
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,720
businesses are created and so for the

155
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,560
ICBC the biggest the international

156
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,560
canabas business conference the the uh

157

canab this industry I mean it runs the

167
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,639
gamut you guys would not even uh uh

168
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,439
believe all the different things that

169
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,840
are created when Canabis laws become

170
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,519
modernized in a respective

171
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,758
jurisdiction now what is slovenia's

172
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,198
Advantage this is really something that

173
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,199
I've been thinking about for years um I

174
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,720
knew I was going to move back to

175
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,360
Slovenia 5 six years ago the lockdowns

176
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
happening so that that delayed that a

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,639
little bit but my mind was already I've

178
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,680
already been living in Slovenia for 5

179
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,639
years probably in my mind you know

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,959
incessantly going to NE Ma and looking

181
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,240
at real estate on indala or sty in the P

182
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:13,279
or where or in luano of course you know

183
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,038
I was really I'm really infatuated with

184
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,799
Slovenia I do think it's the greatest

185
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,719
country in the galaxy and so now here I

186
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,879
am and I say well what can we do in

187
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,199
Slovenia here's what we can do look at

188
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,039
this room right here look how look at

189
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,478
the brain power in this room right now

190
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,838
this is amazing we we are we are

191
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,559
Slovenia we are the Revolution and it

192
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,479
really doesn't take much to make what

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,879
most people I think in this room want to

194
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,599
happen happen it's just a little tweak

195
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,918
because we have it already we have brain

196
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,080
power we have AC I'm so impressed with

197
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,600
slovenians how many languages got don't

198
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,440

for for me I'm not because I live in a

206
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,480
lot of places I come from a big city in

207
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,000
America you know you know I've had

208
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,399
crackheads jump me in the middle of the

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,240
night okay it's like can be very

210
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
dangerous in America of course it can be

211
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,000
dangerous here also but no my

212
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,079
12-year-old girl daughter uh our daugh

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,919

215
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,719
Miss

216

leave it's great what an amazing feeling

217
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,360
so we're a special Nation we're a

218
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,838
special people and we could never forget

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,800
that so will we ever be the biggest

220
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,680
producers of cannabis in the world no

221
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,679
probably not will we ever be the biggest

222
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,958
producers of hemp in probably not we

223
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,319
just don't have enough land here right

224
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:53,639
but here's what we can be we can be the

225
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,560
leaders in research and development for

226
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:59,278
the world for canid an Innovative Tech

227
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,199
there's no question about it in my mind

228
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,120
and look at all the research in public

229
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,120
research institutions here today it's

230
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,959
happening we're coming together and yes

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,839
we should liberalize the laws and yes we

232
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,479
should have uh I think medical marijuana

233
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,399
is it's a easy decision we need to when

234
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,720
I hear Dr noow speaking and listen I was

235
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,679
actually crying when Dr noow was

236
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,040
speaking because you know there's how

237
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,799
would you not look at us what if your

238
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,480
kid was sick would you give it wouldn't

239
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,799
you do anything whether it was illegal

240
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,000
or not to alleviate your child's pain we

241
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,958
all would I think and we have in

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,879
situations I think a lot of our parents

243
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,078
when they get older our grandparents and

244
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,240
they die we know we we've helped them

245
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:43,278
with cannabis and some to alleviate

246
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,720
their symptoms to make their last days

247
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,120
better we know this this happens so

248
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,839
there are all these ancillary businesses

249
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,679
that will happen as as Slovenia

250
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,279
modernizes its Canada's policy but the

251
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,559
number one thing I my humble opinion

252
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,600
that I think we can do and Our poise to

253
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,838
do is again be the number one research

254
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,879

255
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,079

258
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,959
