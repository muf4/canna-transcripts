00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,679
I love the fact that Germany is legalizing. I  truly hope that Burkhard, the drug commissioner,  

2
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,559
and the rest of the german government have learned  from the mistakes that Canada's government has  

3
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:34,719
made. I hope that the farmers, the mom-and-pop,  the small shops are all included in legalization.  

4
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
I hope everybody has a chance to  enter, whether it's a 50,000-dollar  

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,280
entry or a 20-million-dollar entry.  I hope that there is an aspect that  

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
everyone can be involved because  it's very very important.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,480
ICBC this year was incredible. All of these  people descended from all over the globe to come  

8
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,640
and witness what is the explosion of  the cannabis industry across Europe.  

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,719
Germany announced it's going rec, and we saw  people coming from Australia, New Zealand,  

10
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,239
Thailand - all over Europe. The United States,  Canada, Uruguay, South America. It's been an  

11
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,359
amazing evolution, and it's a privilege to  be part of it. There's a big spot in this  

12
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,079
particular conference for women's leadership,  and it's just a privilege to be part of it.

13
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,119
Well, it's absolutely the best out of the last  five events that have happened here. I saw  

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,000
almost 2,000 different attendees that were  on this. I saw more countries presented at  

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,879
one event than I had at all these different  conferences internationally, so to talk to  

16
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,359
people from Slovenia, Romania, Ukraine, Colombia,  Peru, Asia, United States - it really brought a  

17
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,560
lot of people together and shared tons of that  wisdom: what's happening good in their markets,  

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
what could happen here for Germany and for Europe.  It's definitely the best international conference  

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,439
I've ever been able to attend here. But now,  with Germany being on the verge of adult-use  

20
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:15,199
legalization as the first and largest GDP nation  in Europe, Berlin's really going to act as the  

21
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,839
hub for that. So, great safe city, beautiful  surroundings, museum island, things to do,  

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,599
but it's best to be in the hub of Europe to  where this is going to get started, so the ICBC  

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:35,840
is really well positioned to uh be the dominant  conference for us for the future here in Europe.

24
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,280
Do I like the after-parties at ICBC? Uh, 100%.  Alex always seems to have amazing guests from DJ  

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,780
mugs to Henry Rollins. I've seen it all. We've  really truly had some amazing after parties in  

26
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:56,000
Berlin, and they set the standard for cannabis  events, and I'm very very grateful for it.
