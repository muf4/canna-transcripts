been coming to Barcelona since 1988 you

34
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,199
know um spent a lot of time here did a

35
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,039
lot of Tours here did a lot of shows um

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,200
we'd be on tour and have three or four

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,759
days off so we'd come to Barcelona you

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,079
know we'd argue Sometimes some of the

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,920
guys would want to be in Amsterdam some

40
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,438
of the guys would be in Barcelona so

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,359
we'd split and then we'd meet up again

42
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,919
in Germany for the next show that's

43
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,759
important to spend time apart from each

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
other when you're on the road like that

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,079
yeah when you have like 10 grown men on

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,879
a on a bus which basically is a

47
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,158
one-bedroom apartment you know I can

48
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,118
only imagine the smell you need a little

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,640
break after when you're on there for 6

50
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:01,000

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
we would smuggle it in from Amsterdam

57
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,199
and we used to put it in the the radio

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,640
and put it in the cassette and put

59

come back and I learned this and I

136
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,839
learned this we need a logo we need a

137
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,600
concept we need this like the first time

138
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,799
they told me do you have a logo I didn't

139
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,160
know what the word was and what it

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,879
meant and what was your concept you know

141
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,639
but I I took all the knowledge I gained

142
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,879

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,839
better you know what I mean cuz we had

255

loving that it's opening up and you know

584
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,558
human beings that would have never

585
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,960
smoked and never thought about smoking

586
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,359
they're smoking it and they're open to

587
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,679
it and it's just beautiful to just see

588
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,959
it opening up globally it's slow it's

589
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,798
going to take some more time it's going

590
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,079
to take a lot of more work but we're on

591
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,430
the right path man we are we are on the

592
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,639
right

593
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,880
[Applause]

594
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,679
path what do you do about I was talking

595
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,440
to somebody uh earlier today about

596
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,280
legalization and regulations and and and

597
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
getting things in and I mean they're

598
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,399
having problems in Barcelona right now

599
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,038
uh a bunch of the clubs were visited by

600
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,679
the police uh last night nobody got shut

601
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:03,480
down but there were some inspections of

602
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,159
things right because they got a new

603
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,558
mayor the new mayor isn't as friendly

604
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,679
toward cannabis as ain't legal but

605
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,158
they're going to come shut you down for

606
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:11,840
a night grab your [ __ ] you open up the

607
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,960
next day you bring it back in and that's

608
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,480
the [ __ ] that's the peek-a-boo game

609
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,600
hide and go seek you know what I mean so

610
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,759
but I feel like there's always going to

611
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,719
be a certain percentage of people that

612
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,200
are just going to hate no matter what

613
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,480
like we can't expect science and common

614
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,679
sense to win the day if we did that we

615
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,640
wouldn't have racism we wouldn't have

616
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,840
abis prohibition if people just believed

617
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,919
in science and common sense so but

618
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,879
there's always going to be a small

619
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,880
amount of of people who just hate weed

620
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,000
no matter what [ __ ] there's

621
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,679
going to be a certain amount of people

622
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,679
that just hate themselves no matter

623
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,599

740
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,319
time seen Cypress back in Toronto um my

741
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:03,640
question is a bit specific if I ever had

742
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,240
a chance to meet you I always wanted to

743
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,278
ask you about the soul assassins album

744
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,759
which I love is such an epic album like

745
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,480
a whole story it tells like from

746
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,038
beginning to end how come more people

747
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,558
don't do that uh it just seems such a

748
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,919
great idea but I haven't really seen

749
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,278
that ever since uh to tell the story

750
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,600
from beginning to end like kind of like

751
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:23,480
a soap opera rap kind of thing it was

752
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:25,199
cool anyways yeah um I think I got two

753
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,880
parts to that I don't know why anybody

754
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,319
doesn't do anything you know what I mean

755
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,200
but my and um but my thing was I just

756
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,720
wanted something to be very cinematic

757
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,200
and and I had like I think 12 different

758
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,839
artists on there and I was like how can

759
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,960
I make this feel like a cohesive piece

760
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,480
of work like and bring it all together

761
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,759
so it didn't sound like a compilation

762
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,278
record or it didn't sound like a mixtape

763
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,879
so you sat down you felt like you was

764
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,278
just listening to an album by One artist

765
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,559
so that's the reason I put it together

766
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:51,839
like that so when you sat down you got

767
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,240
the experience of just you're listening

768
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,839
to One artist and not just a random ass

769
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,519
compilation or soundtrack you know what

770
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,079
I mean I think the challenge on that

771
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:02,278
sometimes too is in the digital age

772
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,000
people don't just put a record on or put

773
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:05,798
a tape on and let it play all the way

774
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,119
through CD in your car and it stays

775
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,839
there for a year right right but now

776
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,359
it's you know your playlist will skip

777
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,038
around all sorts of things so people

778
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,479
think they make singles right they don't

779
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:17,879
necessarily put together you know a

780
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,240
concept album like the soul assassins

781
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,399
album or what's going on from Marvin Gay

782
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,079
or even that sticks album about killroy

783
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,239
or whatever where it's like a whole

784
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,639
story it's everything is so uh people

785
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,640
don't really have the attention span

786
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,520
like they used to except for Alex the

787
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,000
stoner who listens to whole albums all

788
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,558
the way through and and things like that

789
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,200
but yeah there was another question over

790
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,918
here yeah over here can you hear me yes

791
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,038

821
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,159

about some of the new cats but let let

823
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,240
me ask you who were some of your like

824
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,159
influences and not necessarily hip-hop

825
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,399
influences but like musical influences

826
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,080
when you were a younger cat I mean like

827
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:08,639
oh man um Jimmy Hendricks Leed Zeppelin

828
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:10,639
Bob Marley um Ram LZ um rund DMC um

829
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,440
Larry Smith who produced Houdini rund

830
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,600
DMC Public Enemy into like um Picasso

831
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,240
Alejandro jarasi you know people like

832
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:23,199
that like Alejandro jaroski he's a

833
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,399
filmmaker from oh jarasi yeah okay yeah

834
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,558
we were talking musicians you said

835
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,798
filmmaker well that's my inspiration

836
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,398
comes from every place there isn't a lot

837
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:31,000
of music these days that inspires me

838
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,439
anymore I find it outside of Music

839
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,119
things that inspire me you know I read a

840
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,640
juggling book one time and and his

841
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:37,079
advice to juggling performers was don't

842
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,559
be inspired by other jugglers be

843
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,278
inspired by different artists and then

844
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:41,480
incorporate that into your juggling

845
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,319
right so like my comedy show is

846
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,360
definitely set up like a Grateful Dead

847
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,678
concert it's a weird thing but I I feel

848
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,398
what you're saying so like jaroski any

849
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,240
other non-musician influences on your

850
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:53,879
music Picasso you know Picasso is in his

851
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,759
prime in the 60s you know what I mean a

852
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,679
lot of times musicians is like you done

853
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,519
in 30 it's like now we we I'm just

854
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,559
getting I'm not even in my Prime yet you

855
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:03,480
know what I mean we're just working it

856
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:05,759
out you know what I mean you don't see

857
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,399
you you had Killer Mike 48 years old won

858
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,759
three [ __ ] Grammys this [ __ ] you know

859
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:10,359
what I mean the producer of the year was

860
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,879
in his 40s the artist of the year was in

861
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:15,278
his 40s you know what I mean so y'all

862
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
are giving me hope right now a lot of

863
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,720
times the commercial music business is

864
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,159
always looking for the new young hot

865
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,558
thing you know what I mean the one good

866
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,960
thing about the digital age there's a

867
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:24,480
lot of bad things but the good things

868
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,278
about it is I can go direct to my

869
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,640
consumer around the world I don't have

870
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:29,599
to go through a gatekeeper through a

871
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,960
labor through a publicist anymore I

872
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,719
could just touch the people at the

873
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,360
fingertips you know what I mean and I

874
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,360
got 7 billion people right there at my

875
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:38,519
fingertips right now so D I speak

876
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,359
directly to them so it's definitely a

877
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,278
benefit for the Legacy artist in the

878
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:45,359

espanol spell it

966
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,679
oh gracias okay one question for me and

967
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,398
then for real we got to wrap it up we're

968
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,639
over time

969
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,559
I heard that you recently released uh a

970
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,320
wine can you tell us a little bit about

971
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:39,679
the inspiration behind that and oh yeah

972
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm um I'm a big fan of um natural wines

973
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,398
you know I I've always drank wine but

974
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,839
the first time I drank natural wines I

975
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:46,638
was you know a lot of times regular

976
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:48,639
wines might make me tired or something

977
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,599
but I drink a natural wine and I realize

978
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,960
they don't add sulfites to it you know

979
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,599
it doesn't last a long time but they and

980
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,800
um I drank a skin tone which where they

981
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,920
um they leave the skin on it so it was

982
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,640
orange and I never experienced that

983
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,159
before and I was like damn we drank five

984
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,078
bottles and I was with my friends having

985
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,000
a great time I wasn't tired I didn't get

986
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,200
a headache and I go I want to know more

987
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,960
about this so I got a few friends that

988
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,838
are really in really into wine so I was

989
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,000
like let's do a wine project so the

990
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,920
first one I did was called Holy Ghost it

991
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,239
was from an organic wine producer like a

992
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,240
fourth generation organic farm in

993
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,159
Germany it was a petot brought it in we

994
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,879

995
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,399

996
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,920

998
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,480
one called notes and tones and I did a a

999
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,599
