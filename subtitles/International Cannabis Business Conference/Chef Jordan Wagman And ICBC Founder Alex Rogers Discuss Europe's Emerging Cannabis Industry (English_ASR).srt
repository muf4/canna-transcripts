[Music]

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,599
this is actually the first time we are

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:16,559
continuing a theme um the last show it

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,000
hasn't dropped yet but the one that's

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,640
just preceding this one was a couple of

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,439
my friends that we hung out in spain

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,278
together and we attended the icbc and

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
spannabis and you know it was a

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,879
tremendous time and i talked a lot about

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,120
how

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,920
you know similarly how when i went to

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,399
vegas to attend mj biz i ended up

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,280
leaving having said you know and and you

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,840
know all due respect to mj biz but mj

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,679
unpacked was really the show that i i

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
thoroughly enjoyed and brought a lot

17
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,000
more value to my life that's why we

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,280
hosted george j john

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,359
and

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,679
going to spain i thought i was really

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,439
going to spain to attend spanibus and in

22
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,479
truth i was going to spain i ended up

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,679
going to spain and attended the icbc and

24
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,079
so

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,640
the international business

26
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,400
so the international cannabis business

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,560
conference correct alex correct

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,880
all right

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,359
we had the best time at icbc and so

30
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,640
subsequently i had to reach out to alex

31
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:25,599
who is the owner the ceo i'm sure you

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,319
know the the brains behind the icbc and

33
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,839
really try to find out you know

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,679
the

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
certainly the you know

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
what

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,118
the catalyst to wanting to create

38
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,519
something in europe more to be to be

39
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,118
which i'll tell you was something that

40
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,319
for me was

41
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:49,519
a welcome addition to my time in in

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,158
spain um but also really

43
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,560
europe as a whole and what that looks

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,079
like because i had a couple takeaways

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680

off for years uh

93
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,000
to make these conferences i used to do

94
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,798
you know i used to do produce hip-hop

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
shows back in the uh back in the day in

96
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,840
the 90s

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,400
and

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
and i have an event background

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,719
and then uh i just started

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,719
doing this about i started a medical

101
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,878
marijuana clinic in oregon

102
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,719
about 13 years ago and then when they

103
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,399
they legalized in oregon i started

104
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,759
getting all these questions and i was

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,519
like you know what i'm gonna start a

106
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,279
conference and i used some of those

107
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,079
skills that i did just being a hip-hop

108
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,839
producer and did uh weed conference and

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,840
i made like 30 grand off my first

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,159
conference and i was like oh this is a

111
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,399
lot better than the music industry and

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
so uh and so then i just got kind of

113
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,758
hooked and we started doing the

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,720
conferences

115
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
uh

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
basically

117
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,359
all throughout oregon first and we blew

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,720
up in oregon the b2b style and then i

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
then i said well i want to do the

120
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,680
international cannabis business

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
conference i had lived in europe for

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
eight years uh my wife is from slovenia

123
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,000
i spent every summer in europe

124
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,799
uh actually moving there in a couple

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,279
months too and so my dream was always uh

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
to be the

127
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,519
basically

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,800
you know go into europe and be the first

129
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,439
to do and biggest hopefully uh which we

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
became obviously but uh but i i really

131
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,918
had this european vision the whole time

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
that we would get back that i would get

133
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,599
back to europe and i would do something

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,079
special there i used to run the high

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
times cannabis cup back in the day 20

136
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,199
years ago

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,600
over 20 years ago i ran the concert

138
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,520
house the milk veg and so i that was the

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
biggest cannabis event at the time so i

140
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,478
had this kind of this pedigree this

141
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,960
vision this

142
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,478
this life that was kind of if i had if i

143
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,638
worked hard got lucky and did some of

144
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,599
the right things i actually knew that i

145
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,879
could maybe achieve this at the time

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000
fairly grandiose vision

147
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,600
and so

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,918
has the vision evolved a lot since its

149
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,639
inception i mean i s i was reading is it

150
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:54,240
2017 that that was the first show yeah

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,879

153
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,120

international sorry mike and uh uh and

156
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,719

157
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,639
was like we did berlin in 2017

158
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880

mean and they were literally like saying

170
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
that to me by some of my general

171
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,599
partners and i was like well [ __ ] it

172
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,000
we're gonna do it anyway because i

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,080
figured it's all inevitable right if

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,839
it's not me it's gonna be somebody else

175
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,439
and so i just and if i gotta lose a

176
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,758
little money the first whatever this or

177
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,519
that then whatever i'm okay with that

178
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
i'll build the brand and so we did it

179
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,359
and we i booked it in 216 and all sudden

180
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,519
medical blew up in between the time i

181
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
booked the event and the 217 show which

182
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,839
was in i think april

183
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,000
and medical medical just went robust

184
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,918
right in between that time gave doctors

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,319
all this leeway to give put the

186
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,079
pharmacies the insurance reimbursement

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,400
um all this you can do license

188
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,519
production now if uh

189
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,478
this and so 217 berlin basically blew up

190
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,560
so i got kind of lucky that on on the

191
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,038
timing and so

192
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,519
uh and so i actually think things

193
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,199
happened actually quicker than i thought

194
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,959
and then we had the lockdowns and then

195
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,160
there was that the lockdown period where

196
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,318
nothing happened and that that actually

197
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,759
set us back a little bit but not as much

198
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,280
as maybe others and now as we're back

199
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
because because if we kept our brain

200
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,439
going because of pent up demand

201
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,598
we're going through exponent uh

202
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,680
exponential growth right now did you go

203
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,759
virtual at all was any did you did you i

204
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,598
had one virtual event it sucked i'll

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
never do it again it was dope i had rick

206
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,159
steve's keynote i had tommy chung doing

207
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
and dj mugs and ed rosenthal on my smoke

208
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
breaks i mean

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,918
conceptually was okay but it was just so

210
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,638
drab it was like kissing your sister man

211
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,279
it was just the worst thing ever and

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,680
i'll never i mean i just felt dirty

213
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,478
doing it and like i'm a real people

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,478
hands-on guy right and so this virtual

215
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:19,279
thing uh uh as a conference is it really

216
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,120
just hurt my soul and so it was okay to

217
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,000
do for our brand and it went okay

218
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,478
whatever but but for me it was it was a

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,478
painful experience and one that i vowed

220
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,878
i never say never do anything again but

221
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,278
i'm pretty [ __ ] sure i will never do

222
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,680
any online event ever again i don't

223
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,759
think virtual will ever leave my

224
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,519
offering because it's you know it's a

225
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,120
way to connect

226
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,038
please i think it's great no i think

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
it's not great either no it's right

228
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,319
great and now all my meetings were zoom

229
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,319
and i had this more personal connection

230
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,519
where i thought that would have been uh

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,278
uh that where i'm kind of an old

232
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,039
dinosaur before and when i just got on

233
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,879
the phone or whatever i mean and then

234
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,439
the podcast now that here you are don't

235
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,439
get me wrong i love it but for me i i

236
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
mean it's it's it's it's a tremendous

237
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
boom for everybody

238
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,439
but for me personally

239
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
being this guy who's always gathered

240
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
people together

241
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,000
doing it virtually

242
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
is is it just not it's not the same it's

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
like

244
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
through my heart that's how bad it is

245
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,159
for me and i'll tell you something alex

246
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,559
just so you know

247
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,360
what drove that home for me

248
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,479
was because as much as i believe that

249
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,278
virtus as part of virtual experiences

250
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,959
are here to stay but there is no

251
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,200
replacement for getting on a [ __ ]

252
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,759
plane heading to spain going to

253
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
barcelona meeting people from all over

254
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,319
the world going to have drinks going to

255
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,000
smoke some joints go into bond and i'll

256
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,000
tell you something those are friends for

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,240
[ __ ] life they're friends for life

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,679
there's no substitute for that no you

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
said it you said it there's zero

260
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,559
substitute for that and i i create and

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,200
curate these wonderful environments

262
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,679
for that are really you know i'm not a

263
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,560
snob i'm a man of the people if you will

264
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,319
and i hate snobbery and elitism and so i

265
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,039
really like my events to be this like

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,600

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,800
who you know

286
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,959
from pineapple express it's just those

287
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,958
are the type of people you're drawing

288
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,239
and i'll tell you the other one at the

289
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:05,919
top of the list was jim belushi so right

290
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,079
at the top for me was meeting him and

291
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,559
you know and just

292
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,439
realizing exactly what

293
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,559
zoe wilder said he was an approachable

294
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,040
dude you know he's just an approachable

295
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,359
guy and you know what dude you did that

296
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,719
for me and and that's why i wanted to

297
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,278
bring you on the show and i didn't tell

298
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,440
you that in advance but i always talk

299
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,679
about people who positively impact me

300
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,839
because i my goal

301
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,799
is always to positively impact at least

302
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,800
one person a day and you impacted my

303
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,958
life positively and you didn't know that

304
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,120
so i wanted to tell you that

305
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,039
man i appreciate that it's feedback

306
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,799
feedback like that that just keeps me

307
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,639
going and knowing what i'm doing is

308
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,958
right and no one creating this this

309
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,399
culture around the event also

310
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:55,679
is it's just it's just a nice vibe where

311
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,759
people can breathe relax it's not like

312
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,559
it and and it's not like mj biz and

313
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,720
enough respect to mj biz but you really

314
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,638
if you're if you go and even a guy like

315
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
me who's an old industry

316
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,399
head right

317
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,639
if i go to mj biz i'm going to feel like

318
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,159
i'm just i'm the new kid on the block or

319
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,759
i don't have any friends around or

320
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,679
whatever and it's all just this kind of

321
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,958
overwhelming experience

322
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,759
where as

323
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,399
these

324
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,278
more intimate curated events

325
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,759
are

326
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,838
you you feel more of a connection and so

327
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,000
i get a lot of feedback like that and it

328
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,560
really puts wind in my sail and keeps me

329
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,519
going working 15 hours a day every day

330
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,599
so uh i get it so you know i i want to

331
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,440
go back to it but i have to drill into

332
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
your past so there was something that i

333
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880

334
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
quote unquote bringing people to tears

335
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,200
but i you know i think you and i are

336
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,120
going to connect over our stories and

337
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,040
and what brought us to cannabis but we

338
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,879
all inevitably have a story and what

339
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,278
brought us here can you just sort of

340
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,439
look where'd you grow up and you know

341
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,240
and what brought you to cannabis

342
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,560
yeah almost i'm a i'm basically a

343
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
total city kid from minneapolis went to

344
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,879
public schools uh my whole life

345
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,559
graduated from south high

346
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:11,278
um had a pretty multicultural upbringing

347
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,278
uh with my friends and my family

348
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,039
and uh

349
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,958
just loved cannabis i actually had a

350
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,919
disease ulcerative colitis when i was

351
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,359
young

352
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,120
and uh

353
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,360
kind of started smoking cannabis to help

354
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,759
that i eventually found

355
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,360
new ways through food and

356
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:32,838
yoga and identitation and slow stress

357
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,560
lifestyle and ganja

358
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,639
uh and living my life and being free and

359
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,319
happy to cure myself

360
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
um bruce lee says there's no cure i live

361
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
right alongside my disease i don't it's

362
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,519
not encompassing me but i never push it

363
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,680
too far away because i'm always aware of

364
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,159
that and that's a metaphor for uh it's a

365
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,198
great met from the dao of jeep condo a

366
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,679
great metaphor of uh life so i was so i

367
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,078
got way into weed and uh you know i was

368
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,000
really smart student gifted and then you

369
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,679
know i didn't get bad till i got to like

370
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,399
high school right and then i just

371
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,439
started questioning and like doing crazy

372
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,278
[ __ ]

373
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
and then eventually i moved up to

374
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,439
california my girlfriend at the time was

375
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,879
a junior transfer to um

376
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,279
uh uh

377
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,759
sam you see ucsc santa cruz a banana

378
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,958
slug and so i went out to santa cruz in

379
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,078
92

380
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:28,078
and then i met jack hare in 93

381
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:31,519
and then when i met jack that's when i

382
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,759
started working for him um

383
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,120
on his california hemp initiative and i

384
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,120
was doing these other events we did a

385
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,480
human peace chain in lighthouse point in

386
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,799
94. be real from cyprus hill came up the

387
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,560
northridge earthquake was like 10 hours

388
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,359
after that it was just some deep heavy

389
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,679
[ __ ] uh we were pushing hard back then

390
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,320
right so i always believed i i just was

391
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,838
always a fan of cannabis and you know

392
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,760
and then i started singing you know i

393
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,399
started getting into hip hop i was one

394
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,720
of the few white rappers that back in

395
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,720
the day and uh you know well before

396
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
eminem or anything like that and i was

397
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,160
one of the few uh

398
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,000
white rappers that could chant

399
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,519
dancehall right

400
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,480
so so i was so i got into rastafarianism

401
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,919
and drastic culture and nayabingy and

402
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,159
drumming and chanting and uh and it was

403
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,240
all kind of cannabis related right it

404
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,039
was just this whole cannabis world i was

405
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,039
in

406
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,120
and i just loved it and you know rasta

407
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,958
says the healing of the nation

408
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
and so i always figured

409
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,838
uh you know the world's going so one way

410
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,240
and hemp is this way that it's got to be

411
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,000
the right thing and that's kind of what

412
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,278
that's kind of basically how i got

413
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
started with just

414
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,600
hemp activism and hip-hop

415
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,880
and they were too really big they were

416
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,720
really synonymous that's right when

417
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,320
cyprus hill came out and then you

418
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,480
started it was like it was like edgy to

419
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,240
talk about pot back then and uh

420
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,720
and nobody but yet nobody was doing it

421
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,399
because it was still like a little bit

422
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,199
you know you heard you know nice and

423
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,039
smooth had that i left my philly at home

424
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,120
and now i need another

425
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,198
i want to get blood in my brother and

426
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,839
then total devastation took that i want

427
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,519
to get blunted my brother off the off

428
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,079
and then put it to the tribe called

429
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,000
quest sample and so so you're starting

430
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,799
to see it right all these bands that are

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,320
almost like using it as a as a as a

432
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,159
gimmick or it's a real thing in their

433
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,879
life or whatever however it was

434
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:28,240
construed i was right at that time of

435
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,958
when the activism all happened and and

436
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,079
90s hip-hop happened right so this is

437
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,719
before

438
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,399
all the [ __ ] rap took over and we

439
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,759
actually had all this varying different

440
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,519
reps like i worked a lot with

441
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,440
hieroglyphics and delta funky homo

442
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,879
sapien and sold the mischief

443
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,120
and uh worked with alcoholics um

444
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,519
all types of really like uh

445
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,759
amazing crews out there so that's how i

446
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,759
really my love for cannabis is it's not

447
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,919
only just cannabis but it's embedded in

448
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,120
all these other subcultures of america

449
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,958
also

450
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,120
you know often

451
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,119
often times i used to think and i talk

452
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
about this often right like you know

453
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,119
there's not a room i have where there's

454
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,120
no there's not a guitar laying around

455
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,198
but i often used to think i was i i

456
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,198
loved cannabis because i used to love

457
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,199
the

458
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
so you know because i love scarlet

459
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
begonias and the grateful dead that you

460
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,199
know

461
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,839
that was sort of my explanation for my

462
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,279
love of cannabis

463
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,480
like you

464
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,558
i

465
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,120
was diagnosed at 12 years old with

466
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,440
psoriasis and so i spent and the

467
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,119
audience has heard this ad nauseam but

468
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,720
you know as soon as someone mentions it

469
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,399
mentioned this and i didn't realize you

470
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,480
and i were going to connect over you

471
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,360
know our diseases and coming to cannabis

472
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,400
but clearly there's there's this link

473
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,079
um

474
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
you know i i've smoked joints every day

475
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,119
of my life since i was before pre-teen

476
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,840
and and the reason is because i was

477
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,479
diagnosed with psoriasis and i was wake

478
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,159
up

479
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,798
i would wake up every morning with blood

480
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,880
in my sheets and covered in like flakes

481
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,639
and it was just gross and i wrote every

482
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
high school exam in the hospital and

483
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,679
spent a year and a half of my life

484
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,919
sleeping in a tent to the dead sea in

485
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,880
israel like dude i did every [ __ ]

486
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,038
thing i could but until seven years ago

487
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
until i removed gluten dairy and refined

488
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:23,359
sugar from my diet and began consuming

489
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:26,240
cannabis with the intention of healing

490
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,279
myself lowering my inflammation

491
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,038
60 days later my brother 60 days later

492
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,200
30 pounds melted off my body and my

493
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,679
psoriasis got better so for the last

494
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,679
seven years what i do is i build the

495
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,240
narrative worldwide for what cannabis

496
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,880
can be in food and beverage not what

497
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,798
everyone [ __ ] knows or thinks about

498
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,039

so no i mean

502
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,919
that's such a good point and that's the

503
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,359
the rastafarian and when we talk ital

504
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,280
living right

505
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,519

506
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,599
brownie or a gummy and i'm like well

507
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,240
what's in that [ __ ] gummy because if

508
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,558
it's not if it's not honey sweetened

509
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,640
right and if it's not

510
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,240
ng no uh

511
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640

gmos right like like

513
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,559
like the money i spend on food a year is

514
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,960
absolutely ridiculous and i'm always

515
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,960
conscious that that that that

516
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,279
that poor folk don't have these options

517
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,279
and they're in this food desert eating

518
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,519
being poisoned and killed so when lebron

519
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,119
james says black lives matter

520
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,720
and then comes on and does a [ __ ]

521
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,558
mcdonald's commercial the next thing

522
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,200
it is

523
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,200
the brethren

524
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,519
because

525
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,360
it's not it's not

526
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,119
it this the the cannabis is

527
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,599
representative of something

528
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,239
so much greater and that health can turn

529
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,399
this holistic and you have to have it on

530
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,200
all levels refined sugar can be the

531
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,519
worst thing that anyone can [ __ ] eat

532
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,679
in this world it's killing people and so

533
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,679
we send people to mcdonald's so we we

534
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,880
talk about health but we don't talk but

535
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,400
but then we

536
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
we don't ever we see a fast food

537
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,840
commercial on tv and it just goes right

538
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,840
over our head

539
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,599
right and it's all the black people like

540

543
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,679

547
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,640
modiano that was the best paper back in

553
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,559
this is process you know what i'm saying

554
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,360
stay away from some of this soul food is

555
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,960
killing you right so this is this is and

556
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,599
this is totally for poor people in

557
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,000
general but for the black community is

558
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,399
is being uh

559
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,880
and the poor community and the general

560
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,840
american community is being targeted

561
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,840
for destruction through the food

562
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,639
industrial complex and this is nothing

563
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,079
like really you know this is not any

564
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,320
revelatory

565
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,558
thing i'm saying here but i think people

566
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,439
get confused when they when they talk

567
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,038
about healing that just like you say no

568
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,919
dairy no

569
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,440
uh refined sugar take gluten out and

570
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,559
gluten and dairy are okay for some

571
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,480
people but for a lot they're really not

572
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,798
and when you when you take those things

573
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,839
out of your diet um

574
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,079
you know you you food is is the most is

575
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,599
the most important food and sleep are

576
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,879
the two most important things to heal

577
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,399
somebody

578
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,960
and if if and so and so i don't know i'm

579
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,798
you got me excited because this is i'm

580
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
not just here to put a cannabis

581
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,359
conference i believe in legalization of

582
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,360
all drugs right i believe in a

583
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,000
decentralized society built from

584
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,240
community up right and if you're getting

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,359
all your food from everywhere else then

586
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
and you're getting all your everything

587
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,959
from everyone else look what's happening

588
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
now with the supply chain supply chain

589
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,960
oh how did commoditization of everything

590
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,759
work out for us right

591
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,440
so

592
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,599
we have to go back to our communities we

593
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,240
have to eat food that's grown in our

594
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,079
communities and people just are so

595
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,480
disconnected from their bodies and their

596
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,960
souls they don't understand and so it's

597
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,279
up to us for us to to

598
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,360
to bridge that that that gap people who

599
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,119
have healed themselves from diseases you

600
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,798
know we can't i remember there was a

601
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,599
time where i was very disconnected from

602
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:30,798
my body also so we have to have patience

603
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:34,719
for these you know and and understanding

604
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,720
to to just help educate

605
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,599
i i'm just sitting here making notes and

606
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,519
like nodding my head just constantly so

607
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:45,519
a couple of things all about balance

608
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:48,000
love balance i i i i encourage balance

609
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,000
in my life balance doesn't exist where i

610
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,798
eat healthy and then choose to go eat a

611
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,400
big mac it just doesn't doesn't exist

612
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,240
right that's not balanced you balance

613
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
you know you're like okay i had a i had

614
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,919
an organic piece of bread but i still

615
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
had the bread

616
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,200
and so i probably wouldn't even have the

617
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,879
bread because the gluten will destroy me

618
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,240
and i'd love to have a beer but i want

619
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,320
my cheat might be you know what i had

620
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,759
hug and does like i had a spoonful of

621
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,000
hugging does do you know what i mean

622
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,640
like god strike me down for the first

623
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,880
time in five months i've had a spoonful

624
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,840
of hugging does like if that's my

625
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,320
balance that i strike so be it and i

626
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,879
encourage people to strike balance but

627
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:30,240
it's not through mcdonald's because that

628
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,919
is part of a it's not food b it's part

629
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,720
of this what i call this big gulp

630
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,200
culture and and it's just everything is

631
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,120
in excess you know you think about even

632
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,120
these quote-unquote healthier

633
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,158
alternatives you know where i talk about

634
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,319
like cheesecake factory for example

635
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,720
where you go to boca raton and i you

636
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,119
know might we drive up to you know a

637
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,600
power line and we get to boca or the 95

638
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,678
we get to boca we go in we know that we

639
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,519
are standing in line for an hour to get

640
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,679
into cheesecake factory where they're

641
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,759
serving you a portion that every single

642
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,960
person if you are leaving not leaving

643
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,919

644
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,480
huge to-go container for lunch the next

645
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,720
day you've over eaten because the

646
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,278
portion sizes are like for three four

647
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,440
five people but that's what that's what

648
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,679
we teach i mean that's i'm so hardcore

649
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,640
that i'm like on my organic food box if

650
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,559
it says natural flavor i'm like

651
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,520
i won't even buy prepared foods brother

652

right now with them and i don't i have i

655

656
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,960
but there's a company called zen suite

cake mixes you know

660
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,000
snickerdoodles cookie mixes they're

661
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,839
[ __ ]

662
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,400
[ __ ] monk fruit and coconut fruit right

663
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,558
dude i mean maple syrup is my go-to

664
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,519
that's that is my sweetener i'm a tr i'm

665
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,440
a i'm a canadian boy maple syrup when

666
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,359
you reduce it down i can do anything

667
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,320
that i can do with sugar so that and

668
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,639
it's an

669
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:09,038
unrefined sweetener so for me it's

670
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,559
amazing but you know it's it it really

671
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,759
always

672
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,599
drives me crazy and i was one of them

673
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,119
but you mentioned it and maybe i i don't

674
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,278
have your phrasing properly but i'll

675
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,519
paraphrase but like you weren't in tune

676
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,359
with your body i was in tune with my

677
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,679
body and i think many people are in tune

678
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,519
with the body but they've accepted that

679
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,200
hey yeah i'm gonna go out tonight oh

680
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,359
yeah i'll probably have a stomachache

681
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,840
afterwards so i'll bring some antacids

682
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,519
well why don't you just not eat that

683
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,158
food so you don't have to have the

684
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,400
antacid and you know and have this [ __ ]

685
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,760
you know building up inside of you we've

686
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,159
become so immune and numb to the notion

687
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,558
of we eat and then there's a

688
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,960
repercussion it's not supposed to be

689
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,038
that way we're supposed to eat and it's

690
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,519
supposed to nourish us and make us feel

691
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,278
good right right you go to mcdonald's

692
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,278
you have a you have an egg mcmuffin i

693
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,480
haven't had one in decades but i

694
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,079
guarantee

695
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,120
people that eat one they go to the

696
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,798
bathroom in a half an hour and you know

697
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,719
it makes them feel good i have a

698
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,359
nostalgic i have a substitute for every

699
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
nostalgic [ __ ] food i ate when i was a

700
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,038
kid right

701
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,360
so whether it used to be the veggie dogs

702
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,679
or whether it's the the now it's this

703
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,079
type of organic cookie instead of

704
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,640
you know this or that you know i or if

705
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,199
it's a santa cruz coca-cola instead of

706
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,919
uh like i will not eat babylonian food

707
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,558
period to the point of where if it's not

708
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,320
some higher quality product

709
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,079
i won't eat i'll

710
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,240
i won't eat for days if i didn't if i

711
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,000
didn't have you know eventually i would

712
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,759
but it's like you have to have high

713
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,278
quality i'm just in a luxury position to

714
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,038
be conscious enough about it and have

715
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,119
the money to to

716
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,879
to buy this [ __ ] it's all it's all just

717
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,959
you know whole paycheck right so uh

718
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,039
but it's just important to know that

719
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,960
yeah man this is so important and that's

720
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,879
what cannabis represents to me too it

721
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,840
represents that whole entire holistic

722
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,039
spectrum of how we're going to like you

723
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,278
know

724
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,798
you know people do just very like oh i

725
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,720
just had fast food the other day it was

726
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,960
just one two which my dad eats that's it

727
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,120
all the time he's 82 healthy as [ __ ] so

728
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,798
so uh you never know what people's

729
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,558
constitutions are and what they can

730
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,158
handle but uh

731
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,839
but for me personally if i had

732
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,000
mcdonald's one time

733
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,599
i would throw up probably and be sick

734
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,398
i'm not a vegetarian or anything like

735
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,119
that

736
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,639
i'm with you uh wholeheartedly it would

737
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,319
make me sick you know we have something

738
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,880
in canada called clamato juice which is

739
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,759
like just tomato clam juice that we make

740
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,919
that we make caesars with right and i i

741
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,599
and there's nothing that

742
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,440
it's like a you know bloody mary but

743
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,038
it's a bloody caesar and

744
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,080
there's nothing that i can tell you

745
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:48,398
there's no drink i would like more on at

746
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,918
a brunch or anything then a beautiful

747
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,759
like i don't drink anymore because it

748
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,759
kills me but the bloody caesar

749
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,960
specifically there was so much msg and

750
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,000
finally i just said

751
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,840
why am i doing this to myself and i

752
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,240
haven't had it in

753
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,798
20 years whatever it is like i haven't

754
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,319
had clemato juice in 20 years because

755
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,079
you know what becomes you know what you

756
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,158
know what's an addiction more than any

757
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,558
other for me in my life

758
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,039
feeling good alex that's an addiction

759
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,678
for me yeah i think for everybody it is

760
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:20,558
man it takes so much discipline to eat

761
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,120
properly and not have that quick fix you

762
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,639
know and to this day i still do it i

763
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,639
still like potato chips i mean they're

764
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,159
organic potato chips but so what i

765
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,480
shouldn't be eating all that sunflower

766
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,120
oil or sapphire oil right

767
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,640
and uh and still to this day but it's

768
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,639
the same thing for exercise like am i

769
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,200
gonna go do a hundred push-ups after

770
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,440
this thing yeah i'm gonna do it but i've

771
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,080
gotta push myself and i've gotta be

772
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,159
strong and the same things for food but

773
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,119
once you get into that pattern and once

774
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,039
you start to feel good and get that chi

775
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,719
going and get that connection with the

776
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,960
great spirit going or however you want

777
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,640
to call it you're just flowing you're in

778
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,200
you're in your space you're right where

779
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,080
you should be then that's addictive and

780
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,919
then

781
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,319
that's really feeling good so we can

782
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,080
have the quick fix or we can have the

783
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,398
okay i'm going to go take just 10

784
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,398
breaths

785
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:11,679
i'm just going to go do the same

786
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,839
pressing concert just on timber and

787
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,159
after that 10 messages that god damn 10

788
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:19,519
[ __ ] breasts and i feel so good

789
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,360
it's all connected man and i like what

790
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,398
you said about when i started smoking

791
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,839
weed and i did it with health in mind i

792
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,599
think that's a very interesting thing

793
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:30,000
too because everything we have to do has

794
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,240
to be with health in mind we can have

795
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,319
our slips we're humans we're not perfect

796
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,798
but this is the spiritual awakening of

797
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,038
the earth is unless we're tied in with

798
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,879
some type of uh you know we've been

799
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,919
poisoned with all whether it's our water

800
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,080
or our food or the information or we're

801
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,919
being controlled by all these industrial

802
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,678
complexes we always have been it's not a

803
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,360
conspiracy theory it's just to what

804
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,360
degree you think it's happening and how

805
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,918
you think it's playing out right

806
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,158
and and so i think it's happening to it

807
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,120
you know as just on an empirical logical

808
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,520
side

809
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,519
we are being exterminated you know

810
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,278
whether it's a conscious effort or not i

811
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,038
don't know but when you see go to a

812
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,798
grocery store and you see what is

813
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,000
considered to be food

814
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:15,278
you realize that something's gone awry

815
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,640
in our uh society big time and who

816
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,759
suffers from this the poor and

817
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,440
disenfranchised and they're sitting

818
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,759
there and have no chance to go get

819
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,840
anything in their food deserts i mean

820
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,359
it's so easy for you to have one to have

821
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,839
money and be able to be like oh i got

822
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,398
mine i got mine we have to be attenually

823
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,319
conscious of what's going on of the pain

824
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,558
and suffering around the world and it

825
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,720
doesn't mean we have to be depressing or

826
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,960
ruin our day we'd still be optimistic

827
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,798
and very happy but we have as a taoist

828
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,798
you have to have some type of

829
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,200
of consciousness of what

830
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,519
of the whole picture man because that's

831
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,679
what that also would you say the middle

832
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,599
path buddha says right

833
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,038
so i'm not a food nazi i don't want

834
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,119
anyone to do this or that they can do

835
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,599
whatever the [ __ ] they want right

836
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,359
uh but uh i'm not trying to mandate

837
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,158
anything it's a freak it's a free world

838
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,959
right

839
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,000
but uh but that middle path is so

840
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,159
important for everything and for healing

841
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,640
i think the middle path is i think we

842
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,159
live in such a manic culture

843
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,679
uh oh yeah yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah oh yeah

844
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,679
selfie whatever yeah

845
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,519
that there's that the laws of the

846
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,679
universe say well you're going to have

847
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,720
those same lows too

848
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,360
you know

849
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,360
and so you and so the real happiness is

850
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:33,678
that ribbon in the middle

851
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:36,000
where that nirvana of source uh resides

852
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,320
not too high not too low right like it's

853
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,558
you know it's that's like baby baby

854
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:43,119
bears porridge

855
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,278
it's that's exactly right the perfect

856
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,798
temperature that that i mean that's that

857
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,960
is exactly right

858
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,679
you know you oh we're digressing aren't

859
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,840
we

860
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,880
no no not at all because i'll tell you

861
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:57,119
not at all not at all and we are i i

862
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,240
wasn't expecting not that i wasn't

863
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,079
expecting this to be so good but i

864
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,278
wasn't expecting it to go in this

865
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:08,398
direction because we are so aligned

866
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,720
music saved me like music i know that

867
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,879
cannabis helped to heal me but music

868
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,480
saved me and what i mean by saying that

869
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,159
is i've struggled with mental health

870
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,480
it's really hard to have an autoimmune

871
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,640
disease or any chronic illness and not

872
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,159
struggle with mental health and so you

873
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,320
know combining that with watching a

874
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,320
friend of mine die and i have still you

875
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,119
know dreams of the bloodstained docks at

876
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,119
summer camp um you know my grandfather

877
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,879
having died a month before that it was

878
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,000
you know when i was 13 years old and

879
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,840
truly that impacted my entire life

880
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,759
um you know it it wasn't until i went to

881
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,240
this school called the jerome d diamond

882
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,720
adolescence center here in toronto and

883
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,120
uh it's a school of 30 kids

884
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,720
and i was the eldest at 16 and it was

885
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,558
for kids that couldn't you know hack it

886
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,519
in the mainstream school system right

887
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,599
and so it's social emotional educational

888
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,120
you know behavioral issues whatever the

889
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,439
case may be

890
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,079
and music saved my life you know they i

891
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,080
had started to play guitar at 13 and and

892
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,158
finally they said like instead of you

893
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,079
know punching it hurts a lot less for

894
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,278
you too instead of punching the wall why

895
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,558
don't you just go pick up that

896
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,000
instrument right there and play the

897
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,480
[ __ ] guitar

898
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,640
and i remember that one of the first

899
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,919
songs i learned um like to really cry to

900
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,880
and and sort of be in the moment with

901
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,919
was wild horses

902
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,159
was wild horses

903
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,640
yeah and so but but i'll tell you like

904
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,320
for me it's just music

905
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,320
you know it's uh

906
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,319
doobies said music is the doctor right

907
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,240
like music was the doctor for me the

908
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,200
music that makes me cry is bob marley

909
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,798
and jamiroquai

910
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,080
dude jamiroquai is one of the all-time

911
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,720
best

912
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:56,000
ever i mean like one of the most

913
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,240
distinct sounds and voices right that's

914
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,679
what makes it so unique his voice is

915
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,519
insane

916
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,679
yeah no they're just so funky and they

917
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,440
were like retro at the time almost right

918
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,559
they were bringing this little retro 70

919
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,280
sound in

920
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,679
and but they had their own thing uh also

921
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,919
but yeah music has been very inspiring

922
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,200
uh i think i don't know if it saved me

923
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,759
it's always been a part of my life

924
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:21,439
because i grew up in a musical family

925
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,599
but uh but it's a music is the it's it's

926
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,159
it's such a beautiful art that you can

927
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,720
express anywhere at any time

928
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,398
and uh you know

929
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,398
i loved it i found it challenging people

930
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,638
used to always say wasn't it hard being

931
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,878
a white rapper being a rapper who was

932
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,878
white back in the you know the early 90s

933
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,039
or whatever i said no it's the best

934
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,838
because as an artist you want to stand

935
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,559
out

936
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,239
exactly you want to differentiate

937
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,838
i was like yeah was i getting hate

938
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,000
that's why i switched to that's why i

939
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,759
switched to learn dance hall because i'd

940
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,440
be going up to big crowds that were all

941
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
black and they'd just and i'd be

942
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,320
wrapping my face off and they'd just

943
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,079
it'd just be all stone faced in the

944
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,480
crowd like you know who's this white boy

945
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,560
up there right and i was like

946
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,639
how can i win the crowd over so i

947
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,358
started chanting dancehall jamaican

948
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:09,920
style right and that became my secret

949
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,400
weapon to get over so i always had these

950
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,280
little things in music that i would like

951
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
it was

952
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,240
i mean it was performing was was always

953
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,400
my favorite thing to do

954
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,679
and i performed all over did all types

955
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,800
of crazy [ __ ]

956
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,598
um uh but how did it save you man like

957
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,680
how do how what do you mean like like

958
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,160
like you said because i

959
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,239
yeah it absolutely did like i you know i

960
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,799
i thought about killing myself when i

961
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,959
was very young um you know having this

962
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,920
disease everyone thought

963
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,519
you know there was always this

964
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,320
misconception

965
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,239
um you know even today people look at me

966
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,680
and they're like you know you got it so

967
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,919

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,760
i

973
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,720
i'm very specific in my social media to

974
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,119
not curate something that says hey look

975
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,078
at me i'm happy that's not what it's

976
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,280
about

977
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,359

sixth book is coming out in you know

984

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
couple weeks like no one resonates with

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,838
that who look who's written in multiple

987

989
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,879
wants to attend in europe not many

990
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,039
people can resonate with that type of

991
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,358
success but they can resonate with our

992
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,519
struggles you know being arrested at the

993
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,000
border and [ __ ] you know uh

994
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,719
burlington vermont when i was going to

995
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,159
you know in college for a point three of

996
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,399
a gram i don't even know if i've ever

997
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,759
told that story on here but the long and

998
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,358
short of it was i didn't get into

999
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,599
trouble because i'm an american citizen

1000
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,319
they actually only gave my buddies who

1001
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,880
were canadian citizens all the hassle in

1002
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,480
the world um but they confiscated the

1003
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,280
car for 0.3 of a gram of hash and

1004
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,119
yeah dude it was [ __ ] brutal but like

1005
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
you know it's that sort of stuff where

1006
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,119
people just you don't see

1007
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,199
you know they don't they it's like the

1008
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,720
iceberg right they only see what's above

1009
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:22,319
the world no that's like that's so funny

1010
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:23,598
because when i do these shows let's say

1011
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,280

1013
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,480
call it being king for a day

1014
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,879
because because my life here i'm just a

1015
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,400
family man with my wife and my daughter

1016

1018
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,480

1026
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,280
year

1027
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,320
maybe you could be king for a a day

1028
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,839

and so i'm always it's just so good to

1031
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,199
stay humble and not get souped

1032
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,519
on on once you do that you know the

1033
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,639
great spirit does not [ __ ] like that

1034
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,679
you know

1035
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:16,559
you know you know you know i i was on uh

1036
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,519
i told the story i posted a story today

1037
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:21,199
on linkedin and i rarely you know not

1038
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:24,559
rarely that's not even fair now because

1039
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,719
i am using linkedin more and more but

1040
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,320
last week i received an email the long

1041
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,078
and short of it is this i have a

1042
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,800
relationship with sick children's

1043
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,039
hospital here in toronto okay and the

1044
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,640
reason i have a relationship is because

1045
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,119
in my high school career i wrote every

1046
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,199
high school exam in the hospital twice

1047
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,119
at sick children's hospital so i spent

1048
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,960
you know almost six months of my life

1049
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,920
there as an inpatient

1050
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,440
and i always said like you know once i

1051
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,200
had the the the means to give back and

1052
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,760
it wasn't through money it was through

1053
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,919
raising funds and through my time that i

1054
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,640
wanted sick kids to be the recipient of

1055
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,280
some of those those efforts

1056
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:05,440
and i started a relationship i built a

1057
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,119
relationship with pact pediatric

1058
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,559
advanced care team right so it's kids

1059
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,960
that are not going to live a very long

1060
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:15,440
life and that are very sick and one kid

1061
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,679
passed away corey groves on october 20th

1062
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,119
october 31st 2020

1063
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,838
and then i was introduced to this young

1064
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,800
man paul who i didn't

1065
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:27,039
for whatever reason i went to spain i

1066
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,839
was in florida cooking i was in jamaica

1067
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,920
like i just life got in the way and i

1068
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:32,880
went to reach out to his mom last week

1069
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,320
and

1070
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,838
he passed away

1071
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,400
and you know it's it's that sort of give

1072
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,119
back it's that sort of willingness to

1073
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,559
get

1074
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,800
that's going to haunt me for the rest of

1075
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,358
my life i will tell you and i put it out

1076
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,039
there to everyone you know so

1077
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,559
basically the point of me saying that

1078
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,519
was and and telling the story this

1079
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,880
morning was seize the moment

1080
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,880
i know what the point man

1081
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,839
yeah there's so much pain and suffering

1082
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:04,639
in the world that all this we're going

1083
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:07,119
to judge each other and be pissy and and

1084
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,279
stand on pedestals this garbage is the

1085
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,760
most it's the most hateful racist

1086
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,119
misogynistic xenophobic attitude it just

1087
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,359
doesn't matter

1088
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,838
it just doesn't matter you know i lost a

1089
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,920
buddy he killed himself in 2021. he

1090
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,920
didn't take his artwork with him or any

1091
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,680
of his money or anything like

1092
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,838
you you take

1093
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,679
the impact that you've had on other

1094
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,279
people with you that's it

1095
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,199
that's it

1096
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,440
such earthly problems most people want

1097
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,719
to get all up in the dither about and

1098
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,880
right

1099
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,118
and then you just oh there's so much my

1100
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,440
mother passed away for about four years

1101
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,599
ago and since that happened you know i

1102
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,920
was thought you know there's a you know

1103
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,920
it's extremely difficult

1104
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,639
but uh she was amazing and my best

1105
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,440
friend but what it actually made me a

1106
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:56,000
better person all that pain

1107
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,960
and suffering it makes you a better

1108
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,960
person if you are if you're uh if you're

1109
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,800
if you're if your chakras are open to

1110
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,280
receiving and giving like that you're

1111
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,800
light you're it's moving because all

1112
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,160
that pain and suffering should just make

1113
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,079
one have more patience understanding

1114
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,920
and understanding and tolerance for

1115
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,720
other of other people

1116
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,720
and this is the only direction we can we

1117
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,480
can go all this

1118
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:24,078
knee-jerk [ __ ]

1119
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,280
reductive rhetoric is dangerous and and

1120
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,200
and and

1121
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,599
and it's only the person that's

1122
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,519
espousing it that's suffering right like

1123
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,599
when i see some [ __ ] out there in

1124
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,679
babylon you know it's just i'm just like

1125
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,359
oh man you are like uh

1126
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,799
you know i'll pray for you basically now

1127
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,440
if he's a dick to me i might punch him

1128
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,280
in the face too right it could happen

1129
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,800
i'll walk away or i'll punch him in i'll

1130
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,839
walk away

1131
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,280
but if i have to i'll punch him in the

1132
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,880
face because some people you just get

1133
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,359
what you're coming you just get what's

1134
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,240
what's just you're a dick you deserved

1135
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,239
it

1136
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,000
but on a higher level it's like you know

1137
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,519
you got to have love and understanding

1138
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,358
standing some people need a little punch

1139
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,280
in the face every now and then

1140
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,519
and uh just kind of a wake-up call

1141
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,040
whether it's whether it's

1142
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,079
figurative or literal

1143
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:11,119
uh

1144
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,960
uh

1145
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,119
uh you know the things that people are

1146
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,358
complaining and talking and the greed

1147
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,000
the avarice the paciousness that's

1148
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:22,239
running our society right now and just

1149
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,199
if if you're a [ __ ] if you're not a

1150
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,479
greedy adverse rustic [ __ ] right

1151
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,000
i don't know if everything's a word but

1152
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,960
i like it um

1153
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,519
uh

1154
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,240
you're a [ __ ] right and so if you're if

1155
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,719
you're

1156
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,799
if you're in you're soft right it's get

1157
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,358
or be got well we're not animals we're

1158
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,119
humans and we get to make diff different

1159
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,279
different choices so the people in

1160
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,519
charge with all these wars not just

1161
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,560
putin the west all the [ __ ] west wars

1162
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,960
also

1163
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,519
it's a joke these we have children

1164
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,760
running the we have complete

1165
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,000
like eight-year-old ten-year-olds would

1166
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,680
get on better than these the the adults

1167
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,838
in the world right now

1168
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,399
so uh so here's the culture and the

1169
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,358
narrative that's being foisted upon the

1170
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,400
kids today and whatever it is and we're

1171
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,400
missing the point where people who are

1172
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,800
are trying to be tolerant are the most

1173
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,119
intolerant people in the in the world

1174
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,800
these days and [ __ ] is upside down of

1175
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,440
course i have a lot of other opinions on

1176
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,079
on that also why that is but we won't

1177
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,960
get into that but the the bottom line is

1178
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,280
love

1179
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,519
patience tolerance

1180
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,119
understanding and if the time comes to

1181
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,159
get a punch in the face

1182
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,838
then

1183
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,559
you did your part you did your part

1184
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:37,599
until that point you know i hope that

1185
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,920
there is you know i i i subscribe to

1186
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,640
karma i i believe that you make your own

1187
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,838
success uh working hard as you said you

1188
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,519
know i've been speaking to someone

1189
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,920
a lot of what i do is on a fractional

1190
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,960
basis uh these days i don't really want

1191
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,358
to give anyone 100 of my time and you

1192
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,119
know when i explained to them you know

1193
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,639
you're probably unemployable anyway

1194
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,599
jordan you're you're too much your own

1195
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,799
person

1196
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,640

1198
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,960

1201
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,960
do those

1202
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,519
um you know liz you know i

1203
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,960
i want to i have to get back to the icbc

1204
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,559
before we go on because we're going to

1205
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,199
run out of time and i i need to know

1206
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:26,239
what's next for the icbc because yeah

1207
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:29,279
this thing has you know if you haven't

1208
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:32,559
been i highly suggest that you go

1209
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,160
um there is nothing that i i certainly

1210
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,119
know

1211
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:39,838
what spannabis is doing is wonderful

1212
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,720
it's just it was very clear to me

1213
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:45,279
where the culture is like how nascent it

1214
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,919
is you know there's you know i i was

1215
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,319
with a lot of women and uh

1216
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,240
at spannabis and icbc but spannabis

1217
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,519
specifically and there was nothing and

1218
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,279
because i'm in the health and wellness

1219
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,800
space too i'm a little bit of a unicorn

1220
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,880
and that

1221
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,119
it's mostly women in the space that i'm

1222
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,079
in and speaking to there was nothing

1223
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,318
that spoke to our space at spannabis

1224
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,599
zero nothing nada

1225
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:11,920
and uh that was a missed opportunity i i

1226
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,599
thought um spanish is what it is it's

1227
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,559
always it's the longest running consumer

1228
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,240
event

1229
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,679
it's always going to be what it is it's

1230
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,039
always going to have its value and

1231
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,519
utility

1232
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,239
however the b2b thing in europe is

1233
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,639
blowing up uh we were the first b2b in

1234
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,919
europe we're uh we're the biggest in

1235
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,838
europe uh we're only in europe now so

1236
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,838

1242
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,440
to uh focus only on europe because not

1243
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,199
only was that where our brand was

1244
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,920
blowing the [ __ ] up

1245
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,078

1246
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,358
wanted to be and it's where i actually

00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:02,318
anyway right so i found this place in

1305
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:05,519
croatia jordan oh my god it is insane

1306
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:08,079
dude it's the craziest [ __ ]

1307
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,519
ever and i'm not just saying that to

1308
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,039
like the event it's going to be only 200

1309
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,759
people we're going to sell the event out

1310
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,519
you know but i'm saying this [ __ ] is so

1311
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,040
crazy it's right on the sea it's croatia

1312
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,119
it's on this it's like rick steve's

1313
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,358
favorite town romaine and they just have

1314
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,280
this new hotel the park hotel like

1315
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,519
swimming all these swimming pools

1316
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,200
and all these it's like a six star hotel

1317
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,838
it's the craziest thing the food is all

1318
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:32,719
farm to table right at the hotel it is

1319
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:36,799
absolutely in stunning like move over

1320
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:39,358
greece france italy come to the croatian

1321
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,880
adriatic and you'll be no more good

1322
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:42,239
straight up one of the reasons i get

1323
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,400
these fancy

1324
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,919
places is because the stigma of cannabis

1325
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,519
too i'm going into croatia it's very

1326
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,838
conservative there

1327
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,800
and i think if i rent the most expensive

1328
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,558
most pimped out hotel in the nation

1329
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,480
that it helps me just like i did for

1330
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,880
switzerland with the dolder grand finest

1331
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,719
hotel in zurich right yeah i like fine

1332
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,280
[ __ ] right whatever but there's a method

1333
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:04,879
to the madness would go in

1334
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,960
and then you could then we bring in

1335
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,318
people like politicians from croatia

1336
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,960
that they wouldn't be coming to do it if

1337
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:13,279
you're at the motel 6 or whatever right

1338
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,280
but you're at the baddest hotel in the

1339
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,960
nation and then they're coming in

1340
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,519
representing so

1341
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,559
so so you heard it here first the

1342
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,599
icbc mediterranean retreat roving

1343
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,839
croatia 22nd and 23rd

1344
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,760
amazing and and you know you talk about

1345
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:31,920
you know a couple things have resonated

1346
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,680
with me you know empathy goes a very

1347
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,039
long way um in life but the fact is is

1348
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:38,399
that for us

1349
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,239
what we're doing having these

1350
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,559
conversations you

1351
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,358
um you know having these conferences and

1352
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,839
and

1353
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,480
and renting higher end establishments

1354
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:51,199
and associating you know higher-end

1355
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,760
brands and higher-end culture with the

1356
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:55,598
you know with cannabis i mean obviously

1357
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,920
the parallel is that's what i do for a

1358
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,000
living and and ultimately it's about

1359
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,079
destigmatizing the plan and when people

1360
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,318
see someone like us that whether

1361
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,200
creating curating these experiences

1362
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,880
eating my food and recognizing that holy

1363
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:10,960
[ __ ] that brownie has cannabis and it

1364
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,119
has avocado and it has coconut oil and

1365
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,400
almond flour and cacao in it and it's

1366
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,640
really good for me and it's really

1367
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,680
[ __ ] tasty and in in like i can eat

1368
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,558
like this

1369
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,318
you know it's it's all about

1370
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,440
destigmatization and i'll sort of you

1371
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,440
know

1372
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,039
for me the biggest opportunity and i

1373
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,400
keep talking about this the biggest

1374
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:33,039
opportunity in cannabis alex is from a

1375
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
set especially from a cpg standpoint but

1376
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:34,960
you know

1377
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,400
is

1378
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,240
are the people that don't currently

1379
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,960
consume cannabis that's the biggest

1380
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,598
opportunity how do we bring them because

1381
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,318
they're all kind of curious many people

1382
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,920
are really really curious about cannabis

1383
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,838
you know what they're not going to do

1384
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,760
they're not going to grab the ziggy's

1385
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,119
they're not going to grab the raws and

1386
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,119
we're not going to give them flour and

1387
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,119
say go roll a joint or anything

1388
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,960
combustible we're going to do it through

1389
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,640
food and beverage

1390
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,720
you know the cool thing is so i'm in

1391
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:03,440
oregon right southern oregon basically

1392
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:05,199
the

1393
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,000
one of the weak capitals of the world

1394
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,358
right

1395
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,358
so there's nothing for me to teach

1396
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,078
anybody here anymore i actually helped

1397
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,759
revolutionize medical marijuana here in

1398
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,839
the valley i helped this valley

1399
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,160
tremendously um became a strong

1400
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,719
community member and proud of my work

1401
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,239
but now there's nothing there's is

1402
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,399
there's no more but when i'm in [ __ ]

1403
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,318

1404
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,079
catholics and [ __ ] and maybe associated

1405
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:31,279
with some type of form of

1406
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,359
religious temperance uh uh and here i am

1407
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,119
talking to them i pride myself on

1408
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,558
engaging them and being very clear and

1409
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,400
articulate and just like you say you

1410

1412
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,639
i'm a magna [ __ ] uh summa [ __ ] laude

1413
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,318

1414
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,879

1415
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,039
don't say that to to tout myself or i

1416
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,680
say that to make this point that i'm a

1417
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,519
full [ __ ] stoner like of the utmost

1418
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,440
actually i'm euro trash now for since i

1419
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,838
lived in europe so i just smoked with uh

1420
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,119
tobacco and ash right so it is a more

1421
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:02,960
functional way to smoke it's not like

1422
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,240
i'm doing big dab hits or anything but

1423
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,440
but it doesn't matter because europeans

1424
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:07,439
only smoke one way and that's with

1425
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,200
tobacco so i tell them all i smoke every

1426
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,318
day and so many of them are like yeah

1427

00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,000
i'm like

1430
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,000
don't believe the hype and that's then

1431
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,440

00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,039
of my life it's how i treat myself it's

focused and become and

1452

maintain or or really

1453
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:12,719
once i found my mental health through my

1454
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,720
physical health i became a much more

1455

1458
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,639
better way better for me and so you know

1459
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,559
cannabis when i started to realize that

1460
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:29,279
you know it wasn't because i was only

1461
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,240
you know a deadhead or you know it was

1462
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,480
because i needed it to survive and it

1463
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,159
took me decades to realize right well

1464
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,400
like you said well jack herron never

1465
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,759
smoked weed till he was 30.

1466
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,119
right so a lot of people don't know that

1467
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,400
but but like you said there's an

1468
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,760
application for

1469
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,200
everybody like or there's all these

1470
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,920
curious people and there's an

1471
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:50,159
application for everyone now some people

1472
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,240
just don't want to smoke and get high on

1473
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,239
thc smoke and joint

1474
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,439
some people just don't like the feeling

1475
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,118
and

1476
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,119
that's fine but there's still an

1477
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,480
application for them to use cannabis

1478
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,039
absolutely

1479
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,039
micro edible or whether it's a lotion or

1480
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,119
topical or whatever the [ __ ] it is and

1481
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,039
there might be a certain time where they

1482
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,960
might have a certain ailment with then

1483
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,480
they only use it then like my wife

1484
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,400
doesn't smoke at all ever but when she

1485
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,318
gets sciatica pain she takes a puff off

1486
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,079
that vape maybe once or twice a year

1487
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,079
only and she said it helps her go to

1488
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,599
sleep and it helps her and she's totally

1489
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,200
not pot head like or you could put

1490
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,200
terpenes in

1491
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,919
or you put terpenes into a diffuser i

1492
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:29,838
mean something as simple as that

1493
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,400
you know something as simple as that so

1494
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:35,519
that misconception that cannabis

1495
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,358
cannabis equals getting high right so so

1496
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,599
in europe see how exciting it is for me

1497
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,679
because it's still so stigmatized you're

1498
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,000
thought of like you can't it's like you

1499
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:44,960
thought of like some lazy lazy loser

1500
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,119
still

1501
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,039
uh and they'll think that's really a big

1502
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,440
threat even in germany or whatever and

1503
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,599
that's just starting to crack and we're

1504
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,920
i love helping that i can say i'm a

1505
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,760
