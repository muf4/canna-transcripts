1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,120
well hello everybody it's great to be

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,650
here hope you had a great morning and so

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,879
our panel today is mainstreaming of CBD

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,190
so how does the product become a

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,170
mainstream product one might ask it

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:18,198
generally starts with the trend that in

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,990
the best case goes mainstream a

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,090
particularly strong trend is a hype

9
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:27,868
which is the situation we have with CBD

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:30,210
currently but will the current CBD hype

11
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,429
turn into a sustainable consumer trend

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,259
that is going to be one of the questions

13
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,960
we have for today but before we delve

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:39,869
into it the four panelists will

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,239

basically legal to have every kind of

27
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,429
cannabis plant it doesn't matter if it's

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,390
a CBD or THC genetic and this is what we

hemp farmer hemp is company from

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,049
ljubljana slovenia we say for our

34

company that we control from the seats

35
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,210
fills to the final consumer products and

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,118
we are considered to be one of the most

37
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:45,599
innovative company in developing

38
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:47,670
healthcare products based on CBD hello

39
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,828
I'm Kyle Kahneman from part of on

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,859
Germany I'm a lawyer I'm in the field

41
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:55,408
since two years and I'm consulting CBD

42
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,769
and medical cannabis companies in all

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,840
regulatory and legal issues well that

44
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,140
was great let's delve right into it then

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,500
so so CBD is taking the world by storm

46
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,560
but one has to ask the question who is

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,659
the consumer behind this demand Chris

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,848
what do you think is there a typical CBD

49
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,739
consumer out there

50
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:18,078
this is probably the hardest question of

51
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:21,799
the afternoon because our demographic is

52
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:24,049
anybody 8 to 80 any mammal almost right

53
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:26,810
that can take CVD right because they all

54
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:29,510
have an endocannabinoid system so is the

55
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,579
app who's the average consumer anyone

56
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:33,828
with an endocannabinoid system however

57
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:35,540
we have to develop individual products

58
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:37,400
that speak to those individual needs in

59
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:38,810
those individual voices so it's more in

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,370
the delivery system the marketing and

61
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,650
the messaging that we're able to fit

62
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,319
those individual needs from a European

63
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,010
perspective Roman and Philip would you

64
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:52,848
agree yes I will agree because there's

65
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:55,969
no typical CVD consumer everybody buys

66
00:02:52,848 --> 00:03:01,668
it so we regulate ourselves to sell the

67
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:04,818
product at age 18 but from from 18 to 80

68
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:07,400
you have everybody the younger people

69
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:10,429
maybe bite for muscle regeneration or

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,599
anything and all the guys come for aroma

71
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:17,780
and also talks next and and and these

72
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:20,780
things are sold so it's a very bright

73
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,759
bright consumer Roman do you have

74
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,729
anything to add our experience is

75
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:28,189
actually the same because but what while

76
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:30,409
we were a bit surprised we have our

77
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:34,039
internet portal sales and we were

78
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:36,019
measuring some aging so it is only to

79
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,840
present ourselves but our average

80
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:42,500
consumer was 35 years old which was to

81
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,389
me surprising young so we have all these

82
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,699
consumer types all these different

83
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:49,819
products new product developments are

84
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:51,760
rapidly increasing so let's take a step

85
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:54,619
back how would you cut carrot and

86
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,688
categorize it how would you give a

87
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,669
beginner friendly take on all these

88
00:03:56,688 --> 00:04:03,228
products which categories do we have

89
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:06,319
maybe Philip or Chris it's how Chris

90
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:10,519
told before it's more a thing former

91
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,798
from marketing because it depends to the

92
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,840
customer we also have two grannies which

93
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,150
comes in and you think maybe the

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,009
capsules or the oil are best for her but

95
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:24,259
she's asking for flowers for smoking

96
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:26,930
this also can happens so I think how he

97
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,709
said you should place in the development

98
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,879
some

99
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:31,459
products for different types of

100
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,269
consumers but you never can say that

101
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:37,909
this is fixed so we focus on delivery

102
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:39,978
systems we want to make sure you get the

103
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,470
most amount of high-quality CBD for the

104
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:44,478
high quality people we use a liposomal

105
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,130
product to make sure that it you feel

106
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,949
the effects really fast for those that

107
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:50,089
need those right away we have a topical

108
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,250
for those that want to put it on that

109
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,019
way we have capsules because people are

110
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,699
just used to taking pills you know we

111
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,348
want to make sure that you develop the

112
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,329
way in the delivery system that you're

113
00:04:57,348 --> 00:05:02,750
going to get the most impact in the way

114
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:04,459
that you'll take it if you look at the

115
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,970
production method and all these

116
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:10,758
different types of intakes what you can

117
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,919
have with CBD do you have to think then

118
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,729
I'm gonna produce it like this to this

119
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:21,288
mean or does it not matter in any case

120
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:23,508
maybe Roman we have different sort of

121
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:26,300
production depending on our final

122
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:29,598
product for example I don't know we are

123
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,449
now stressing for example creams with

124
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:35,329
glucosamine for the joints you know this

125
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:39,288
is special technique is all the recipe

126
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:41,569
and then we have special I would say Co

127
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:43,519
partner with the GMP facilities so you

128
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:45,800
know each product is a bit unique and

129
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,019
what we learned for is also with all the

130
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,930
consumer products stability studies are

131
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:54,680
quite demanding so we have to be really

132
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,408
I would say focusing and really takes

133
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,329
time it's not that easy

134
00:05:56,408 --> 00:06:01,490
so the demand we heard is rapidly

135
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,379
increasing at which rate is it

136
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,620
increasing would be my first question

137
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,439
and also is it possible to meet this

138
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,968
demand as a single supplier I mean

139
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,769
obviously we have a u.s. perspective in

140
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:15,439
the European perspective on this but can

141
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:18,799
you give any insight to how rapid this

142
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,649
demand is I can see Roman I mean I can

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,120
tell in our case our company last year

144
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:29,629
grew times 3 almost times 4 of course we

145
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,329
new categories new lines and coping with

146
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,189
this is you know managing your working

147
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:37,668
capital

148
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:39,709
having the right capacities well-planned

149
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:42,829
for us is also important I would say

150
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:44,930
traceability continuty so will it trace

151
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:47,688
each product so in building is at the

152
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:51,079
same time so it takes really all the

153
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:53,120
resources of the company because you

154
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,199
know you can do if you do something fast

155
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,009
you can do it wrong

156
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,348
this was our experience so we're a

157
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,968
global company and we're deliver to 42

158
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:04,399
different countries so our perspective

159
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:07,848
globally is that we've secured source

160
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,649
for five to six times our growth from

161
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:12,110
last year which was five to six times

162
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:15,799
the year before so we're absolutely

163
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:20,569
looking to be able to supply the the

164
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,340
increase in demand that seems by best

165
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,770
aspects everyone's saying somewhere

166
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,318
between 16 and 20 million in the next 30

167
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:31,549
years is billion in the next 23 years

168
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,050
which is I'm in a matchable number when

169
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,168
you realize that just last year it was

170
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:40,699
only a billion right and I feel weird

171
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:42,680
saying only a billion but 22 billion is

172
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,240
a lot bigger than that so everyone has

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,009
to scale and everybody has to grow and

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,588
that's why everybody in this room has an

175
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,669
opportunity to really be a part of that

176
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:53,060
Philip have you got anything to add from

177
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:56,000
your perspective yes for sure I can say

178
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,129
the demand is rising up very fast it's

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,228
also I think because of the media the TV

180
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,479
and so on because people get informed

181
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:07,158
about cannabis again it's coming back

182
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:10,188
through to the humans and also the the

183
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:13,069
guys talk to each other and we see a lot

184
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:18,139
of times the customers come in our shop

185
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:19,310
and they are informed before because we

186
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,740
are not allowed to give some health

187
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,990
claims or anything the CBD but they know

188
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,870
it before they come so you see about the

189
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,028
internet the media or anywhere they hear

190
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,459
about and they want to try it and eight

191
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:34,429
from ten come again and buy again so

192
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,408
this is a nice rate maybe also a

193
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,750
question for you directly now Philips so

194
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:41,088
you have Ewing the demand is increasing

195
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,940
in a fast race you're you're still a

196
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,290
startup if I may say a small company how

197
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,910
does your company deal with the

198
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,899
fast-moving nature if you're such a

199
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,549
small company

200
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,559
what do you focus on

201
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:54,799
I mean sudden increase in demand and

202
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,319
also the regulatory obstacles will put

203
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,588
on workload onto your table how do you

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,370
deal with that I think it's important to

205
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:07,160
make a good product line for yourself to

206
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:11,600
see that you can give for every kind of

207
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:14,269
person something special but I think

208
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,430
there are so many products that people

209
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,589
are often overloaded they don't know

210
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,899
what they what they should buy because

211
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,209
they are not from this topic they are

212
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,759
not out of the cannabis industry or they

213
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:28,189
haven't been smoking before so they come

214
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,078
in and sometimes they are overloaded

215
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,529
with different oil concentrations I said

216
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:37,159
okay should it take to 5% to 10% to 20%

217
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:40,159
I don't know so I think it's important

218
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:44,929
to hold the product line small and good

219
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:47,689
and so you can can have something for

220
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:50,299
anybody and build a good Network it's

221
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,399
also important for the for the b2b and

222
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:56,049
so you're able to deliver nearly

223
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,429
everything what's your take on this I

224
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:01,278
would agree with my colleague on my

225
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:03,019
right about the consumers I think what

226
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,939
is unique in this business and we've

227
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,740
been in business for thirty years that

228
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,980
actually I have never met so well

229
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,990
educated consumers they study they study

230
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,310
the the stuff on the net

231
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,899
they're very educated and they're very

232
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:20,629
loyal so this will be my point that if

233
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:23,589
you deliver the right really what you

234
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:25,578
say consumers will stay with you okay

235
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:29,450
Chris how do you see it from your

236
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:31,039
perspective yes I believe we are dealing

237
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,528
with a more educated client than we were

238
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,480
dealing with five years ago or six years

239
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:40,039
ago and absolutely we're learning and

240
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,930
learning to help feed the need that

241
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,399
those educated and buyers have but I

242
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,338
think the bigger opportunity is those

243
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,839
that have no idea what CBD is I have no

244
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,149
idea what cannabis is never heard of an

245
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:55,220
endocannabinoid system and are just

246
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:57,169
looking to feel better to meet a need

247
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,250
that they have and what we're doing is

248
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:01,549
working on our messaging and our

249
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,929
packaging to just offer that you know I

250
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:03,469
want to sleep better I want to feel

251
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,000
better

252
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,949
I want to get rid of information I want

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,328
to get rid of pain and then create a

254
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:11,120
product that says that that we don't I

255
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:12,289
think one of the challenging things in

256
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,389
our industry is that there's a certain

257
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:16,849
segment of our clients that want to know

258
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,919
the percentage and the genealogy and the

259
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,589
seeds and where it was grown others just

260
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:24,559
want to know is it good is it going to

261
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,939
help me where can I get it and we have

262
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,568
to be able to speak to both those type

263
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:31,250
of clients so it already came through

264
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:33,828
and some of the answers and now we're

265
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,318
moving on to the regulatory question of

266
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:40,758
this panel kai you're gonna be up in a

267
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:42,679
sec but basically so we have hindrances

268
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,909
for example not being able to talk about

269
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:49,399
it health claim issues and so forth and

270
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:51,409
which registration is important in this

271
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,389
context what would you say kai what

272
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:58,789
what's the homework that has to be done

273
00:11:53,389 --> 00:12:00,769
when selling a CBD product first few the

274
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:04,149
most common product we have at the

275
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:07,639
moment is the the supplement so it's a

276
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:10,278
supplement to your normal diet and it's

277
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,438
labeled as a supplement then you have to

278
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:15,409
notify your product in the supplementary

279
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:18,938
register and you have to label it

280
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:22,958
correctly due to the you supplement

281
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:26,438
directives and you have to give notice

282
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,729
that it's out of reach of children and

283
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:32,179
you have to have you have to name the

284
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,550
the main ingredient and you have to do

285
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:38,479
that pretty correctly and then you can

286
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:40,250
sell it as a supplement the the other

287
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,720
way is so they are the problem is that

288
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,278
you can't make a health claim that's I

289
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,189
think this is the the biggest problem

290
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,899
for the industry because if you have a

291
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:49,490
nice brand in a nice shop and the

292
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,429
consumer comes in and asked what this

293
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,129
for I can't tell you what that doesn't

294
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:57,679
make sense you know so in the in the

295
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:00,289
future the companies have to work on on

296
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,219
that and the you legal framework offers

297
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:07,308
two options you can apply to get into

298
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,170
the EU health claims catalog or you can

299
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:12,469
register your product as a traditional

300
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:15,948
herbal medicine then you of course have

301
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,430
to prove the the effects or the health

302
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:18,379
claims

303
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:20,659
you you want to make you have to some

304
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:25,970
research some studies and database on

305
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:27,289
that too to be able to register as some

306
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,050
kind of this product yeah

307
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:33,289
so hearing that wouldn't it basically

308
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:36,679
make more sense to go the pharmaceutical

309
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:39,049
route so you are able to talk about it

310
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,778
to the consumer also thinking about the

311
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:44,059
consumers interest in transparency in

312
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:48,528
this context wouldn't that what's all

313
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:50,208
your opinions on that question I mean if

314
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:53,208
you make if you make a health claim and

315
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:56,989
even if if you if someone else makes a

316
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:58,939
health claim for you on your product UN

317
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,060
danger that you your product will be

318
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,730
deemed as a medicine according to the

319
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:06,979
medicine act like a presentation

320
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,879
medicine present at once that's nine

321
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:14,570
metal and yeah that's that's that's the

322
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,399
risk you you you and you if you have if

323
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,370
you want to become a real medicine like

324
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,549
according to the AMG the medicine law

325
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,740
then this is very complicated this costs

326
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:27,949
a lot of money's clinical studies trials

327
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,930
possible double-blind et cetera that's

328
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,660
over the top I think because it's just a

329
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:36,259
supplement it's just it's intended for

330
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:39,829
homeostasis for being balanced and not

331
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:41,179
for curing diseases so we have to

332
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,990
actually you have to work and find a

333
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:46,509
workaround in in that okay Chris yeah I

334
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,659
don't think it's as complicated as that

335
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:52,580
I think that it gets more complicated

336
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:54,259
because people want to make claims

337
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,730
because they want to tell you all the

338
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,669
amazing things that they've felt that

339
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,250
this plant and this product has done but

340
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:02,809
the reason CBD works is because it gives

341
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,539
the information to your body to help it

342
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:09,528
heal itself and if we just explain to

343
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:12,289
people that this aids in the relief of

344
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:14,629
temporary sleeplessness this supports

345
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:16,250
you being able to have less inflammation

346
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:18,350
in your body if you use the right

347
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,850
vocabulary in the right words as the

348
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,889
guidelines of the different regulatory

349
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,589
bodies bodies in each individual country

350
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:28,250
it's easy where it becomes hard is when

351
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,139
people say it cures this my dog now

352
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,629
walks

353
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,669
those type of things are you don't you

354
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,470
and that's the challenge and we're one

355
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,118
of the only major CBD companies there's

356
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,889
not received a warning letter from the

357
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:42,100
FDA in the United States because we

358
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,198
follow those guidelines 100% and it's

359
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,790
very important that we do that and as an

360
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,338
industry and as a community that we

361
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:50,948
support companies that do that and we

362
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:53,679
don't follow the easy route the

363
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:56,229
temporary route of a quick sale because

364
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:57,668
we want to say this one thing and if we

365
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,879
just learn the education and learn the

366
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:02,499
way to say it it's it's a lot simpler

367
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,409
woman do you have anything to add yeah

368
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:08,290
we we don't use claims as you know we

369
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:11,469
sell cosmetic products we have the plans

370
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:13,868
to upgrade to some medical device which

371
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,970
we need some studies but this is back to

372
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:18,879
the point you know we should consumers

373
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:22,059
are educated you know they do study so I

374
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,899
think that we should just I would say

375
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:27,818
guide and education you know was calling

376
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,129
admissions so this is the right way

377
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:32,798
we should not say we should not use hard

378
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:35,499
work words but we know how you know

379
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:37,568
Europe is very precise with you sexually

380
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:39,759
so let's get a bit more specific on that

381
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:41,649
one so best practice you selling it but

382
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,829
you're not allowed to talk about it how

383
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,999
do you do it Philip this is a very good

384
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:47,798
question

385
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:50,519
it's how I told you before the most

386
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:53,649
people come already informed to the shop

387
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,589
but for sure a lot of times the people

388
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,470
come in and tell you about their issues

389
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:01,839
and if it helps or not but you have to

390
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,369
say you can cannot give any answers for

391
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,980
this because you're not allowed you're

392
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:08,288
not a pharmacy you're not a doctor you

393
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,338
can try it for this this is what you can

394
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:15,638
say maybe some other consumers or

395
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:18,188
customers already have an experience

396
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:22,408
with the same topic and they talk to

397
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:25,209
each other this is also an a possibility

398
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:26,919
but do people understand it when you say

399
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,649
you're not allowed to to inform about

400
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,600
some health claims or anything they

401
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:35,168
understand it and they just try it and

402
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:37,089
when they try it they come back how do

403
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:39,399
these consumers educate themselves

404
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,259
outside of your shop there so they come

405
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:42,359
educated who how do they get the

406
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:46,259
information

407
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:48,000
do you have any ID on that I think you

408
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:50,670
can find a lot of in the Internet the

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,170
problem in the Internet is that there

410
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:56,519
are a lot of informations which are not

411
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:59,390
founded just opinions and then and this

412
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:03,629
is a problem I think so we need more

413
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,280
official website official organizations

414
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:09,030
where the people can inform by

415
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,819
themselves ok anybody anything to add so

416
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:14,009
let's address this specific topic novel

417
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:17,849
food in this context because it's been

418
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:20,460
in the media a lot in recent weeks how

419
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:23,789
do you guys live with the novel food

420
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,429
regulation at this point maybe it's the

421
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:28,740
same with the FDA approval that stands

422
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:31,530
in the room how do you go about this

423
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,779
Chris maybe from the FDA perspective

424
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:35,250
please sure so the FDA in the United

425
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,829
States and the novel foods here in

426
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,589
Europe is different regulatory boards

427
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:41,909
run those and we're working closely with

428
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:44,369
each one of those to make sure that we

429
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,808
already meet all of the guidelines for

430
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:47,969
those in our manufacturing and

431
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:49,740
distribution and testing processes and

432
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,259
we're working with them to make sure

433
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,140
that when available we'll be ready to

434
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:56,869
get those certifications but until that

435
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,570
point nobody said we can't move forward

436
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:02,039
so we're acting business as usual and as

437
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:03,659
they ask for more information about our

438
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,129
products more information about the

439
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,509
industry we're providing those we're

440
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,590
working with lobby groups we're working

441
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:11,700
with industrial and industry groups in

442
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:14,220
42 different countries to be able to do

443
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,350
so Kai from a legal perspective what

444
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,240
would you recommend companies in regard

445
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:20,339
to novel food how would you what would

446
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,099
you say to them if they want to set up a

447
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:26,220
business now on CBD yeah we have seen a

448
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,798
lot of new developments in the last

449
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,039
month regarding novel food

450
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:35,279
it started in Austria as Ministry of

451
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:40,558
Health in Austria advised the governor's

452
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:42,298
to enforce the novel food regulation and

453
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,839
then there must have been some

454
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:48,058
discussions on bilateral political in

455
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,699
Brussels and they decided in January to

456
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:53,730
change the noble food catalog before

457
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,500
that it was if the percentage of CBD is

458
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,630
higher than in the original plant

459
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,619
so it's this left room for

460
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:04,919
interpretation and nowadays it is all

461
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:05,699
extracts from from from or canopy no

462
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,690
it's ex-fix

463
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,730
extracts are novel food so what is what

464
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,120
is an extract yeah what's the definition

465
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,849
what's the interpretation of an extract

466
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:22,168
and then you can yeah you need to

467
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:24,209
solvent if you if your extract some some

468
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:27,000
solvent method or some some solvent

469
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,850
stuff and then you start the extraction

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,298
process it's still as I learned it's

471
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:37,668
still how planned then but you change

472
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:42,658
the percentages so you enrich and you

473
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:44,820
you you make you you make it more from

474
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:47,010
from the stuff you want and you you get

475
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,668
the stuff out you download and at this

476
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:52,079
point you are in the nobler food

477
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,179
directive the normal food directive is

478
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:59,220
applicable there to your to your product

479
00:20:54,179 --> 00:21:02,850
so and we see that in the bvl next door

480
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:06,419
is the Food Authority of Germany it's

481
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:09,808
they published in a new entry on their

482
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:13,140
web page where they explicitly say if

483
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:16,259
you're in which your product with CBD

484
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,030
it's it's noble food so yeah I don't

485
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,379
know what's going to happen the next six

486
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:23,609
nine month we saw the example in Austria

487
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,159
the the Ministry of Health and

488
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:30,058
instructing the governor's to enforce

489
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,580
the novel food directive you can read it

490
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:35,190
in on the Food Safety Authority in

491
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:38,730
Ireland on that webpage if we get in our

492
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,460
cases of extracts of products you think

493
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:45,150
X 2 it's there we'll go after them

494
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:47,940
but they also say and this is yeah the

495
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,610
bottom line I guess right now which also

496
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:54,659
I have published in his paper in their

497
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:56,519
paper if you find a method which which

498
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:00,590
allows you that you have the full plant

499
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:03,029
and you don't you down in which

500
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:05,788
something like you like to count press

501
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:08,038
like a traditional manufacturing Prak

502
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:09,250
practice you on the safe side and you

503
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:10,900
can use that product

504
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,730
but what I've learned also is that

505
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:18,519
companies don't like that because the

506
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:21,130
oil which uses extracts is easier to use

507
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,529
is consumer friendly or people like it

508
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:26,080
more to use it's it's not as dark and a

509
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:28,359
sticky and it just looks nicer and it's

510
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,480
not as complicated to use a code press

511
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:33,750
method so yeah but the future will I

512
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,730
think we will have some some some

513
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,470
developments in the next near future on

514
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,890
how the authorities react on that

515
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,200
problem so maybe Philip and Roman a

516
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,049
question for you next so we have these

517
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,120
regulatory obstacles what do you do when

518
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:51,879
you get confronted with a new situation

519
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:55,418
do you have workarounds for this what

520
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,059
would you recommend yes we have grants

521
00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:02,080
in the first step Ostia it happened at

522
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:05,048
first there we had to change quickly the

523
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:09,329
declaration just as a flavor product

524
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:11,829
again how it was before some years ago

525
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:14,678
but this is just just a short

526
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:19,720
perspective I think you have to change

527
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:23,110
the process after after producing for a

528
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:27,159
longer timeframe but also we have a an

529
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:29,529
exciting I to to the new regulation in

530
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:32,289
this market because I think how Young

531
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:36,190
said it's about six nine and six to nine

532
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:39,788
months and we will know more and till

533
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,980
this time we have to have workarounds

534
00:23:39,788 --> 00:23:44,710
how I said and there are different ways

535
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:48,460
to do it different declaration different

536
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,190
declaration cold-pressed stuff and these

537
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,720
things yeah this is the same like in the

538
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,730
whole market you have to stay very

539
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,980
flexible at the moment because there's

540
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:01,839
no good regulation this null food

541
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,150
situation actually has been the same

542
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,399
almost for year and a half it's about

543
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,130
the execution of the null food how you

544
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,860
know so we were aware of this a year ago

545
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,780
so simply we do not claim on the back we

546
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:18,428
are food supplement because then your

547
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:20,529
null food so there ways how to white you

548
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:22,570
know you can market some products as a

549
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:25,359
topical uses or cosmetics and you know

550
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,950
you have sometimes vitamin C which you

551
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,469
put on the skin or you put belong the

552
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,048
tank you know is very this is how we do

553
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,079
it and in some cases you know we have

554
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:38,139
purely cosmetic products creams which

555
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:41,379
are in C P and P portal so we know it's

556
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,750
it's a cosmetic product so it's not only

557
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,470
you know you can we have many products

558
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:51,089
we do not have any food supplement has

559
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,429
anybody applied for the novel food

560
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:56,109
regulation yet know a lot but we know

561
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,970
they were of one of the first companies

562
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:00,069
more than a year ago was one Czech

563
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:03,130
company we know this was seems from

564
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:06,908
March last year so he's a quite some

565
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:08,669
time okay I want Stan it's from 2016 and

566
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:11,440
they even haven't passed the first stage

567
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:15,580
they which means they couldn't provide

568
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,230
the toxic toxicological and survey that

569
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:18,538
the product isn't harmful to the

570
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,038
consumer

571
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:23,288
so we heard from Chris Chris is in

572
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,509
dialogue with the FDA in dialogue with

573
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:27,849
the regulatory bodies now from a

574
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:29,919
European perspective we all know the

575
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:33,788
European industrial hemp association was

576
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,950
at the uau Commission recently people

577
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:37,058
are trying to find a dialogue if you

578
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:43,058
look at the media though it sometimes

579
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:46,839
seems as in them how should the industry

580
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:48,970
take action against these obstacles in

581
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:52,288
your opinion how should the industry

582
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:57,490
organize themselves to make the product

583
00:25:52,288 --> 00:26:00,759
accessible to a wider consumer range

584
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,950
sorry I know about the European

585
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,319
industrial hemp Association you know

586
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,019
they do efforts lobbying that you know

587
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:10,808
this would pass and that cannabinoids

588
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:13,538
would not be a novel food art in certain

589
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:15,490
milligrams per day we fully support this

590
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:19,298
and I think they've been quite

591
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:21,069
successful but I'm not a regulatory

592
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:23,859
person this will be the only comment

593
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:26,138
from this side hi what's your opinion

594
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:30,359
how should one organize oneself I

595
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:34,619
suggest some decent litigation on this

596
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:37,079
so that you you can you can continue to

597
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:40,369
distribute your products the authorities

598
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:43,288
would have to issue a distribution ban

599
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:44,729
official distribution ban and you can

600
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:50,460
take legal remedies against this

601
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:54,390
distribution ban and they can only issue

602
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,710
an immediate enforcement so that you

603
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,259
really have to stop to sell these

604
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:02,850
products just in case of of a danger of

605
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:05,308
the consumer and as we now see BDS has a

606
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:08,579
good safety profile the World Health

607
00:27:05,308 --> 00:27:12,509
Organization published the CBD report

608
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:15,178
last June and they found out that there

609
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:18,658
are no side effects they gave people

610
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:21,028
over 3-month 300 milligram to fawn and

611
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,850
milligram per day and no side effects

612
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:25,888
shout shout up so this can't be an

613
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:28,949
argument so you can distribute your

614
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:31,079
products until the end of the pivotal to

615
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:35,069
the final legal decision and that may be

616
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:38,609
can take three four or five years so I

617
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:41,849
think this will be this will be sorted

618
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:45,719
out about litigation if the if the

619
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:47,879
company's doesn't down the nerve another

620
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,269
food directive doesn't stop the

621
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,778
companies then it has to go to court if

622
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:56,250
you look to the UK still Europe UK

623
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:58,558
cannabis trade association is

624
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,630
instructing a law firm to go and take

625
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,178
action Chris do you think that's the

626
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,250
right approach to instruct a law firm to

627
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:08,970
take action or do you think it should be

628
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:14,038
more I don't know a nice dialogue on

629
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:15,720
that area well I know for us we work

630
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,419
with the European help Association we

631
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,278
work with the cannabis associations we

632
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,769
work with the USF authority we work with

633
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:24,690
just about any trade association out

634
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:28,829
there because we know that there's not

635
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:30,630
enough being done right so whether it's

636
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:33,599
legal action whether it's lobbying

637
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:36,809
whether it's going to your different

638
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,819
political representative and knocking on

639
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:41,158
their door I think more of that has to

640
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:43,138
happen I think we all have to internally

641
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,740
regulate ourselves and we have to

642
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,029
internally

643
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,740
cooperate and help make sure that the

644
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:51,779
people that play well together do well

645
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,319
and the people that are trying to force

646
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:57,569
their own agenda don't that's great now

647
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,178
in the description of the panel there

648
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:03,720
was also the competition from Big Pharma

649
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:06,540
was in there is do you have competition

650
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,970
by Big Pharma and how does it reflect on

651
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:12,480
your daily business let's start with

652
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,069
Phillip maybe here at the moment I can

653
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,679
not say that we have a competition with

654
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:19,500
the Big Pharma because the reason why

655
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,840
people buy these products is to go away

656
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:27,329
from the Big Pharma to go back more to

657
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:29,399
nature and to natural producers so when

658
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:31,889
we produce it in in Austria we have our

659
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,990
hemp fields and it's all organic grown

660
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:37,110
and the people know it and it's

661
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:40,289
transparent I think they'd like to get

662
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:43,379
more suction product than final medicine

663
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:47,279
from from the pharmacy but it's up to

664
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,940
the type of customer also Roman do you

665
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,799
have big farmers a threat we don't we

666
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,420
don't see them as a threat I think this

667
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,109
could be opportunity because they will

668
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:00,269
focus on some other aspects where we we

669
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:02,729
cannot compete and we don't want to

670
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:04,829
compete with them we have our experience

671
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,039
where we already cooperate with fight or

672
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:09,558
Pharma producer fairly big one so we can

673
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:13,549
work together

674
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:16,349
Chris how is it from a u.s. perspective

675
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:17,730
I think globally that any pharmaceutical

676
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:20,519
company that wants to come into the

677
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,829
market is only going to help educate

678
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,369
help normalize and help get more people

679
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:26,279
using it

680
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:28,409
I'm currently epidemics is a $32,000 a

681
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,119
year pharmaceutical I don't feel any

682
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,120
competition from somebody that's going

683
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,529
to sell at that high level and be a you

684
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,869
know basically a pharmaceutical drug

685
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:38,730
like to his point people are looking for

686
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:40,379
natural alternatives to give their body

687
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,759
the information to heal itself they're

688
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,590
not looking for another opioid right no

689
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:50,190
to take a step back from a wave maybe

690
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:54,000
from the regulatory topics so the panel

691
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,650
is called mainstreaming of CBD now it

692
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,210
was just a very obvious question but

693
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,419
still what is

694
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:03,990
your outlook on this how will the market

695
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:08,240
develop will CBD become a mainstream

696
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:08,240
developer but product in your eyes

697
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:14,069
absolutely it has to it's one of the

698
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,100
most innovative most effective things

699
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:19,079
that's come out in history right it's

700
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:20,428
been around forever and we're just now

701
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,048
starting to realize the effects of it

702
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:23,850
thank you you know to those that

703
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,500
discovered the endocannabinoids system

704
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,058
and you know all the people that have

705
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,278
been pushing the cannabis agenda for

706
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:30,750
decades and we're all standing on their

707
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,190
shoulders and I appreciate all the work

708
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,109
and fighting that they've done to show

709
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,500
the medical benefits of the cannabis

710
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:39,569
plant and now it's only getting to the

711
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,730
point where it's normalizing where

712
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:43,980
people just it makes no sense that this

713
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,259
isn't the same as craft beer because

714
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,710
right now you know just imagine if craft

715
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:52,408
beer came out as a trend at the same

716
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,000
time prohibition ended right that's

717
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:56,909
exactly what this is right

718
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,099
our new craft beer is coming out exactly

719
00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:00,480
when Prohibition ended and it's going to

720
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,469
be normal and everybody's gonna take it

721
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,089
and you're gonna grow it in your own

722
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,409
backyard you're gonna make it and you're

723
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:06,028
gonna buy it at your own grocery store

724
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:07,649
and you're gonna buy it from your doctor

725
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:09,298
and you're gonna have all sorts of

726
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:10,709
different flavors and find ways to get

727
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:11,548
it and it's just gonna be completely

728
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,710
normal

729
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:17,398
how will the intake be Chris will be

730
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,140
sipping or smoking CBD whichever way you

731
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,629
want

732
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,190
for me I love the topical Zinner

733
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,649
liposomal product because it just works

734
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,778
so fast because we have Martha Stewart

735
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:30,058
apparently doing some developments

736
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:32,788
jellybean CBD is in the air all these

737
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:34,470
news flash has been about I appreciate I

738
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:37,319
appreciate again people looking for

739
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,390
innovative ways to take CBD and and I'm

740
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,490
sure my my pen a fellow panelists have

741
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,850
some input on this and you know I love

742
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:46,769
that Martha Stewart is bringing this

743
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:50,219
more normal right

744
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:51,418
but we all know that a jelly beans not a

745
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,058
great way to take something that's going

746
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,288
to help your body right it's it's a fun

747
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:57,168
recreational way to take some other

748
00:32:55,288 --> 00:33:01,230
things but CBD is probably not the best

749
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:03,538
in my opinion I agree with this we

750
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,730
directly see it with our customers

751
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:08,369
because it's not just a trend I think

752
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,769
because they come one time to try it but

753
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:11,308
they come again and they say it from

754
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,710
10.com

755
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:16,918
again and so I think it will normalize

756
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:20,759
how I say in Europe not so much people

757
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,409
know about CBD now but this city market

758
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,679
is running and it's growing very fast

759
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:27,840
and I think it will normalize we just

760
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,850
will see how the how the regulation will

761
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:34,769
happen roman that cannabis was called 1

762
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:36,748
million plant back in the history

763
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:38,819
because you know we started to make

764
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:41,669
robes for the sailing the end of food

765
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:43,168
and each part of the plant was used CBD

766
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:46,019
just on top of this I think is a

767
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:48,590
revolutionary I think this process

768
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,720
cannot be stopped I think that

769
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:53,908
regulating would help us as well

770
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,970
organize producer because what we found

771
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:59,340
out a lot of I would say producers which

772
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:02,009
are now not consistent which are not

773
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:04,470
fair to the consumers but I think sky's

774
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:08,940
the limit and we just go should work

775
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:11,039
together and focus in the future ok

776
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,648
wanna add anything how do you think the

777
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:16,608
market will develop from a legal point

778
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:18,568
of view maybe as well yeah the the the

779
00:34:16,608 --> 00:34:21,318
interesting question will be how the

780
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:25,230
authorities will deal with another food

781
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:29,219
directive in the next 6 to 12 month we

782
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:31,019
haven't seen any I've no real cases on

783
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,289
on distribution bans or anything like

784
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:36,358
that

785
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:39,588
I had to CBD sample imports which were

786
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:44,549
stopped at the customs it in car school

787
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:47,909
one with with the the reasoning that CBD

788
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:53,460
is medicine and the import license

789
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:56,250
wasn't there so then they examined the

790
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,909
product and realized oh it's only it's

791
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,920
only a 30 30 milligram daily intake so

792
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:04,559
it's not the relevant for a

793
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,079
pharmacological effect and they stopped

794
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,900
the proceeding and the other sample they

795
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,269
had health claims so they could say ah

796
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:17,309
it's a medicine it's a presentation

797
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:20,130
medicine and we we keep we keep it we so

798
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:23,509
that's the only two cases I had but it

799
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:25,220
would be an interesting would be into

800
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,930
you have to see what what's going on the

801
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:30,500
next 12 month this will be an

802
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:33,949
interesting period I'm not quite sure

803
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:37,690
where we are on time you are very close

804
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:37,689
we have time for a couple of moments

805
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:49,250
let's hear for the panel thank you for

806
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:51,769
your attention for maybe two questions

807
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:55,519
one or two questions one or two anybody

808
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:58,280
have a question brief question no no all

809
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,679
right I have a question what what is it

810
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,560
gonna be full of CBD like you could put

811
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,480
CBD in a cream and a soap it up can we

812
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:09,009
have CBD infused strawberries or

813
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,480
chickens or beef jerky or coffee like

814
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,890
what's the limit is it gonna be in

815
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,460
everything we're just gonna put it in

816
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:18,289
the water what are we gonna do yeah I

817
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,670
hope that you folk that we continue to

818
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:21,590
focus on the high quality delivery

819
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,180
systems so that it's bioavailable and

820
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,740
people actually get the effects of it

821
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:27,230
and it just doesn't pass through our

822
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:29,118
body I think it's very important that we

823
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,429
continue to focus on full-spectrum oils

824
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,579
and really look at the science of bio

825
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:38,929
accessibility and bioavailability so

826
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:42,349
that will direct what we put it in I

827
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:44,629
have a comment to Kai I would never ever

828
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:46,339
expect that you will be able to register

829
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,640
traditional her parameters in the

830
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,170
product with cannabis this is impossible

831
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,608
because you need a 30 years of tradition

832
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,280
and you will never prove it I was

833
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:58,940
involved in over 100 applications of

834
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:05,359
registrations and this is not the case

835
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:07,340
this is not possible that's why there's

836
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:12,380
an exemption in these paragraphs but you

837
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:15,440
don't need 30 years and not necessarily

838
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,940
you need 30 years at least you need 15

839
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,619
into you and even this 15 need to be

840
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:26,300
connected to an indication and an

841
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:29,059
illness and post it's not there I don't

842
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,410
think you can say that I don't think you

843
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:32,269
can say that there that I don't think

844
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:36,190
you can say CBD is not connected to an

845
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:36,190
indication for more than 10 or 15 years

846
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:55,519
thank you so um we actually I'm

847
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:58,699
wondering I feel that CBD is super

848
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:01,400
popular in a certain group Gweneth

849
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:04,189
Paltrow lifestyle world because I keep

850
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,579
reading only in that context about CBD

851
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,990
so why do you guys think that is why do

852
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,819
you think it's popular with the planet

853
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:13,849
Skaro

854
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:16,309
personally best well she told me no no I

855
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:18,639
mean so to be more precise I feel it's

856
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:23,869
very popular in this world around

857
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:28,940
lifestyle yoga consciousness fashion so

858
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:30,769
kale yeah thank you for me what I've

859
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,840
what I've found is that people are

860
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:34,880
looking for alternatives and that group

861
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,380
that market share is looking for are

862
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,030
alternatives they don't want to buy

863
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,430
pharmaceuticals anymore they want to

864
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,430
biohack they want to neuro hack they

865
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:44,329
want to improve their lives they want to

866
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:46,099
invest in their health not their

867
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:47,239
sickness so that's why they're making

868
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:48,889
these decisions and that's why they're

869
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:51,979
moving forward and that's why things

870
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:54,170
like Gwyneth Paltrow and I think just

871
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,409
recently just in timber Justin Bieber's

872
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,250
wife was talking about it and it's all

873
00:38:57,409 --> 00:39:00,319
over the place

874
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,820
right and yeah it's not what I don't

875
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,800
think one of the Kardashians have talked

876
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,820
about it yet but still its overall

877
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,140
overall CBD is is moving into the health

878
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,510
and wellness space which is much bigger

879
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:15,409
and much more impactful than dealing

880
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,690
with indications oh yeah and I think the

881
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:20,750
trend is basically going back to the

882
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,539
nature stuff and I just think that this

883
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:26,630
kind of people when I can say it like to

884
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:29,300
support support this trend and this is

885
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,670
why it happens is there a way to ensure

886
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,930
that you're getting quality CBD I mean

887
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,809
because now you look everywhere you see

888
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:37,730
CD this CBD that is it hemp derive is it

889
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:38,710
made enough at like how do you know that

890
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,329
you're getting

891
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,639
bioavailable or good stuff or quality

892
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:44,989
you just see they just it's almost like

893
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:46,429
they just throw three letters on a

894
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:48,529
package and expect you to believe it

895
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:49,079
like how can people figure out what's

896
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,970
good you

897
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,429
exactly right that's that is happening I

898
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:55,139
haven't seen any of that in this room or

899
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:58,109
this community or no one here will do

900
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:59,670
that but absolutely there are people

901
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:02,610
that are using CBD as a marketing term

902
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:05,700
like they did acai berries way back in

903
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,620
the day and CBD is much more than a

904
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:09,480
movement or a fad like that and it's

905
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,130
more like the new aloe vera and it's

906
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,090
going to be in a lot of things and it's

907
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,230
going to be there and you would

908
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,300
definitely want to know the quality

909
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:18,750
where it came from most of the company's

910
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,450
up here all of them provide their

911
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,130
certificates of analysis online so that

912
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:25,379
you can see the high quality that's

913
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,849
available there and additionally you can

914
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,380
read about it and see who's

915
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:30,089
participating in these different

916
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,650
organizations to move it forward that

917
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,019
are participating with groups like this

918
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,670
and where's all of this being grown like

919
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:40,199
is it all hemp derived is it all being

920
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:42,750
grown somewhere or yeah I mean you don't

921
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:44,879
have to tell me no I just this is what

922
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,710
we do as a company you know we as I

923
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,260
mentioned the beginning we control from

924
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,880
the field seats to the final product we

925
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,490
are for full transparency

926
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,789
you know certificate of analysis MSDS

927
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:59,309
whatever you call it and this is this

928
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:02,009
how it works on the long term because

929
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:05,159
you can find the products with the CBD

930
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:08,220
tag on but if once you analyze you will

931
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,289
find hardly a trace of CBD these things

932
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:12,329
are happening

933
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:14,070
we have farms throughout Europe and in

934
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:15,480
the United States we grow in both places

935
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,710
and we're growing him that was my next

936
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,380
question do you think that there's gonna

937
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:22,730
be like a huge global expansion of CBD

938
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:25,170
hemp and maybe like Portugal or

939
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:28,170
Macedonia or some of these not just

940
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,639
Canada oh my god I think every third

941
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,309
question I got here is I'm growing hemp

942
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,929
where do you want to buy it so

943
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:35,849
absolutely people are growing it all

944
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:37,649
over the place I think the challenge is

945
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,880
because hemp is such an amazing planet

946
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,820
it takes all the amazing things out of

947
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,990
the ground that it does really good

948
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,100
things for you but also if you don't

949
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:45,179
grow in the right place it takes all the

950
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,980
crap out of the ground it brings it

951
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:48,599
right into you so you have to really be

952
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,670
careful of where that source is coming

953
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,829
from there where you're getting and and

954
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,680
back to this sorry no hem now is being

955
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:58,829
used in everywhere we build houses it's

956
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:01,230
reducing automotive industry I don't

957
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:02,288
there was a study what Hamm does for

958
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,409
environment you know

959
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:08,890
fifteen tons of carbon monoxide per year

960
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:10,808
is cleaned by one hectare of hemp you

961
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:13,868
know I mean these are this is this is

962
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:15,910
public data so we should support hand on

963
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:17,949
all aspects not only because of the CBD

964
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:21,668
that's a good point we have time for one

965
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:25,028
more question and then we're below hello

966
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:27,219
everybody so my question is around when

967
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:29,650
we're talking about CBD we're really

968
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:33,309
talking about the the flower that does

969
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:35,979
not have the THC in it a lot of times

970
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:38,469
we're not specifically only focused on

971
00:42:35,978 --> 00:42:40,328
on the CBD there's also a lot of other

972
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:42,699
cannabinoids that are not mentioned that

973
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:44,469
are included in those in those in these

974
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:46,809
full-spectrum extracts underlying about

975
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:48,759
yeah so with cannabis there's there's

976
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:50,349
very specific effects that you'll find

977
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:52,449
with various strains my question is

978
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:56,969
really around the idea of strain hunting

979
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:59,709
in the CBD market and what are the I

980
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:03,929
just anecdotes on that topic seem like a

981
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:07,118
really interesting area of discussion I

982
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:09,309
just can say that Europe is much

983
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,999
different than the US because you have

984
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:14,739
control strains and the seeds and I

985
00:43:12,998 --> 00:43:17,078
think Europe is not competitive here

986
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:20,318
with Switzerland and US and I think this

987
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:25,749
could be potentially a problem in the

988
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:27,489
future but yes this is this is the thing

989
00:43:25,748 --> 00:43:30,538
that we have a catalogue of strains

990
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:33,668
which we can we are allowed to use and

991
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:36,939
in some countries you have to chance to

992
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:38,708
select out of this seeds but in a and

993
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:40,928
now that countries not so in Germany for

994
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:43,618
sure not your chests allowed to bring

995
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:45,999
out the seeds and harvest what you got

996
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:47,199
all right thank you all very much let's

997
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,369
hear it for our panel I'm sorry I don't

998
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,139
have time

999
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:53,630
but I'm sure you could talk to them in

1000
00:43:51,139 --> 00:43:56,179

1001
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:59,300
