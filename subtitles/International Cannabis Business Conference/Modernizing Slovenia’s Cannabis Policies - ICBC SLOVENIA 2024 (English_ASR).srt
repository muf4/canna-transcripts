1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,318
here to discuss modernizing

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:09,119
slovenia's uh new cannabis policies the

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:10,839
chief compliance officer of the Talman

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,689
group and one of my favorite people in

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:21,850
this country let's hear it for gbar

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:21,850
[Applause]

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:31,358
frises

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,239
okay so hello uh how does it work okay

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,000
yeah so I thought we start with a

10
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,919
beautiful picture of our Lake bled

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,119
because today you're sadly robbed of

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,559
this beautiful view because of the

13
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,238
weather so I would invite everybody to

14
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,479
come back once it's really nice and

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,640
you'll be able to enjoy it like

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:52,358
that uh so the the issue of cannabis has

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,320
long been debated in our country but now

18
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,039
finally with new legislation on the

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,159
horizon we are finally taking concrete

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,719
steps to make medical cannabis more

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,359
accessible safer and regulated for those

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,799
who need it um as we heard this morning

23
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,920
from our secretary of state we stand at

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,159
a pivotal moment in our history the main

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,960
objectives for our new legislations are

26
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,240
clear so to to uh to make access for

27
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:23,959
patients to protect the youth and to

28
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:26,759
regulate for those in need so at

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,919
present uh recreational cannabis in

30
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,239
Slovenia is illegal and that also goes

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,439
for hemp um that's something that a lot

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,319
of people don't know but if you don't

33
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,559
have a license from our Ministry of

34
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,478
Agriculture growing hemp is illegal and

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,280
is a criminal offense uh so regardless

36
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,799
of the level of

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,680
THC uh with medical cannabis the

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
situation is a bit different because

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,360
medical cannabis is although it's legal

40
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,478
by law it doesn't really work in

41
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:00,599
practice uh patients cannot access it

42
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,438
and basically due to uh restrictions in

43
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,759
practice that stem down to the position

44
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,679
of our agency for medicinal products and

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
their interpretation of the decree on

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,800
elicity drugs their position is as we

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,759
heard today that cannabis can only be

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,560
prescribed accordance with guidelines

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,479
the issue we have in Slovenia is that we

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,800
don't have those guidelines except for

51
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,439
terminally ill patients and I know that

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,239
professor noow and his colleagues are

53
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,079
now preparing guidelines for Pediatric

54
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,159
patients uh and this is the problem or

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,560
this is the barrier why doctors cannot

56
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:37,359
prescribe cannabis for other medical

57
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,158
conditions um meanwhile in other

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,239
countries like UK Switzerland Canada and

59
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:46,560
so on they have specific guidelines for

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,319
a white for a big variety of U

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,560
conditions as uh nette syndrome

62
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,280
fibromyalgia insomnia and so on and so

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,158
on and in Germany which we heard is the

64
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,280
biggest Medical Market in EU the things

65
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:01,199
are even more pragmatic they don't have

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
specific guidelines at all but their

67
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,479
Ministry of Health just posted a link to

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,519
the Canadian guidelines or the website

69
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,919
and placing the trust in their medical

70
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,360
community that they can take the right

71
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,318
decision based on the knowledge that

72
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
they have and I think this is something

73
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,238
that we could also

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,200
follow uh and this brings us to the

75
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,599
historic moment that we already heard

76
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:28,119
something about today in Slovenia on the

77
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:31,318
9th of June 2024 we held two referendums

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,599
on cannabis uh um as you can see more

79
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,878
than 700,000 participants went to this

80
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:38,399
vote this might not seem a lot to some

81
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,280
of you but you have to consider that we

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,360
have 2 million inhabitants in Slovenia

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,080
so that was a huge number and I would

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,159
like to show you the results of those

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,079
votes this is for recreational

86
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,878
cannabis and as you can

87
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,200
see

88
00:03:53,878 --> 00:04:01,719
51.5% 57% of every voters uh everyone

89
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,560
who voted was for recreational Cannabis

90
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,598
uh on the map you can see the voting

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,560
districts that were for and against the

92
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,639
dark Blues are the ones that were

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,598
against and the Light blues are where

94
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,478
the majority was for and now I would

95
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,918
like to show you the more interesting

96
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,519
one this is the map for medical cannabis

97
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,319
and as you can see every voting district

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,120
in Slovenia was in favor in fact more

99
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,199
than 60% in every voting district and

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,360
this is something that is unprecedented

101
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
in Slovenia

102
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,240
or let me say it's unprecedented since

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,759
since the vote in 1990 when we voted on

104
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,720
our independence we have never been so

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,479
United on a question and I'm really glad

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,759
about it so I think that with this

107
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,120
mandate Slovenia should change its

108
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,000
legislation and I think we should follow

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,280
the German model what this means is

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,120
first taking cannabis off the narcotics

111
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,918
list this is important because it's

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,840
going to isn't the B isas it the burden

113
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,879
on our Judicial System there's not going

114
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,959
to be any more criminal procedures for

115
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,279
for small possession and it's going to

116
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,519
make prescribing cannabis much easier

117
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,959
medical cannabis because the doctors

118
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,359
will no longer be prescribing a narcotic

119
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,279
so it's not going to be any

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,720
prescriptions in in two forms and so on

121
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,799
it's going to make it easier for them uh

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,680
so and we should also Empower our

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,478
doctors by allowing them to apply their

124
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,840
expertise and to provide patients with

125
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,359
the care they need we shouldn't we

126
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,198
shouldn't borrow them with guidelines

127
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,919
but rather relate on their knowledge

128
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,520
that they have uh but at the same time

129
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,079
we should remain a strong commitment to

130
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,839
protecting our youth and dismantling the

131
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,879
black market that sadly still exists in

132
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,439
Slovenia uh and I think that this this

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,719
new chapter in slovenia's canab cannabis

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,199
policy is not or should not should not

135
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,880
just be about legislation it's about

136
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,560
modernizing our approach to Medicine

137
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,000
patient care and Public Health it's

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
about placing trust in our medical

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
community and ensuring that those who

140
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,160
need cannabis can actually get

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
it it should also be taking about taking

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,919
control of a industry or sector that

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,240
sadly in the absence um of good

144
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,758
regulation threatens the well-being of

145
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,199
our youth and of our public

146
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:29,879
health so I really hope that as we move

147
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,360
forward now I hope we can embrace is

148
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,038
change as a nation United just as we did

149
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,598
in 1990 when we were voting on our

150
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,159
independence I am sure that we can

151
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,519
create a future where cannabis policies

152
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,639
Serve the People where patients receive

153
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,399
the care they need and where our laws

154
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,038
reflect both the modern Medical Science

155
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,769
and the will of the selenian people so

156
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:58,439
thank you

157
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:58,439
[Applause]

158
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,280

German models in every kind

162
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:26,240

better um Mr uh

169
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:54,199
uh also

170
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:58,120
hi I asked him before what is the best

171
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,759
model he thinks because he has a lot of

172
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,079
experiences

173
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:09,319
um he says it's the Canadian model so

174
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:12,800
I'm asking you is this choosing of this

175
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:16,598
journal model just final or it's just's

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:21,840
say question thinking about

177
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:24,639
this choose the best model maybe how you

178
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,719
how this decision will be take yeah

179
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,680
thank my timing is

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,320
perfect um so

181
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,839
um I think we should follow the German

182
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,159
model not copy it so take the things

183
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,599
that are good and also as we heard today

184
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,639
and a lot of other occasions not take

185
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,040
the things that are not so good or try

186
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,679
to make them

187
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:51,079
better yes the Canadian model would be

188
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:54,599
one possibility to go but we have to

189
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,200
realize that Canada is not an EU country

190
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,839
so they're not bound by the EU

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,040
regulation which is stricter to the uh

192
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,480
conventions of of the United Nations so

193
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,078
following the Canadian model for

194
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,839
Slovenia would be quite problematic uh

195
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,199
so that's why we're trying to follow the

196
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,120
German model and also to be H to be

197
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,920
honest it's it's a pragmatic thing to do

198
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,519
because Slovenia we're as as you heard

199
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,159
we have 2 million inhabitants so we are

200
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,959
small country and I don't think we

201
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,679
should be the one poking the EU

202
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,799
commission with something more than

203
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:30,679
Germany did from a strictly political

204
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,120
point of view uh because if as you

205
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,439
probably know Germany was thinking about

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,519
getting

207
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,720
this x uh selling of cannabis in this

208
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,879
specialized story and so on and they got

209
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,800
a more or less clear re answer don't do

210
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,519
it that's why they changed their

211
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:51,919
legislation I mean the draft for the new

212
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,799
legislation and if they got a if the EU

213
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,360
commission said no to Germany I'm pretty

214
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,439
sure they're not going to say yes to

215
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Slovenia it's it's a fact so that's why

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,200
think we will we should follow the

217
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
German model but as I said not copy it

218
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,160
so

219
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,200
question

220
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:14,719
so do our model would choose the

221
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,440
European Union or we choose Slovenian

222
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,959
government it's it's good it's good

223
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,640
everybody hear me no hear you can you

224
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,159
hear me the translators need to hear you

225
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,838
they're oh

226
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:30,199
sorry um so it's the European Union

227
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:34,160
deciding what's the best model or

228
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,920
are we deciding uh we will we decide

229
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:41,000
what's the best model for us cuz if you

230
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:44,719
ask uh let's say Hungary they will say

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
uh European Union we will

232
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:53,320
decide as uh for ourself so asking what

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,240
we will do yeah I mean as I said it's

234
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,278
it's it's a nice idea

235
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,720
but I

236
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:04,278
think because because of the current

237
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,560
position of many like the the the United

238
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:08,600
Nations and everything as I said I think

239
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,958
we shouldn't poke too much right now

240
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,240
especially as a smaller country there

241
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:15,000
will be chance later on to amend the

242
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,600
legislation it's you can always do that

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,519
but I think from a political perspective

244
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,839
it's wise to follow or do what the

245
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,159
Germany did and not go further that's

246
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:30,959
just my position we have a question yeah

247
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:33,039
hi uh since we can all agree that all of

248
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,479
the national policies sort of come to a

249
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,078
stop when you hit the European policies

250
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,959
how plausible do you think it would be

251
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,838
to get 1 million signatures to get a All

252
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,759
European referendum on the

253
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:51,200
subject you think you think to make the

254
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:54,838
an euwi referendum on this question or

255
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:59,920
yeah to be honest I have no idea I how

256
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,920
much would it cost though yeah and it's

257
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,078
I think it would probably need to

258
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,599
be proposed by the EU commission to do

259
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,319
something like that to be honest I don't

260
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
know I never heard of a

261
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,879
euwi

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,480
uh wait we have some questions over here

263
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,679
you ask questions you ask a lot of

264
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,240
questions so um but yeah I mean it would

265
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,278
be a nice idea to do it it would be

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,198
interesting to see what's the position

267
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:27,919
of every country so

268
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:31,278
yeah uh my name is varia holet I'm

269
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:34,120
attorney at law I spent M last 20 years

270
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,000
of my life uh dealing with problems uh

271
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,519
about cannabis in practice so I have a

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,078
small comment and a question I would

273
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,440
like to comment that the recreational

274
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,638
usage is not illegal in Slovenia but

275
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,639
possession is so the effect is the same

276
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,639
um also I would like to emphasize that

277
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,278
cultivation uh is legal if you do it

278
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,519
just for yourself or let's say for a

279
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,838
friend who is sick or something uh we

280
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,959
have cases of a Supreme Court that uh

281
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,760
support this statement but I have a

282
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,359
question in Germany before this uh was

283
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,919
it enabling enjoyment maybe prohibited

284
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,519
maybe as misdem or maybe as a criminal

285
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,319
act if you have any information thank

286
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,078
you um I'm sorry can you repeat the

287
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,360
second part of the question but just for

288
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,919
for the grow for the gr enabling

289
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,120
enabling of enjoyment is a criminal act

290
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,639
in Slovenia if I pass join to this

291
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,440
gentleman I'm committing a criminal act

292
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,919
my question is was was it like this in

293
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,000
Germany before was it misdemeanor or a

294
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,559
criminal criminal act if you have any

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,839
ideas

296
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:44,078
um everybody should just roll their own

297
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,639
joints yeah so my position is that uh

298
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,919
growing cannabis for your own is not

299
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,639
legal we have decision from the Supreme

300
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,799
Court saying it's okay in this case he

301
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,278
was growing so much but by law it's

302
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,599
illegal to grow it if you don't have the

303
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,399
license from the uh from the Ministry of

304
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,920
Agriculture it's not legal the law

305
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,480
doesn't say you can grow it for your own

306
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:06,879
the supreme court allows it in some

307
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,278
cases but it's it's illegal so um and

308
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,919
the other part of the question if I

309
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,078
understood correctly if it's a

310
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,360
misdemeanor or a criminal offense to to

311
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:18,000
pass somebody a joint I don't know what

312
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,120
it was like in in Germany uh that's

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,360
maybe a question for for the next

314
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,600
colleague who's coming up was is under

315
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,240
the new regulation you cannot pass a

316
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,720
joint to your friend even if you

317
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,919
cultivated at home okay yeah but is is

318
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,480
is it a misdemeanor or a criminal

319
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,759
offense sorry now a misdemeanor yeah

320
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,278
well very much depending on the on the

321
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,278
quantity

322
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,958
yeah everybody roll your own

323
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,320
joints um it's an observation first

324
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,838
because you know we've travel

325
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:58,560
International with this whole canas

326
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,880
issue and CBD issue and the overall

327
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,518
thing is is

328
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,159
that first it's wonderful that we're

329
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,198

330
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,240
it's been over the last 20 30 40 years

331
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,198

332
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,240
conversations that you br bringing

333
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:18,599
forward which is actually useful to this

334
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,839
is that these policies that we're doing

335
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,800
they're still

336
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,440
repressive aren't they and and so my

337
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,519
overall question to you is that given

338
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,920
that you're the second

339
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,560
in the

340
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:35,639
EU and you're following Germany maybe

341
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,638
this is a better this is a way of taking

342
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,399
a stand to say let's have less

343
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,639
repressive and less repressive issues in

344
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:50,318
the U EU as well I mean this is a this

345
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:54,079
is a a dynamic question for all of us um

346
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:58,318
yeah it's it's a nice idea but as I said

347
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:01,439
I'm my my concerns are or my fear is

348
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:04,479
that if we would take a stance we would

349
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,519
take a bidding from EU commission or

350
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,159
from anybody else

351
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:11,839
because the fact is we are a small

352
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,159
country and it's always easier to to say

353
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,759
no to a smaller member of your community

354
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,078
than to the big fellow and as we heard

355
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,600
Germany got a no more or less on on

356
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,239
their idea so I don't

357
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,680
think my position is if Germany would

358
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,759
have changed it the way they fought

359
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,239
first and just presented the bill to the

360
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,120
to the European commission and say

361
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,720
listen we're doing this it would

362
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,198
probably go through but now that they

363
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,800
ask for permission and they got a no

364
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,679
we're sure not going to get a yes from

365
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,519
Slovenia so that's just my opinion

366
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,000
that's that's the thing about at least

367
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,879
in my experience with governments in

368
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,480
general is they move very very slowly

369
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,000
and it always takes longer than you

370
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,839
think it should take and so we have to

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,120
be patient yet

372
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,920
Relentless right always pushing forward

373
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,639
fighting for for every inch uh every

374
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,639
every meter every centimeter I guess

375
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,679
every 2.5 centimeters would be an inch

376
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,640
and and just be relentless and just keep

377
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,160
pushing and then we we will eventually

378
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,240
win all of us will probably be old by

379
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,000
then but our children will be able to

380
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,640
smoke weed in the streets and there's

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
always a chance to change it later I

382
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,919
mean step step by step step by

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,599
step hi thank you very much for the

384
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:29,679
clarification here in Slovenia um I've

385
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:33,639
got two questions one one is more an

386
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,440
observation um 35 years ago I lived in

387
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,240
um

388
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,640
Holland and um consequently as a result

389
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,240
over the last 20 years I've been

390
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:49,240
involved with um a responsible use

391
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:53,798
towards cannabis or any other drug um so

392
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,079
as part of um

393
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,359
the agencies and and private sector that

394
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:03,399
deal with treatment for addiction

395
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:06,439
and misuse of any drug including alcohol

396
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,840
um in Holland it was a very responsible

397
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,759
approach to legalizing and also trying

398
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,839
to produce the best treatment centers in

399
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,279
the world to help where there was a

400
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:20,199
problem um and they were very Innovative

401
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,639
there uh not just in terms of cognitive

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,840
science uh or the spirituality of what

403
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,759
they were using or or inviting other

404
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:30,359
tried and tested evidence-based methods

405
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,400
um but they seem to have a legalized

406
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,119
policy 35 years ago and and I don't

407
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,640
really and through ignorance understand

408
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,279
why um

409
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,799
there's not some sort of reflection on

410
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,798
what has happened in in Holland um we're

411
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,079
talking about the German model but

412
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:52,918
what's the situation there in the

413
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:55,759
Netherlands at the moment um so from my

414
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,080
information cannabis was always illegal

415
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,279
in Netherlands they used something that

416
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,798
is called in- law the opportunity

417
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,038
principle which means you cannot the

418
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,839
state can decide not to prosecute

419
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,119
something if you look at the bill 10 15

420
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,158
years ago cannabis was illegal even

421
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,558
though they had coffee shops and

422
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,480
everything but cannabis was illegal they

423
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,079
just didn't prosecute it now if I'm not

424
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,079
mistaken they they're starting these

425
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,319
pilot projects now which is funny in a

426
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,798
way to try to figure out how it would

427
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,678
affect the people if you would allow

428
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,519
them to buy cannabis but yes but it was

429
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,759
never legal in in Netherlands so they

430
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,759
did didn't legalize it they just decided

431
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,240
as a state or as a nation not to

432
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,240
prosecute it so that's that's a big

433
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,558
difference in

434
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,960
law thank you for clarifying that and

435
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,879
just lastly the on on this on the other

436
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,038
point what is your policy towards the

437
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,679
responsible legalization of

438
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,960
cannabis um you mean my personal or both

439
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,640
personal or

440
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,000
governmental um well I'm not a member of

441
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,280
the government so just I hope that uh so

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I cannot speak on behalf of the

443
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:05,960
government but I think

444
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,720
that it's clear that the current model

445
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,000
is not working and I'm just not just

446
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,038
talking about Slovenia but globally

447
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,480
prohibition is obviously not working and

448
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,919
we had experience with the prohibition

449
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,558
of alcohol in the United States we saw

450
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,880
how that went the first organized crime

451
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:22,759
presented with the prohibition of

452
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,840
alcohol they didn't have organized crime

453
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,679
before so obviously prohibition is not

454
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,319
working we had worldwide prohibition for

455
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,440
what is it 60 years almost or even more

456
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,240
and it's obviously not working every

457
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,759
every survey shows that cannabis is the

458
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,440
most used illicit drug so obviously it's

459
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,960
not working so we need to try something

460
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,038
new and I think that the the road that

461
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,640
Germany took of course with some

462
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,038
improvements is a nice First Step

463
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,720
because we have to we have to know that

464
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,480
cannabis is still very stigmatized there

465
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,600
is still a lot of position against

466
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,319
legalizing cannabis or making it more

467
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:01,359
approachable uh both on the m medical or

468
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,519
and the recreational sector so I think

469
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,319
taking it step by step while taking into

470
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,440
account that there are a lot of

471
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,038
positions against it that's probably the

472
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,840
right approach but the current the

473
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,759
current model is is obviously not

474
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:16,678
working so we need to change

475
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:19,359
that right here yes just allow me to

476
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,720
comment I think it's a very relevant

477
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:27,719
question about analyzing the

478
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:31,120
Dutch uh Dutch uh experiment let's say

479
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,240
because we have Decades of data

480
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:39,079
prohibition uh became

481
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:42,720
uh came to to to to realization because

482
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:45,480
of the public health risks and public

483
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,400
health scares let's say we said we have

484
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,880
to prohibit certain substances because

485
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:54,080
of the risks in public health so it's

486
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,600
irrelevant in in my view from the public

487
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,839
health point of view whether something

488
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,639
was legal or illegal even though I

489
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,359
understand this is a common argument

490
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,000
about it but we have Decades of data

491
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,119
like nowhere else so I think it's

492
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,679
important to look at it and we do have a

493
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:13,798
very positive outcome of this model even

494
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,880
though it was not legally based so uh

495
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:19,918
legislation is is only another uh Human

496
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,919
Institution now

497
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,360
so yeah yeah

498
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,759
[Music]

499
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:33,439
yeah you sir uh a short question did you

500
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:36,679
happen to check the legislation in

501
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,000
France as another big European

502
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,159
country no I have I have not to be

503
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,359
honest so I don't know but if I'm not

504
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,760
mistaken it's illegal in France or I

505
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,678
don't know to be honest I don't know I

506
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,319
haven't checked it they might be

507
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,960
powerful in changing legislation in

508
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,960
Europe like

509
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,600
Germany perect I don't have to

510
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:05,719
thank hi uh probably you are aware that

511
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,959
there were several attempts of changing

512
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,319
the regulation in Slovenia with regards

513
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,960
medical cannabis also before our

514
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,439
referendum and how do you comment them

515
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,558
and would you take something from them

516
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,798
to uh combine it with a German model or

517
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:25,599
did you find them completely use useless

518
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:28,798
thank you um no as I as I said I think

519
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,798
that the regulation of medical can is

520
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,960
right now in Slovenia is is actually not

521
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,480
bad the problem is mainly the position

522
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,120
of our agency for medicinal products and

523
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,679
their interpretation of the decree on

524
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,599
the D drugs um which in my opinion is is

525
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,038
wrong from from a legal standpoint of

526
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,798
view for for many reasons uh one is that

527
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,640
that's a decree and it cannot be

528
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,798
something that's against the law um that

529
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,559
it just says prescribed in accordance

530
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:56,839
with guidelines but if those guidelines

531
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,119
don't exist that doesn't mean that you

532
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:01,480
cannot prescribe it um second of all as

533
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,719
I said we have guidelines from a whole

534
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,319
variety of countries with comparable U

535
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,960
level of medical care so there is no

536
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:14,119
reason to to not use those um and I

537
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,200
think there are the current Legislation

538
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,798
on medical is not as bad so it doesn't

539
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,200
need that much change it just probably

540
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:23,158
needs clarification

541
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,880
and maybe some explanation on for what

542
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,760
conditions it can be prescribed or just

543
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,200
just to make it clear because currently

544
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:32,119
it's it's a bit of a mess and who do you

545
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,399
think would be the best one to get the

546
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,918
information to doctors what can be

547
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:40,239
prescribed and what not and how and the

548
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:43,360
dosaging and everything who is that um

549
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,038
that one that would could do that I mean

550
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,798
we already have quite some doctors in

551
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:51,000
Slovenia who have excellent expert

552
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,798
knowledge on that questions uh there are

553
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,640
a lot of experts from other countries uh

554
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:57,398
from a while ago I was looking at

555
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,440
literature or gathering literature on

556
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:02,879
that question and there is

557
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,840
I found I think like 30 or 40 textbooks

558
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,320
or three 400 Pages just on cannabis and

559
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,319
cannabis medication for different

560
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:13,359
conditions so I think there is a lot of

561
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,038
a lot of knowledge out there so the

562
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:19,000
doctors it's like with any other thing

563
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,679
they will have to to to learn it um we

564
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,119
were even talking with uh the

565
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,600
universities to include it in the

566
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,119
curriculum at the Medical Faculty

567
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:31,119
because it's something that probably

568
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:32,759
needs to be done and other it's by by by

569
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,000
by gathering that knowledge maybe the

570
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:38,278
medical board should play a role here to

571
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,720
with some educational

572
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:44,278
programs thank

573
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,679
you do we have any more questions do you

574
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:50,119
have one more question

575
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,120
no just just

576
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,798
checking is there anything else you'd

577
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,750
like to say so no thank you all right

578
