24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,039
interesting one we're going to be

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,039
talking about you know conventional

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,120
Industries and like the shift from food

27
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,799
Pharma and consumerism because we've had

28
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,118
so much changes in it um and uh I think

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,560
we're going to find it very interesting

30
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,040
especially with this great panel that I

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,799

35
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,000
problem good morning everyone my name is

36
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,359
Paul long um CEO at little green farmer

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,078
so we are a medical cannabis company

38
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,200
based in Australia and in Europe we um

39
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,839
sit across the entire supply chain so we

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,240
we we provide medical products into uh

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
as I said the Australian Market where

42
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,798
one of the larger

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,439
brands in in that market and we've been

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,439
pretty active in the in the European

45
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,279
market for the last four or five years

46
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:40,319
and we had have a big Side Up in up in

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,920
Denmark that we're producing um the

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,118
topic of commoditization I think we're

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
going to touch on today I think it's

50
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,799
very interesting for us as a company um

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,520
very interesting here in Germany but

52
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,240
also also in Australia and I think for

53
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,000
everyone in the audience you know

54
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,158
understanding what what that means and

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,840
and how that will play out in a market

56
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,000
that's legalizing is going to be an

57
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,200
interesting

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,438

125
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,520
to be here with you all quick Round of

126
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,519
Applause for our

127
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,638
panel awesome so you know we're going to

128
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,439
start uh you know we're talking

129
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,038
backstage with Paul about the the

130
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,800
background of this topic and why it's so

131
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,319
important uh why don't we kind of start

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,960
it off and we'll each one of us will

133
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,319
talk about why this such an important

134
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,959
topic and and why these people should

135
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:15,360
care about it yeah sure I think you know

136
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:17,439
there's some interesting parallels when

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,720
we look at the Australian Market which

138
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
is our our core Market to to the German

139
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,759
market and I think in Australia we've

140
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,639
now got

141
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,400
700 flour products in the market so

142
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,038
heavily commoditized Market at the

143
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:34,159
moment in the last 12 weeks we had 58

144
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,680
new products so in the high THC category

145
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,199
in the last 12 weeks in the Australian

146
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,639
market so um I was I was thinking and

147
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,639
hoping that we might have may have hit

148
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,918
an inflection point last year but it

149
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,560
seems that's not the case in in in our

150
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,879
home market and when I talk to our

151
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,199
partners here in Germany we we're

152
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,839
hearing exactly the same thing so um by

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,400
definition of commoditization it's um

154
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,758
we're going from from high value high

155
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,439
quality products um or more Niche

156
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,400
products into into generic really if

157
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,240
we're talking in Farmer land and I think

158
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,758
I think you know we accept as a company

159
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
that that's that's the markets that

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
we're playing in it's not it's not the

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,319
markets we see across the globe in in

162
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
across the markets we we work in in say

163
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,680
France and Poland as an example but

164
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,598
certainly when we look at Germany and

165
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Australia the the the theory of um

166
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,918
commoditization is is is prevalent um

167
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,560
for us it's got positive and negative

168
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,799
like it's you know you know on a

169
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,199
positive sense we can see in Australia

170
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,680
there's been a real shift to um

171
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,160
accessibility and when we spoke about

172
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,240
medical cannabis in Australia five or

173
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,039
six years ago the problem it was Patient

174
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,199
Advocates saying that we need access and

175
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,719
it's too expensive but now we can see

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,360
that Trend really really shifting so the

177
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,400
cost for a patient has now dropped

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,038
significantly um and and in our Market

179
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,478
we're dealing with with patients and

180
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,399
it's a it's a last resort for people

181
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,758
with chronic Health needs and and those

182
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,719
patients of often cannot work full-time

183
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,560
so you know there's a there's a real

184
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,080
positive behind the commoditization um

185
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,120
and I think we're also seeing a shift

186
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,079
from the black market in in Australia

187
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,240
the there's a survey that's run in

188
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,680
Australia every four years that looks at

189
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,598
um it asks some interesting questions

190
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,280
around around drug use in a very non

191
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,680
deidentified way to to Australian public

192
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,119
and in 2019 they asked the question they

193
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,639
said um for those people that are using

194
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,120
cannabis illicitly what percentage of

195
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
those Pat those so patients using elicit

196
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,639
cannabis for a medical reason what

197
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,038
percentage of those patients actually

198
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,478
got a script through our medical

199
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:33,000
framework and it was 1.8% in 200 19 and

200
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,079
in 2023 just the back half of last year

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,918
it's up to 22% so on on another positive

202
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,680
frame where we're taking we're moving

203
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,758
we're shifting away from the black black

204
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,038
market to to the legal Market I think

205
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,879
commoditization has driven prices down

206
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,959
which means that you know less Black

207
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,560
Market activity more more medical

208
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,839
activity and and I think ultimately in

209
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,000
Australia it'll be no different to

210
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,318
Germany there will be a shift from

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,519
commoditization lower pric product

212
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,759
legalization my personal opinion is that

213
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,198
that's where we're heading you know and

214
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,520
very similar parallels to what we're

215
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,520
saying here in Germany fish yeah I could

216
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,038
Jump Right In because if you look at the

217
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,639
flower price in Germany I mean there are

218
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,000
now websites where you can check flower

219
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,720
price in pharmacies for the same strains

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,839
and you know like the entry point is as

221
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,639
low as €3 for a gram of flour right and

222
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,000
and I talked to many because we work

223
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,800
with many of the importers some of you

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,120
know some of the producers as well um

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,000
and they really see also like an like a

226
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,679
spike just in like all the new stuff

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,599
that's coming in right so the the

228
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,000
proportion of products that they bring

229
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,680
in that need to be everybody in the

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,599
beginning was like oh we need stable you

231
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,879
know stable cultiv ours like stable

232
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,879
stable stable it's not so much that

233
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,958
thing because they really see new stuff

234
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,679
coming in big sales and then it kind of

235
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,919
like Fades out next thing comes in new

236
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,199
sales so that's a consumer Model Market

237
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,199
even though we're in the medical field

238
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,879
technically speaking and you know what

239
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,000
that's a great point so Atlas Global

240
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,679
Brands we export to seven International

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,480
markets and you know it's exactly that b

242
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,439
like you said there's so much changes

243
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,920
but again you know me coming from cpg

244
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,000
and Jack Daniels and Dr Pepper like it

245
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,958
comes down to portfolio management so

246
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,399
there is commoditization but I think at

247
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,879
the end of the day how do you

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,399
differentiate yourself right and you

249
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,519
create the brand positioning it's all

250
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,919
the fundamentals as we look at it to

251
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,320
really create a differentiation so for

252
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,559
example at Atlas we create a uh we have

253
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,200
a nursery program and we pheno hunt and

254
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,599
we make sure we have the best genetics

255
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,879
so that on sites like that our partners

256
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,720
you know you know we're here in Germany

257
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,639
one of our partners like anua as an

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,639
example you partner with them and you

259
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,919
and you create a compelling proposition

260
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,759
where it's the only unique cultivar and

261
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,879
and it's not a me too the moment you

262
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,200
have a me too it's commoditized

263
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,240
everyone's going to have it you're

264
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,079
driven on price so how do you create a

265
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
positioning with your brand whether

266
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:54,759
medical or consumer I mean let's face it

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,799
it's cannabis there's a market in for it

268
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,679
there's there's something that

269
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,919
everyone's looking for so that's really

270
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,679
uh an evolving space that we'll see

271
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,838
here I would like to highlight that this

272
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,519
uh Market is not only a flower market

273
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,560
you're only speaking about flour but we

274
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,959
are speaking about patients we are

275
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,919
speaking about medical market and there

276
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,838
are a lot of people who don't want to

277
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,519
smoke and uh and therefore I think we

278
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,800
should see the market as well that we

279
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,399
that there are uh extract that there are

280
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,639
isolate that there are maybe finished

281
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,200
product at uh at the end in the future

282
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,519
and this is very important for me is

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,040
important the the plant the plant from

284
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,600
is so powerful I really believe we have

285
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,799
we have a lot of indication where we

286
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,480
don't have any chance uh for um to to

287
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,000
find a product of far and I believe that

288
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,600
cannabis is the plant who can deliver

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,720
new uh medication for new indication and

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,159
we are working together with

291
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,200
universities and um uh together with our

292
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,600
clients we are doing clinical studies

293
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,240
and I really hope for the future for the

294
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,079
uh for patients who will have there this

295
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,959
plant will be

296
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,638
so suzan what's your view on that cuz

297
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,838
you know let's talk about the future cuz

298
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,399
I think a lot of us have a lot of

299
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,440
thoughts around you know the Cannabis

300
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,360
Health Products you know when I think of

301
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,920
you know um topical rubs like the A5 35s

302
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,440
of the world you think of you know even

303
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,399
years ago the the big tobacco and Pharma

304
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,760
this is a very important input and uh

305
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,639
and I think there's a lot of to your

306
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,838
point different ways to utilize a

307
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,799
product Beyond combustibles yeah I think

308
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,800
the market will change a little bit in

309
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,519
future so I think there was yesterday as

310
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,519
well a discussion I think in in future

311
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,879
there will be maybe big farmer I don't

312
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,078
know I know big um um tobacco um

313
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,399
companies are looking as well into this

314
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,519
field they will develop finished

315
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,559
products with clinical studies and then

316
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,278
a lot of products will no longer be can

317
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,078
no longer be prescribed in the medical

318
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,639
Market because then there are finished

319
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,599
product and as soon as there are

320
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,560
finished product registered by the local

321
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,920
authorities um then the market will will

322
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:05,278
change uh completely and I think we are

323
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,000
going into this direction um with this

324
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,958
and this maybe you said positive

325
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,919
negative and with this LW change maybe

326
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:16,119
in Germany uh it's maybe easier uh to to

327
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,559
get access uh to the medical Market in

328
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,679
that way that companies will think about

329
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,278
okay now maybe I invest because it's no

330
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:27,319
longer a drug product I'm no longer in

331
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:30,078
this uh um Corner which is um more

332
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,600
cannabis it's it's not supp positive now

333
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,719
I have the impression that more

334
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,959
companies are thinking about to develop

335
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,839
product and this can take five more

336
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,919
years because in this market you always

337
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,920
need to do clinical trials and get a

338
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,519
registration but it will come and then

339
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:50,240
the market will change uh totally yeah

340
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:53,639
no I I double that so at the end if we

341
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,959
really honest right now we using

342
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,198
cannabis flour in a medicinal context

343
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,119
for the lack of better alternative so we

344
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,479
give them like all of the 500

345
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,959
biochemical compounds that are in there

346
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:12,320
because we don't know which 5

347
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:14,078
2535 you need for your specific case

348
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,480
right but at some point we will able to

349
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,159
decipher that and this would be made

350
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,800
into an application at the end of the

351
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,198
day yeah yeah I think it'd be

352
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,599
interesting to Bernie understand your

353
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,319
perspective on commoditization

354
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,159
legalization and what what happened

355
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,600
happened next in your Market but I think

356
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,360
what we see both here in in Germany and

357
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,720
Australia is in some ways the negative

358
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,560
side is actually quite disappointing

359
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,920
because there is a conversation around

360
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,399
flower and it's high THC flour it's not

361
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,759
it's not the doctor it's not the

362
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,879
companies like ours making those

363
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,958
decisions it's the patient walking in to

364
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,919
the doctor with a 7-minute tele Health

365
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,479
consult even less maybe saying I want

366
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:53,078
this high THC flower so we're reacting

367
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,079
one now we're reacting and the markets

368
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,599
reacting and it's responding to to what

369
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,278
the market wants and that is an

370
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,159
inevitable step from commoditization

371
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,078
legalization and and that's the way the

372
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,879
Market's heading and yeah there's

373
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,958
definitely some negatives to that we're

374
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,958
not you know as an industry we're not

375
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,399
doubling down and investing on unique

376
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,000
drug delivery we're not looking at new

377
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,679
formulations we're not we're reacting to

378
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,519
a market and we we're all in a really

379
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,719
difficult Capital Market there's no that

380
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,360
might be a little bit different over

381
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,800
here maybe there's a bit of optimism

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,839
around you know the changes that we've

383
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,919
seen and some Capital available but not

384
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,639
in our world probably Limited in your

385
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,278
your part of the world too so so you're

386
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,198
reacting to the market chasing chasing

387
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,759
Revenue quarter by quarter chasing

388
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,719
profitability as a business so

389
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,720
inevitably the downside is that there is

390
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,440
a lack of innovation for for real

391
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
patients with real product Solutions

392
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,519
unfortunately that's an interesting

393
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,399
point Paul cuz I think you know that's

394
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,519
where we have to all really collaborate

395
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,759
and I think this is that time where you

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,078
know we got to take learnings from

397
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,000
Canada and other markets where you know

398
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:51,239
we've made mistakes and and take those

399
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,399
best practices and adapt them over like

400
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,000
when you think about the product

401
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,600
portfolio you're right everyone's

402
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,839
chasing quarter to quarter you're trying

403
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,399
to find sustainability run a lean

404
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,560
organization but I think I think at the

405
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,600
end of the day when we think of what we

406
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,919
all do together in the shift towards

407
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,639
Pharma and consumerism is you know I

408
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,278
come back to even at Atlas it's like

409
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,720
what are we great at right and all of us

410
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,958
have to find our lane that we want to

411
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,600
own and you know in our case it's really

412
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,679
being a hub and exporting UGM for our

413
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,839
partners in in these types of markets

414
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,838
and and that I think is key but when you

415
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,000
want to try to do everything you end up

416
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,959
not really being an expert and that's

417
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,720
where I think the value chain breaks

418
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,599
down and I encourage you all to think

419
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,639
about that because you know whether it's

420
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,319
in the conversations we're having today

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,480
around you know consumerism and Pharma

422
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:38,958
and medical it's just think about those

423
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,600
key pieces because the

424
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,119
commoditization is is happening so let's

425
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,120
make sure whatever Lane you pick you're

426
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,480
very very efficient at it and productive

427
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,679
at it uh I would like uh to come back to

428
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,278
what Benjamin just said uh here in

429
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,838
Germany now there are

430
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:58,240
Trends and I I think this is maybe a

431
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,880
lesson we haven't learned here in in

432
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,879
Germany there are trends that you can

433
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,759
get now a prescription for1 Euro and uh

434
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,240
they are doing advertisement with a

435
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,159
reper in a pharmaceutical company I'm

436
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,120
happy to smoke I'm happy to smoke I

437
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:17,159
really think this is too much uh this is

438
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,000
I we we had a long fight I I have seen

439
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,719
what is was going on in Germany there

440
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,559
was a long fight and there are parties

441
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,680
they don't like this law and they

442
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,919
directly say within uh um votation next

443
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,638
year we will bring everything back uh to

444
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,679
to the status as today and with this

445
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,600
advertisement I think this is not

446
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,278
helping the market so I really have the

447
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,278
fear that that now maybe politicians say

448
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,480
no this is not what we want uh for for

449
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,360
Germany or that farma um insurance

450
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,959
companies maybe say if this is the

451
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,959
market we will no longer pay uh for uh

452
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,119
for the products we we actually saw that

453
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,919
in the US and uh what happens is if you

454
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,078
kind of make medical a joke kind of with

455
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:00,240
your dollar joint uh dollar gram uh what

456
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,078
happens is when recreational will happen

457
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,879
eventually you'll start to see

458
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,558
recreational people go to recreational

459
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:07,359
and the medical people will actually be

460
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,639
professional and medical and until you

461
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,719
have legalization unfortunately this is

462
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,559
what's going to happen we saw there in

463
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,640
the US we saw there in Canada and

464
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,078
something else we're seeing in Canada

465
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,480
what you said about people just want to

466
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:18,959
how high can I get for the cheapest

467
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,880
price was a very common thing we saw in

468
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,679
Canada and Paul you were talking about

469
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,039
like all these new products in Ontario

470
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,400
my Province we have 3,000 products in

471
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,599
the market and they're talking about

472
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,640
increasing it to 5,000 Bernie's notd in

473
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,839
his he knows how difficult the Canadian

474
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,679
Market is with so many different

475
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,959
products but at least we're diversifying

476
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,720
from flour and I always say that when

477
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,519
the prices come down and the access

478
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,919
increases that's when you'll get rid of

479
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,918
the black market you can't get rid of

480
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,320
the black market by policing no matter

481
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,120
how much you try it won't go away the

482
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,279
only way it'll go away is by giving the

483
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,678
people what they want at the right price

484
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,599
and an easy way uh and with that in mind

485
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,360
and bringing the price down it becomes a

486
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,719
commodity and that's a very important

487
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,199
topic that we're talking about here

488
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,120
sorry Susan before we get into our next

489
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,319
topic you wanted to say something yeah I

490
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,678
want uh yes you're discussing price but

491
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,158
what we can see is that product in the

492
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,919
market the quality is very low so you

493
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:13,120
really you saw you see uh especially uh

494
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,240
flowers but as well in in our area the

495
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,119
exert area the product quality is is so

496
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,038
low that uh let's say we we know there

497
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,558
will be there are products in the market

498
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,919
let's say CBD 5% if we Analyze This

499
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:30,240
there is sometimes there is no CBD

500
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:33,200
inside there is a t t see above the

501
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,240
level so there are are product false

502
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,240
they're false labor totally totally

503
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,240
false and and because the more nobody is

504
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,038
controlling the market so far and as

505
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,839
well for the for flowers um the the

506
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:49,158
flowers are sometimes really really bad

507
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,319
quality and so pricing is one thing but

508
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,320
you know if if you want to get good

509
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:56,519
quality price sometimes needs to be uh

510
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,119
as well I think it's the price value

511
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,960
relationship like you said right but I

512
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:02,839
would say you know I give credit to the

513
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,440
EU here and Australia's you know it

514
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,839
wasn't like Canada where it was like

515
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,360
grow it and sell it and it's going to

516
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,678
move in the beginning when we had

517
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,558
legalization I find the product quality

518
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,440
curve has shut up exponentially and I'm

519
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,038
sure you agree as well here you're right

520
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
on some of the quality dumping and and

521
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,000
commoditization that's shifting some of

522
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,120
the products but I mean patients are are

523
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,159
smart and you know we're all consumers

524
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,439
and you you know you buy at once if it

525
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,280
doesn't meet your price value

526
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,440
relationship you're not going to deliver

527
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,720
that's why it comes back to consistency

528
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,320
and quality of what you want to deliver

529
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,839
and own and be great at and just

530
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,119
consistently do it and you'll tell your

531
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,839
friends about that it's not good and

532
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,199
that's word of melt is very valuable Ben

533
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,279
you wanted to say something yeah but

534
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,440
that's that's a consumer mechanism right

535
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,319
because if you think of if it was a

536
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,120
farmaceutical product the quality would

537
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:54,599
be the effect that it has on your back

538
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,479
pain you know and I think the issu is

539
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,798
also because right now in medicinal we

540
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,319
only look at THC CBD is the only two

541
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,879
active compounds that we really care

542
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:07,319
about and we don't know about the rest

543
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,480
yet right so that's the this is I think

544
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,519
one of the issues and all the mechanism

545
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,839
we see this is this is consumer Market

546
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,519
mechanisms right because at the end is

547
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,879
well if I get a medicine you know and is

548
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,679
what's the quality of a medicine does it

549
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,200
help me or not it's not about how does

550
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,600
it taste you know and all this I mean of

551
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,720
course there is the adherence part of it

552
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,119
of course you know if it's too bitter

553
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,798
your cuff syrup is too bitter you won't

554
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,959
take it bad for you okay like that's

555
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,279
there but the rest of it is just pure

556
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,038
and out and between the strains the

557
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,319
cultivar I exchange it because I like

558
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,079
the flavor better you know a lot of it

559
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,639
has to do with humidity actually too so

560
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,879
we have um like a study of like 1100

561
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,400
data points and the the legal limit was

562
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,039
10% moisture content the average was

563
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,679
seven somewhere in at four you know and

564
00:20:53,038 --> 00:21:00,319
that's really low it's dry that's s is

565
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,919
bad you know but at the end it's will be

566
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,678
interesting to see how that then

567
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,960
translate into legalized Market I agree

568
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,360
with you Alex I mean that's that's how

569
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,120
you get that's right now that you see a

570
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:14,759
rush into the medicinal because of the

571
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,879
lack of a of a recreational alternative

572
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,319
right that's see that for sure Paul last

573
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,559
stop before we get into our next topic

574
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,798
yeah I actually just have a question

575
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,519
probably um Bernie and Alex for you guys

576
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:24,599
that that I'm interested that I think

577
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,918
other people in the audience might

578
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,719
around um Beyond you know Step Beyond

579
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,919
commoditization commoditization

580
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,120
legalization and what's a you know are

581
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,278
there some good examples out there in in

582
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,678
US and Canada that you that you would

583
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,519
guide you know companies like ours or

584
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,679
startups or whatever that looks like in

585
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,200
Australia and and and Germany example I

586
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,159
don't know Bernie good example you know

587
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,919
what I I say it to everyone is like you

588
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,120
can never you know whether it's medical

589
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,360
and cannabis is in medical spaces you

590
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:55,158
can never never um trick the consumer or

591
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,000
the patient you know what I mean deliver

592
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,039
on what you want to have and and I think

593
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,038
there's been in our space

594
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,640
even in the early time is you think you

595
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,440
know hey just get it out the door get it

596
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
out the door and it's just the

597
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,600
consistency the quality the price value

598
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,519
relationship many of you highlight the

599
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,240
humidity and quality of the product like

600
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,079
all of the stuff kind comes in handy

601
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,319
like I always use the analogy of the

602
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,399
five senses with cannabis right like

603
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,079
it's you know you open it and you see it

604
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,038
and you touch it you smell it you taste

605
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,558
it It ultimately evolves and and I think

606
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,839
the key learnings is just what you put

607
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,759
in the bag is if you were to buy any

608
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,278
product off that Market would you be

609
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,319
proud of its consistency and I think it

610
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:38,558
comes down to that for sure the question

611
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:41,558
is if the consumer or patient always see

612
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,960
the quality sometimes maybe they think

613
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:47,599
oh it could help for this disease or for

614
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,600
this pain or I don't know and and oh it

615
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:53,558
doesn't help so no cannabis is not good

616
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:55,519
uh and uh and I will tell this uh to my

617
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,558
colleague so it can really reduce the

618
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,400
market because if if the quality is not

619
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:01,319
there if the product is not inside what

620
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
they are

621
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:07,079
selling putting on on the package then

622
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,519
this can ruin the the full Market

623
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,000
because then people are thinking okay

624
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,960
this is nothing for me but I think uh we

625
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,919
have done a big big step ahead uh in in

626
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,558
the European Union because there was a

627
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,759
creation of a monograph uh this year for

628
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,278
the CBD isolator and I think this is

629
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:28,038
perfect for for for patients for for the

630
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:30,640
quality because now we have a monograph

631
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:33,798
and and every product in this market and

632
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:37,240
everybody every Pharmacy who's who needs

633
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:41,079
uh to take um to formulate with with the

634
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,480
um isolate of of CBD now needs to follow

635
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,720
this regulation this specification and

636
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,558
this will be perfect so a lot of

637
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,278
products will need to get out of the

638
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:51,879
market and I think everybody who would

639
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,798
like to think about oh I will develop a

640
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,679
product and do stability data they

641
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:57,558
really now need to think about which

642
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,919
product to start with this need to

643
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:02,240
comply to this mon graph this is uh I

644
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,038
think it's a step ahead and I think this

645
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,798
will follow and this is not only good

646
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:09,240
for Europe I think as well other uh

647
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,720
authorities will follow uh the example

648
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,558
it's it's going to really take it

649
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,120
doctors to take it seriously uh I've

650
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,278
been doing a lot of doctor education

651
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,479
throughout my career 10 years and at the

652
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:18,759
beginning they said there's not enough

653
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,278
information there's not enough evidence

654
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,119
there is no monograph like I heard that

655
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:23,240
all the time so the fact that it does

656
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,000
have it will really help in its

657
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,640
credibility and you were kind of asking

658
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,398
the question I think one of the big

659
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,559
parts and the challenges around our

660
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,239
industry is in the regulations there's a

661
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:36,038
lot of expenses in in being a legal

662
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,480
company eug GMP all these costs with

663
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,079
these costs require investment then you

664
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,720
take investment on and then the clock

665
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,240
starts ticking of you got to start

666
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,759
paying the back of that investment so

667
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,519
you're really rushing to try and be able

668
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,038
to survive long enough until you can

669
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,759
give the customers what they want and

670
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,079
the patients what they want and that's a

671
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,640
big Challenge and that kind of goes into

672
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,879
our next topic around the

673
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,880
commoditization of this product so

674
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,120
there's good and bad with it yes the

675
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,960
patient get a cheaper more affordable

676
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,959
product but then how do we make our

677
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,079
money back to pay back the investors

678
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,240
because if the investors aren't

679
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,558
interested they're going to go put their

680
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,000
money in something else uh and then we

681
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,119
can't even operate these businesses

682
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,839
because it's so expensive to operate so

683
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,158
commodity the good and the bad uh I I

684
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,879
know Paul you had some thoughts on it

685
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,440
and some others as well backstage uh you

686
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,840
know give give the audience some pros

687
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,679
and cons of what this looks like uh

688
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,319
commoditizing this product you have

689
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,640
probably touched on a few already but

690
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:33,639
one to add might be just just you sort

691
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,399
of touched on it around U how business

692
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,559
can operate in that space and I think

693
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:40,079
you know with commoditization we've got

694
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,639
you know proliferation of of Brands and

695
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,678
businesses and new startups every every

696
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,720
week by by the sound of it you know in

697
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,399
in the Australian example it's very easy

698
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,519
to to bring a product and put a label on

699
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:54,038
it so um it it does make it incredibly

700
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,158
difficult to to operate um and it's a

701
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:56,839
different layer of thinking for

702
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,320
businesses I mean we as a company have

703
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:01,599
started from a from a pure farmer

704
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,038
perspective because we were we were that

705
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,519
that was the environment in which we

706
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,839
operated and we still continued to

707
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,599
operate in that in that environment but

708
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,798
um we've been we've been you know we've

709
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:15,038
had to start to think more fmcg as as an

710
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:17,359
industry as a as a company um but yeah

711
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,359
that that that's a different um

712
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,119
commercial proposition for us as a

713
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,839
business and our strategy and our

714
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,918
shareholders so I think I think we're

715
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,199
seeing you know we probably haven't seen

716
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,759
it too much over here and um there may

717
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,278
be some some different views but

718
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,480
certainly in Australia we're seeing

719
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:33,960
companies not not being able to to

720
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,440
operate in that space because it is it

721
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,278
relies on volume it relies on margin it

722
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,480
relies on branding it relies on

723
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,558
Obviously good quality product to to the

724
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,960
patient um so yeah on the on the

725
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,918
negative side it's difficult to operate

726
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,360
in that space But but you know we all in

727
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,880
this industry should think what's right

728
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,839
for the patient and and ultimately I

729
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,600
still think on the balance of positive

730
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,918
and negative that you know there is some

731
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:56,719
there's some some real positives behind

732
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,000
access for patients and affordability

733
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,440
for patients so um you know overall I

734
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,200
think that we're we're trending in the

735
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,399
right direction I do hope that there's a

736
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,759
there's a future where there's a bit of

737
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:07,479
a carve out for in our in our part of

738
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,839
the world there's legalization that that

739
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,599
medical continues to have a space

740
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,199
because I think that the medical part

741
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,158
and what what you know we were

742
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,519
previously delivering and thinking about

743
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,080
was was producing you unique products

744
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,278
and and drugs thinking about drug

745
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:23,720
registration thinking about solving real

746
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:26,240
patient problems um and it's a different

747
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,839
Strate strategic thinking in a boardroom

748
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
um when you look at both of those so I

749
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,240
do hope but there's a there's a future

750
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,759
world that there is a split between

751
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,679
legalized legalized pathway medical

752
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,200
pathway and that the medical pathway has

753
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,559
the right investment to invest in

754
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,759
research and development and really

755
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:41,879
focus on those that's a good point

756
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,359
they're very different you know medical

757
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,039
is one side very Pharma and then there

758
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,558
cpg which is very different something

759
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,038
that Bernie knows a lot about the very

760
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,480
different worlds for sure uh some other

761
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,240
thoughts on the good and bad of

762
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,319
commodity housing it so because I mean

763
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,919
we have like our product is a

764
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,359
commodity do you like do you know what

765
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,519
our biggest competitor is in a cannabis

766
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:05,798
space it's actually people people using

767
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:09,960
nothing right they just know they just

768
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:12,119
like dry weed sucks that's and that's it

769
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,360
they still smoke it you know and in

770
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,119
other places in uh in the cigar space

771
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,398
where we we originate from 25 years our

772
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,918
biggest competitor is basically a

773
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:24,839
sponge right so it's a highly

774
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,278
commoditized business so but at the end

775
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,359
of the day is and that's like for every

776
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:33,599
consumer Market is is you have to build

777
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:36,359
your selling proposition right and your

778
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,519
brand in order to convince people that

779
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,558
you have the right solution for what

780
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,839
they need and we are the most expensive

781
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,079
solution in the

782
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,879
market but we are also the best solution

783
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,599
in the market when it comes to you know

784
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,120
delivering on point um and it's IP

785
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,639
protected so everybody else who we

786
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,959
created this Product Industry really and

787
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,440
we've seen last 25 years a lot of me too

788
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,399
products they're here at the show as

789
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,759
well you know but in the last 5 years

790
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,079
we've seen a lot of them come and go

791
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,200
yeah so it's for us and it's interesting

792
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:07,599
to see and then my question would be for

793
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,278
you guys um how easy would it be for you

794
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:13,119
to like pivot you know because flower

795
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:14,839
could be a recreational product yeah so

796
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,599
how easy would it for you to to Pivot

797
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,879
for you it will be a little bit more

798
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:23,119
difficult you know but then so in theory

799
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,760
there's a way right either and in each

800
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,639
uh industry for you guys at the end I

801
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,640
mean I I find the biggest change if you

802
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,640
think about Canada we were medic first

803
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,600
and then we shifted to Canadian

804
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,038
legalization but excuse me I think the

805
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,000
the thing that we got to think about is

806
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,640
there's the rapid growth of the macro

807
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,880
industry the behaviors of our patients

808
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,440
and what they expect and what they want

809
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,919
from Cannabis is has always been there

810
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,360
like you got to remember we're yes we're

811
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,480
creating some products but we're also

812
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,879
converting the illicit Market over to

813
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,558
Medical for consistency and quality of

814
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,159
product and that's kind of the thing

815
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,558
when I think about Brands and whether

816
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,240
it's on the medical side like yes you've

817
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,119
got the traditional Pharma the API you

818
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,880
know the apotex is when we're in in

819
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,639
Canada and whatnot and other large ones

820
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,880
but really the key thing that I see here

821
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,480
is you can still brand and you can still

822
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,799
create a brand affinity and and what

823
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
does that product deliver and I think

824
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,759
consumers and the medical space and

825
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,319
patients they'll continue to do that and

826
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,278
have expectations so again it's

827
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,000
portfolio building it's understanding

828
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,240
how each one of the um pieces segment to

829
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,119
your actual patient I think are very

830
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,038
very important and yes a lot of it's

831
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,239
from fmcg but you know even in a lot of

832
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,640
the partners I've worked with in the

833
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,120
past in the pharmac set is like what's

834
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,799
the solution you're delivering what's

835
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,239
the need State you're meeting and if you

836
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:44,679
nail that every single time you're going

837
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,919
to have a patient base and yes there's

838
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,038
commoditization and on on me too but

839
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,278
it's those that are going to be able to

840
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:52,759
balance the volume the quality the price

841
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,480
value relationship and ultimately that

842
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,119
product that the consumer and patient

843
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,038
wants is going to win every time and

844
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:59,319
Susan I know you you have an interesting

845
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,119
perspective here cuz actually this

846
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,480
commoditization might actually be a

847
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,798
benefit for you because you have a

848
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,440
product that creates standardization and

849
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,798
quality and it it doesn't require

850
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,960
growing maybe uh you know with the same

851
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,759
type of cost so maybe this

852
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,399
commoditization could be good and by the

853
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,119
way think about some questions from the

854
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:16,278
audience uh so Susan will give her

855
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,000
answer and then if anyone has any

856
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:20,079
questions we'll uh we'll take them there

857
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,839
go ahead I I would like come back to

858
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:26,720
your question um people need to earn uh

859
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,879
money uh and maybe investors are no

860
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,519
longer willing to to to spend their

861
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,480
money and I have the feeling the

862
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,079
industry is changing now a lot of

863
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,038
companies start uh to to leave the

864
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,558
market I believe there will be more

865
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:43,038
companies uh leaving the market and

866
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,558
quality and and what we said um

867
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:48,278
standardization it's it's not it's not

868
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:50,398
cheap so you really need uh to have the

869
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:52,319
money to do stability data we have

870
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,599
stability data for five years but this

871
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,359
is an investment of hundred of thousands

872
00:31:54,599 --> 00:32:00,079
of uh um of uh Euro and I I believe a

873
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,879
lot of companies will leave the market

874
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:05,720
and therefore there will be if if you

875
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,440
really think to to start to do something

876
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,839
in the long run you need to see which

877
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,480
company will be in the market in the

878
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:13,480
future yeah and we saw that in Canada uh

879
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,960
so many companies started and now every

880
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,880
year we have more companies leaving than

881
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,200
joining so that's something that we're

882
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,519
seeing and and one of the big things

883
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,278
around commod commoditization is the

884
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,359
marketing restrictions really make it

885
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,200
difficult for us to differentiate

886
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,240
ourselves from everyone else so how do

887
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,840
you kind of separate plus customers only

888
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,359
really understand THC so we have to

889
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,319
really create a more knowledgeable

890
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,038
customer uh and allow for some education

891
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,359
around products you know not marketing

892
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:41,398
obviously advertising is not going to be

893
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,479
allowed ever but uh finding other ways

894
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:45,158
to educate people on why your product is

895
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,519
better and I think that's going to be a

896
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,080
way to differentiate yourself uh and uh

897
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,880
I don't know Ben you look like you have

898
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,759
a I just I'm just to finish that you're

899
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,840
right I mean at the end of the day the

900
00:32:53,759 --> 00:33:01,119
good thing about commoditization is the

901
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:03,599
consumer has now a choice and if that

902
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:06,558
choice is I want to sacrifice quality

903
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,398
over price that's the choice and the

904
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,079
challenge is of course as you said where

905
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,839
do you fit in and all that entire

906
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,000
spectrum that is how do you make

907
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:18,158
yourself stand out and explain right

908
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,759
education why your product is worth what

909
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,278
you ask for otherwise you're just a

910
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,679
commodity and then you're you're

911
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:23,798
compared equally to everyone else and

912
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,399
then people want to know what's the best

913
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:27,519
price on that commodity uh any uh any

914
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,239
questions from the audience I have a few

915
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,679
other questions here for the panel but

916
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,919
wanted to open it up if anyone has any

917
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,919
questions first I see one right

918
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,319
there don't don't be shy we got a good

919
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:46,519
group up here hello

920
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:49,879
um look I am from Russia Yuri and I plan

921
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:54,200
hemp before before in the Russia hemp

922
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,120
uses only for fiber and four seats now I

923
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,919
here find out that CBD is very popular

924
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,839
in whole

925
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:05,600
world and uh a lot of Advantage we are

926
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:09,440
talking about CBD here THC I don't touch

927
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:14,799
at all so and if anybody think how CBD

928
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:18,039
destroys the body in future how it's

929
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:22,720
nobody talk about disadvantage of CBD if

930
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:25,079
any disadvantage that you are uh

931
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,039
declare uh are you are you uh saying

932
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,760
that you've heard there are some

933
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,639
disadvantages of CBD uh yes yes so I

934
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,960
mean I can speak to one in my Pharmacy

935
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,480
we do med checks there and we found that

936
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,720
certain blood thinners if you take CBD

937
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,960
it makes the blood thinner less

938
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,559
effective so uh I always tell people we

939
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,599
don't really say that CBD is completely

940
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,878
safe it does have some negative things

941
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,760
especially for people on certain

942
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,918
medications uh and also the other

943
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,520
negative with CBD is what carrier oil

944
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:52,719
it's mixed with some people with like

945
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,398
MCT oil or coconut oil can cause like

946
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,799
diarrhea so it makes like stomach upset

947
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:58,159
uh but that's not the CBD that's more

948
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,599
the carrier oil I don't know if anyone

949
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,319
else on the panel has any kind of

950
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,880
thoughts on that yeah yeah I would uh so

951
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,599
so for me you you see this is maybe this

952
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,000
is not commodity so for me this is It's

953
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:13,039
a product that works like any other

954
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,239
pharmaceutical ingredient but it's a

955
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,320
pharmaceutical for me it's a

956
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,879
pharmaceutical ingredient and if I take

957
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,960
something sometimes you have as well

958
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,280
some negative output but I need to say

959
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:27,119
our products we are delivering to Brazil

960
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,240
and um and in Brazil um the the CBD is

961
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,800
given to children with epilepsy and it

962
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:36,759
works so good so and and so effective so

963
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,119
that uh maybe this is not oh I I like to

964
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,839
have uh this only to to feel a little

965
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,800
bit better but you should see it like a

966
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,000
product that really works that really

967
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,280
helps but maybe you should not take it

968
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,358
uh only for fun and and then uh you you

969
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,560
need uh then nothing fun about CBD it's

970
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:56,279
a it's real medicine actually maybe one

971
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,279
negative I want to say about CBD that's

972
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,519
very bothering me is in the the Us and

973
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,480
other places how it's like a novelty I

974
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:04,759
go to the US and they put in hamburgers

975
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,960
and and tampons and they're like they're

976
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,079
putting CBD and everything and it's

977
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,920
become more of like a a novelty than a

978
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,359
real medical product and that really

979
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
bothers me and that's that's probably

980
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,000
the biggest negative of CBD is because

981
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,000
it's legal in these jurisdictions people

982
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,559
have kind of put them in funny shaped

983
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,239
gummies and oh buy your CBD flow and

984
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,039
it's like no this is not what it's for

985
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:26,598
smoking CBD is probably literally the

986
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,119
worst way of getting your CBD so and and

987
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,920
just one more to add from from my

988
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,400
perspective we' we've supplied I think

989
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:37,800
over 70,000 units of our CBD 50 oil in

990
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,720
an MCT carrier to the French pilot study

991
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,440
and and under that study that we're

992
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,959
measuring Pharmaca vigilance we have to

993
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,760
do that through through the uh the

994
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,480
French regime and and there was no

995
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,240
serious over that threeyear period there

996
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,039
was no serious incidents um but there

997
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,919
are you know there's quite a few on

998
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,960
record of of minor incidents which I

999
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,760
think um Alex has mentioned so diarrhea

1000
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,480
vomiting but but again often link to the

1001
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,720
carry oil but nothing nothing major that

1002
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,000
we've seen in that

1003
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,159
market no good good question thank you

1004
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,719
and yeah very interested to see what's

1005
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,118
happening in Russia I don't hear too

1006
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,719
much about it but I love seeing new

1007
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,760
countries uh come to ICBC and hey you're

1008
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,239
the first Russian I meet here at ICBC

1009
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,119
hopefully we'll have a chance to chat

1010
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,719
I'd love to learn more um any other

1011
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,559
questions right here I have a question

1012
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,639
for Bernie you briefly mentioned working

1013
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:22,920
before for Brands like Jack Daniels and

1014
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,358
Dr Pepper and there's a lot of

1015
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,119
similarities between that and the

1016
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:27,960
Cannabis industry what would you say are

1017
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,838
the biggest difference between those

1018
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,720
kinds of Brands and products and and the

1019
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,039
Cannabis industry I say we I think we

1020
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,639
definitely and that's a great question

1021
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,119
we definitely forget how long it takes

1022
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,199
to build a brand and trust with patients

1023
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,838
and consumers like you know I think Jack

1024
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,279
Daniel's now what 160 170 years now

1025
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,440
right it's synonymous with whiskey I

1026
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,880
mean it's a very challenging I find

1027
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,240
building brands in this time that's why

1028
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,920
it's really the step by step and Alex

1029
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,078
mentioned it too around you know what

1030
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,039
you upset one consumer the ripple effect

1031
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,839
of Reddit and all of that its

1032
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:01,838
implication so that's kind of why when

1033
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,119
when we all look together you know it's

1034
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,039
changed so much I've been in the space

1035
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,640
now for seven plus years and what I say

1036
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,440
now is we need to find our Partnerships

1037
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,199
we need to be you know real honest with

1038
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,119
each other and say again what are we

1039
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,159
great at let's work together and build

1040
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,960
and shape the industry now and and I

1041
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,039
think that's what we're seeing a lot of

1042
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,800
even here at the ICBC when I talk to a

1043
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,039
lot of uh great people it's just how do

1044
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,200
we do this better and how do we have a a

1045
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,000
consistent Global Supply Chain we talk

1046
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,078
about CBG like let's talk about

1047
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,719
McDonald's the French fry whether it's

1048
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,039
here Canada China wherever it's the same

1049
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,838
it's consistent and I think that's what

1050
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,679
all of us want to get to and we really

1051
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,679
just got to be thoughtful on that

1052
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:49,000
approach hi everybody great panel my

1053
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:51,159
question relates to what uh consistent

1054
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,239
and successful consumer product

1055
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:55,759
regulation must offer to companies in

1056
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,000
order to make it work because I think an

1057
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,240
impression that a lot of people in

1058
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,199
Germany have is that that market Dynamic

1059
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:03,479
of bringing in new products that deflate

1060
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,199
rather quickly and companies that have

1061
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,800
an ultra high cash burn rate who are you

1062
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,118
know must make this kind of money to

1063
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,079
keep up with this circulation but

1064
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:15,318
cannabis and or THC as an ingredient is

1065
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,359
the actual interesting thing assuming it

1066
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:19,480
follows the same logic as tobacco where

1067
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,519
we're getting away from tobacco products

1068
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,280
and more towards a nicotine based

1069
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,039
regulation and different forms of

1070
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,000
consumption that must be the goal in my

1071
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,239
personal opinion for cannabis to be

1072
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,519
successful in the long run and

1073
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:37,039
Achieve High Revenue per unit uh sales

1074
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,199
that are sustainable enough how can

1075
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,318
Regulators enable industry and set them

1076
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,239
up for success and at some point uh

1077
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:46,880
drawing from lessons from Canada which

1078
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,679
probably don't need to be replicated in

1079
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,480
other parts of the world

1080
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:54,118
to at the same time open a market but

1081
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,519
also protect it from the Dynamics that

1082
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,838
makes it eat itself or destroy itself in

1083
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,119
the long run I I want to ask this panel

1084
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:03,318
because that's an interesting question

1085
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,599
because there's a theoretical view right

1086
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,079
and there's a practical View and you

1087
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,720
said it too cash burn managing your

1088
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,680
day-to-day operations and whatnot is

1089
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,919
it's really finding the right mix of the

1090
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:17,559
portfolio I find like let's face it in

1091
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,480
the next near term you got to sell flour

1092
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,358
like you can talk about the API very

1093
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,679
important and there's the medium and the

1094
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,279
long run development but if you want to

1095
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,239
survive and sustain like even in Canada

1096
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,720
today you got got you know in a more

1097
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,838
mature Market where there's 2.0 products

1098
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,519
can't you know flowers just under 50% of

1099
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:36,119
all the volume still right now it's

1100
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:39,199
pre-rolls and that's and then Plus

1101
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,920
pre-rolls on top with the 18% like so

1102
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,559
when you look at it there's a lot of

1103
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,880
those pieces but where I want to get to

1104
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,440
is really around uh the balance of yes

1105
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,440
there's a longterm in helping making

1106
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,280
sure we're all contributing as a group

1107
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,639
shaping the space and making this a

1108
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,760
really long-term sustainable Market on

1109
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:57,920
the global front and I think uh there's

1110
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,359
a lot of uh pieces that we have to run

1111
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,039
but you know that's a probably a

1112
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,119
separate topic that that can have a lot

1113
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,719
of dialogue I'm interested in everyone's

1114
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,079
view because you want to build it but

1115
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,000
you got to keep the lights on and you

1116
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,960
got to balance that and that's a tricky

1117
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,719
balance for sure we can definitely talk

1118
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,679
about it for a while I see Ango over

1119
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,279
here it looks like maybe our our time is

1120
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:21,000
uh our time is up our panel was

1121
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,880
fantastic let's hear it

1122
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,599
again Alex

1123
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,800
Revit Bernie young Suzanne Caspar and

1124
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:29,519
Benjamin

1125
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,920
that was wonderful that was fantastic

1126
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,559
and I'm sure you can talk to them in the

1127
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,280
hallway if you'd like to talk to them

1128
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,279
some more
