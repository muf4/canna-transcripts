20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:03,340
ICBC and attending this wonderful

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:06,280
conference so my name is Kirk I used to

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,030
be a lawyer in the cannabis space I had

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,299
the great good fortune of representing

24
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,980
Owen Smith in a case there rose out of a

25
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,239
bust

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,130
he was baking cookies for the Vancouver

27
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,549
cannabis buyers Club of Canada one of

28
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:24,250
the first compassion clubs in Canada and

29
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:28,149
he unfortunately ran into problems with

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,920
the authorities because at the time not

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,510
only we're compassion clubs illegal but

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,030
the medical cannabis system did not

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,620
allow for anyone to consume cannabis in

34
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,570
any way other than dried flowers

35
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,700
essentially couldn't have derivative

36
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,589
products a panel like this one would

37
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:47,170
have been you know sort of a distant

38
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:48,760
dream back then in 2012 and so we we

39
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,350
took a challenge on behalf of the club

40
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,510
and Owen all the way the Supreme Court

41
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:53,798
of Canada we won at the trial court

42
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,180
level we went at the Court of Appeal

43
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,560
level and I'm pleased that we won

44
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,049
unanimously in the Supreme Court of

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,180
Canada and the restrictions to dried

46
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,549
cannabis only we're stricken and I think

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,200
that but for Owens work and the

48
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,349
witnesses in that case none of us would

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,908
be up here today and so I I salute him

50
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,360
and I note that the club continues to

51
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:14,469
operate outside of the regulatory scheme

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,480
as trying to do its best for its

53
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,430
patients we heard a lot earlier about

54
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,768
the possibilities of challenges

55
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,000
constitutional challenge is to come for

56
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:26,680
mr. Conroy and and in bringing access to

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,658
the full spectrum of derivative products

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,968
the medical cannabis consumers and that

59
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:32,590
work continues and it's important and

60
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:35,378
vital work and I think we need to pay

61
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,348
homage to it so we're here to talk about

62
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:40,810
changes that are coming in just a few

63
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:43,568
short days really there's a new

64
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,819
regulatory environment coming for

65
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:47,438
derivative cannabis products and we're

66
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:51,068
not talking about new products but we

67
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:52,388
are talking about new rules and many

68
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:54,098
have suggested that perhaps there are

69
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:57,189
too many rules or those rules are too

70
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:59,408
restrictive that was alluded to in the

71
00:02:57,188 --> 00:03:01,598
in the prior panel and possibility of a

72
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:03,370
constitutional challenge and so we're

73
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,840
gonna try to divide this panel into

74
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,849
three topics and get through those

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,950
topics in a manner that allows us to

76
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:11,378
answer some questions towards the end if

77
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,298
we don't do that

78
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:15,489
grab any one of us out in the hallway

79
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,530
we're all happy to chat later and

80
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,688
throughout the day so we're gonna talk

81
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,549
about safety and compliance we're gonna

82
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:23,530
talk about the rollout that's coming

83
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,479
over the next few months of these new

84
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,759
products and educating consumers and

85
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,650
regulators and then we're gonna talk

86
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,418
about the challenges and opportunities

87
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,109
that are posed for branding and

88
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:36,250
marketing for companies in this space so

89
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,799
let's start with safety and compliance

90
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,479
in the rule set so we understand you

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,760
know what what are the rules of the road

92
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,729
what are the rules of the game we heard

93
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,548
earlier that there is a some would say

94
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:52,389
fairly low limit on the amount of THC or

95
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:54,849
CBD that can be in package good edible

96
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:56,409
products and there's also some marketing

97
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,908
restrictions that are in place and child

98
00:03:56,408 --> 00:04:00,310
safety restrictions that are in place

99
00:03:57,908 --> 00:04:02,408
and we'll start off at the far end with

100
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,289
Brandon give us a give a sort of a

101
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:07,438
overview of what are the rule sets what

102
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:10,000
are the biggest challenges posed as

103
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,668
industry moves into this space yeah

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,780
thanks Kirk so I think last panel we

105
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,609
heard everyone talking about the ten

106
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,680
milligram THC limit and obviously that's

107
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,209
gonna be a big one it's not gonna solve

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,918
the problem for medical consumers up

109
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,418
front and we're gonna have to work hard

110
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,978
to push back against that and see what

111
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:26,740
we can do to to make it available for

112
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:28,598
medical consumers but the one piece of

113
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,000
the rules that I do really like is so

114
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:33,879
far they proposed an unlimited limit on

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,348
CBD content we know that CBD is the next

116
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,120
big thing coming up we know that it has

117
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:40,839
tremendous medical office efficacy in

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,399
many areas and the ability to really for

119
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,079
unlimited product formats in that

120
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,929
category is really what excites us a lot

121
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,060
it allows for just so much more dynamic

122
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,848
products and so much more availability

123
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,889
as well we've racine recent regulations

124
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:55,449
or proposed regulations released in the

125
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,908
CHP product which is going to be a

126
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,800
combination of CBD and natural health

127
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:01,000
product of course it's still gonna

128
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,110
contain cannabis so it's still gonna

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,550
have to be distributed through the

130
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,740
provinces and through the the normal

131
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,240
cannabis channels but again opening up a

132
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,639
lot more product categories and a lot

133
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,740
more options this field as we heard in

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,199
the last panel is regulated at multiple

135
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,060
levels of government and so Byrd I'll

136
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,759
ask you because you do have experience

137
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,250
in provincial regulatory policy how are

138
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,740
the various provincial governments going

139
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,838
to help ensure that edibles for example

140
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,389
are a sufficient quality and have

141
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:34,209
accurate measurements THC and CBD and

142
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,848
are also free of chemicals and possible

143
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,319
contaminants such as pesticides from the

144
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:42,310
plants that are growing to make these

145
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,560
value-added product that's a good that's

146
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,538
a good question and I'm a bit of a

147
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,560
misfit on this panel because I come from

148
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:51,819
30 years of government regulation and

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,889
first of all running the cabinet

150
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,750
Secretariat for premier bill Bennett and

151
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:57,579
then I was general manager of the Liquor

152
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,310
Control Licensing branch for several

153
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:04,389
years in the last 30 years

154
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:06,610
consulting in liquor licensing when the

155
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,769
rollout of cannabis came about we got

156
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,569
involved with it mainly because we felt

157
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,978
that we saw what was going to happen is

158
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,930
going to be the same regulators to

159
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:16,689
regulate liquor going to be regulating

160
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,889
cannabis now same process a same

161
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:23,259
approach and from my perspective on this

162
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,050
topic is a lot of work still needs to be

163
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,728
done during the last several years I've

164
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,528
gone to a lot of cannabis conferences

165
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:31,478
and there aren't a lot of people here at

166
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:33,069
these conferences from government I

167
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,288
don't know if there's anybody here from

168
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,699
the liquor of a branch or a liquor

169
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:38,740
cannabis branch or if there's anyone

170
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,730
here from the cannabis distribution

171
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,530
branch or if they're willing to show it

172
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,319
or if they're willing to show it yeah

173
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,359
and we find that there's a null AK of

174
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,719
dialogue between the people in the

175
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,310
industry and you folks who have been in

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,460
the industry of the last umpteen years

177
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,189
are to cannabis what NASA is to space

178
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:59,959
you know what's going on and what we

179
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,699
find that there's a lack of a dialogue

180
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,289
you have government making rules and

181
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:06,379
when I was in government we used to have

182
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:10,730
this saying which was don't start vast

183
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:13,310
plans with half-assed ideas and we often

184
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,280
find that sometimes things rolled out in

185
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,829
government and they didn't consider all

186
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,049
the consequences or what we would call

187
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:23,810
the unintended consequences that's what

188
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,699
I'm concerned about here there needs to

189
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,160
be more dialogue I'm glad to see that

190
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,740
the industry is starting get motivated

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,960
and organized and it was on the previous

192
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,360
panel he's working hard to create a KERS

193
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,889
Association of cannabis retailers to

194
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,230
Lobby the government but it's way it's

195
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,629
going to have to go now with respect to

196
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:45,050
the issue of quality it's going to be

197
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,969
it's a huge issue now we had one client

198
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,600
who went to the government can of a

199
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,280
store here and bought eight products he

200
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,439
took him to an independent lab to have

201
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,469
him tested one product came back

202
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,689
positive for pesticides and only one

203
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,580
product was accurate in terms of what it

204
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:04,370
was labeled all the other the other

205
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:07,129
remaining six had the wrong THC levels

206
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,019
so when you bring in into the world of

207
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,509
edibles that's going to be a huge factor

208
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:14,899
and the other problem we have right now

209
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:17,269
on the liquor side is filling the

210
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,759
pipeline with product and you might have

211
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:23,569
heard that the BC government appointed

212
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,250
an independent review the distribution

213
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,589
system for liquor because the private

214
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,699
liquor store industry and restaurants

215
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,979
have been complaining that they're

216
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,659
gaining cross stock shortages the

217
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,310
product they order like a new Scotch

218
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,379
release or something like there are wine

219
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,089
release they don't get it or they want

220
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,159
to get half of it and I can see that

221
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,660
happening with edibles filling the

222
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,370
demand and I think the uptake for

223
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:47,120
edibles is going to be huge particularly

224
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:50,810
with older people and can they provide

225
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,470
the product safely quickly with a

226
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:54,149
shelf-life

227
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:58,129
to the retailer's that is accurate

228
00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:01,019
terms of its chemical composition or its

229
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:02,490
quality and that to me is huge and I

230
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,100
would like to see more dialogue with

231
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,500
with industry on this point

232
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,139
so actually Kirk I won't jump in on two

233
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,850
points there first the there was a

234
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,129
recent study done on about 1500 people

235
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,649
that showed of the four million cannabis

236
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:18,600
users in Canada I would this the new

237
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,159
regulations and edibles and vapes and so

238
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,110
forth would add an additional three

239
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,209
million users so we are definitely gonna

240
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,590
see a new crowd jumping in the second

241
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,120
point I wanted to add was on the topic

242
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,430
of quality control and industry

243
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,620
associations more recently there was a

244
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:33,559
conference that was called the c-45

245
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,820
conference that was specific to

246
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,619
upholding the standards of production of

247
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,860
various things and edibles was a big

248
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,690
topic at that the idea behind it is a is

249
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,820
an industry association that advocates

250
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,560
for high quality products advocates for

251
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,300
production standards and that we

252
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,699
specifically recommended that they

253
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,769
advocate for lab testing standards that

254
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,300
are standard across Canada I've been lab

255
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,789
testing edibles now for almost four

256
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,500
years and it's obvious that not

257
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:59,610
everybody does it the same and that it

258
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,679
that's a huge problem in the industry

259
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,909
for consistency if we're not getting the

260
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,319
same testing done on one end of the

261
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:06,659
country that we are at the other we're

262
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,420
gonna have a problem here so the

263
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:12,120
products that are coming online are at

264
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,039
new products right I mean the people

265
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,000
make gummies people make edible products

266
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,189
people make cookies what's new at least

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,200
in the regular dated framework is the is

268
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,300
that they now are gonna have THC CBD and

269
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,820
other cannabinoids in them and so neo I

270
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,589
think let's come to you and I'll ask you

271
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,540
you know these consumer packaged goods

272
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:35,160
these kinds of things that are already

273
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:38,639
being sold is their utility and having

274
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:41,519
that kind of deep CPG experience come

275
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,409
from other realms and come into the

276
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,340
cannabis industry and help build that

277
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:49,289
sort of safe trusted reliable model sure

278
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,019
yeah we certainly think so that's been a

279
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:54,120
big part of our strategy and let's say

280
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,740
looking at senior management how we've

281
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,230
added to the team aggressively in the

282
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,240
last 12 to 18 months as we built out

283
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,480
partnerships in the edible space like

284
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,000
bang and and like Ruby sugar so we've

285
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,259
drawn on we're in London Ontario which

286
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,399
is a terrific market with

287
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:13,590
history not only Agriculture but also

288
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,939
food manufacturing and processing as

289
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,560
well as manufacturing of all kinds of

290
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,050
other products so there's a terrific

291
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,359
labor force London it's not a huge city

292
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,979
but there's over half a million people

293
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,629
and I would say a disproportionate

294
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,759
amount of skilled labour relative to the

295
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:30,120
size of the city so absolutely we're

296
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:33,000
adding in that area intentionally our VP

297
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,490
of operations as 25 years of experience

298
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,379
working with companies like Clorox and

299
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,080
General Mills Maple Leaf Foods B and G

300
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,480
our director of ops was at Nestle for

301
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,070
well over a decade and we continue to

302
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560
draw people from other CPG companies

303
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,090
like Pepsi etc so that's a huge part of

304
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,500
addressing I think where purchase

305
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,720
brought up which is how do you create a

306
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,340
consistent quality product that you know

307
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,009
lives within the regs and doesn't test

308
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:00,269
negative for pesticides etc it's hugely

309
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:03,299
important circling back on safety and

310
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,100
this 10 milligram maximum THC per

311
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,729
package that's being implemented by

312
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,970
Health Canada Emma what do you think

313
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,430
that cap on the potency of your products

314
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,160
has in terms of defining who the

315
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:19,229
consumers are that will eventually

316
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,259
purchase those products at the point of

317
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,210
retail is it a different thing entirely

318
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,189
than for example in medical consumer

319
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,960
base and how are other jurisdictions

320
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,020
regulating in this area we heard from

321
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,490
Laurie Ajax earlier about California

322
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,860
what are we doing visa vie a market

323
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,720
that's about the same size as Canada 35

324
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,120
million or so people that's coming

325
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,029
online at about the same time as Canada

326
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,159
how do we stack up this is really a new

327
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,990
consumer category and I think anyone who

328
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,899
is an avid consumer in the audience

329
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,210
would testify to this that a 10

330
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,730
milligram limit may not be enough if you

331
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,470
are a high tolerance consumer so in

332
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,909
terms of your customer segmentation I

333
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,190
think for these infused products you

334
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:02,069
really are targeting the can a curious

335
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,630
the novice consumer means there's a lot

336
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,790
of due diligence in terms of pairing

337
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:08,070
education with your product concepts as

338
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:09,719
well I mean really advocating for safe

339
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,610
and responsible consumption if this is

340
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,470
going to be someone's first experience I

341
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,779
think also by nature of the product

342
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,180
format its non combustible it's not

343
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,620
smokeable so it's very approachable to a

344
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:22,859
wider segment of consumers so when we

345
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,480
compare this to looking down at the u.s.

346
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,029
marketplace in California specifically

347
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,670
there's a hundred milligram potency for

348
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:32,679
a beverage as an example as the upper

349
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:34,929
limit so the consumer that's drawn

350
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,299
towards that product is perhaps from the

351
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:40,179
legacy market or a higher tolerance

352
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:41,949
consumer there what's currently going

353
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,839
into the dispensaries demanding these

354
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,210
products and so the dispensaries in

355
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,889
California haven't been as open to

356
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,660
carrying a wide selection of the lower

357
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,789
potency drinks because they're thinking

358
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:54,009
the consumers not there yet but those

359
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,649
products at that type of potency are

360
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:58,480
really to draw in the new consumer so

361
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:01,029
it's the brand's responsibility to make

362
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,039
sure they're building awareness outside

363
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:04,990
of retail to drive that consumer

364
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,939
in-store to know that there's a product

365
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,039
format and a potency that's appropriate

366
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,840
for them so I think for Bev canna that's

367
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,849
really been the focus is looking at the

368
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,430
new consumer what are their aptitudes

369
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,470
and motivations and pairing products

370
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:19,449
that are ten milligrams and less so

371
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,519
starting at potentially a micro dose two

372
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,220
and a half milligrams in different

373
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,000
ranges and I think to you as a

374
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,340
manufacturer that's obviously an

375
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,470
advantage to get people to consume more

376
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,240
of your product so if you're creating

377
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,240
too high of a potency it doesn't really

378
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,159
leave a lot of room for multiple

379
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,529
consumption occasions potentially within

380
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,569
a day or potentially within any given

381
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,339
purchase so definitely I think this is a

382
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:46,960
new consumer category with that type of

383
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:51,639
potency limit to me the ten milligram

384
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:55,509
limit is like light beer yeah it's it's

385
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,159
going to me ensure the continuation of

386
00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:00,340
what I call the hundred dollars on the

387
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:03,129
barbecue I have a friend she's got

388
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:06,639
Crohn's disease and every Friday she and

389
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:09,009
her husband place $100 in an envelope

390
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,220
and put it on the barbecue they come

391
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:14,559
home that night $100 is gone and there's

392
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,360
a little bag there because it helps her

393
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,879
where the Crohn's disease that milligram

394
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,769
is not enough all this is going to do is

395
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,480
make a lot of fat people and so let it

396
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:23,829
hurt the consumer because imagine how

397
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,550
many brownies are going to have to have

398
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:29,770
to get the right THC level I think it's

399
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:32,259
something that have to revisit it

400
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:33,029
reminded me also years ago the BC

401
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,330
government brought

402
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:39,089
a minimum drink price for alcohol and

403
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,980
they got protests from the legions and

404
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,080
veterans clubs because they set the

405
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,080
drink price too high they didn't consult

406
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,550
but so they had to go back and lower it

407
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,710
to get it so that you when you went into

408
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:51,439
a lesion it was cheaper I think this is

409
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,759
one they have to go back and rethink

410
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,360
yeah I'd love to add a little anecdote

411
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,039
to that as well so for the past when we

412
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,050
first entered the market about four

413
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,370
years ago for anyone who doesn't know my

414
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:03,809
background my last company was called

415
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,399
baked edibles recently purchased by

416
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:08,069
fashion brands thank you very much you

417
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,659
guys are fantastic but when we first

418
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,760
entered the market it was all high-dose

419
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,439
stuff all of it and everyone was in the

420
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,639
market was an educated consumer they

421
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,140
knew exactly what they were looking for

422
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,480
they often knew a potency they were

423
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,279
looking for and the majority of the

424
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,070
products that we sold we sold over 50

425
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,750
SKUs were on the higher end of the range

426
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,160
at some point after about a year and a

427
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,330
half we started introducing low dose

428
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,919
products because there were new

429
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,990
consumers entering the market who wanted

430
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,599
these products ultimately in the first

431
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,060
year our it looked like this one giant

432
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,320
hump of high-dose products and this is

433
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,939
we're talking like two hundred and four

434
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,129
hundred milligram brownies as our number

435
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,840
one selling product soon after about a

436
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,850
year and a half and an ultimately over

437
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,190
the course of the next three years as we

438
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,230
added these lower dose products like a 5

439
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,310
milligram gummy I kid you not it is

440
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,960
literally the opposite end of the

441
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,609
spectrum that's where the other giant

442
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,009
hump of consumers started coming in the

443
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,139
the middle areas were or so so but

444
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,610
without a doubt the the potency at the

445
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,899
high end was huge and there's a huge

446
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,649
segment of customers who are gonna be

447
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,629
left behind

448
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,889
who are gonna remain in the legacy

449
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,059
market as long as they can because

450
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,590
that's where they'll find the products

451
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,940
until we see a solution that's

452
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,250
appropriate to transitioning them into

453
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,140
the legal market I think you know

454
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,430
Connect said one thing I think i perfe

455
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,320
say anything everything I'm about to say

456
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,060
by I think it makes sense to have two

457
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,859
tracks one for medical and one for rec

458
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,259
where a medical patient chord or a

459
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,209
higher dose product you know I've had

460
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,299
family members that were dosing with are

461
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,860
so fighting cancer we're taking hundreds

462
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,899
of milligrams a day so that that's a

463
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,209
totally different sport it's not the

464
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,340
same conversation and you're completely

465
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,420
brand and there was this barbell you

466
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,769
know we've got the really high dose

467
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,140
let's say folks that have built up a big

468
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,970
tolerance and you know 10 or 20

469
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,470
milligrams which by the way is still the

470
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,870
cheapest date in town for

471
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,210
a novice I mean if you spend ten bucks

472
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:49,908
and buy let's say two chocolates and

473
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,079
you've got a total of twenty milligrams

474
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:54,750
that's a that's a that's a lot for

475
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,349
someone that's new to trying edibles and

476
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,179
I think what we don't want is to create

477
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:01,558
really bad experiences for new users

478
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,538
you're going to get a lot of pushback

479
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,849
and it's going to go right up to the

480
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:08,009
government really quickly so we tried to

481
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:09,869
at least embrace I mean you'll you'll

482
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,028
beat your head in complaining about

483
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:13,138
government rules you know the other

484
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:14,759
thing I would say is we're still very

485
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:16,558
thankful that were the first g7

486
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,589
countries have legalized recreationally

487
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,928
and this is still version 1.0 I mean

488
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:24,709
there there's room let's say in time to

489
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:28,259
change and allow for higher higher doses

490
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:31,319
and I think they they did underscore in

491
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,870
the last panel and I I note it as well

492
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:36,240
in this Ajax's discussion earlier the

493
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:38,178
California has chosen to have separate

494
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,470
tracks for medical and non-medical

495
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:42,000
consumers the W's consumers versus

496
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,028
medical consumers and it seems to me

497
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,769
that our federal government here is in

498
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:48,898
some respects abdicated their

499
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:51,778
responsibility to medical consumers in

500
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:53,668
this legalization 2.0 that are rolling

501
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:55,409
out derivative products and you know

502
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:57,299
it's somewhat personal to me because I

503
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:59,519
spent a lot of time litigating how this

504
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:02,038
issue and and and the brave people that

505
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,679
came and testified in the Smith case and

506
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,240
mr. Smith himself you know we did a lot

507
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,370
of work to ensure that patients had

508
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,798
accessed the derivative products period

509
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:13,678
and and it feels like some of that is

510
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,960
being undone with these potency limits

511
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,600
even though myself as a 35 year cannabis

512
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,548
consumer I'm not taking a 400 milligram

513
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,579
brownie there's just no chance that

514
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:24,929
that's ever occurring I'm the low dose

515
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,418
consumer despite the fact that I have

516
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,500
high tolerance when I'm smoking cannabis

517
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:30,659
incorrect opiate drugs for different

518
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,819
smoke I agree with the 10 milligrams as

519
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:34,889
a dose I don't necessarily agree with it

520
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:36,750
being limited to one package it's a

521
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:39,959
hugely undue burden on industry under

522
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,730
young consumers on the environment I I

523
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,950
think we're all on the same page there

524
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,628
so we do have the rules no they have

525
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,808
been written there was opportunity for

526
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:49,949
public comment comments were given

527
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:52,740
somewhere he did some were not heeded

528
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,808
that that particular one I think was was

529
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,009
the decision when it was made to go

530
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:59,430
conservative early

531
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:01,500
versus versus more liberal early but now

532
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,690
we have a rollout you know we're we're

533
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,420
mid-september here October 17 is

534
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,880
legalization 2.0 in terms of these

535
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,779
products being theoretically able to

536
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,550
come online and I know it may not feel

537
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,869
like things are happening quickly to

538
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,000
people that have been in an industry

539
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:19,739
living and breathing this but when I

540
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,839
talk to bureaucrats they think things

541
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,000
are moving at the speed of light so this

542
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,589
is this is a you know a real difference

543
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,599
between people that are living and

544
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:29,639
breathing cannabis in the industry side

545
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,159
and people that write rules and change

546
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,880
legislation for a living

547
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,500
industries got to be nimble let's talk a

548
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,900
little bit about this rollout that's

549
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,450
coming in the next 90 days from both the

550
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,610
industry and consumer perspectives Emma

551
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,410
you know there's this thing that that

552
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:48,599
people talk about in industry it's the

553
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,840
first to market ideas like you get there

554
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,329
first you have an opportunity to

555
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:57,569
potentially gain early market share and

556
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:59,159
dominate the category how does the

557
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:02,579
regulatory scheme that's in place

558
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,170
currently pose challenges to processors

559
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:07,019
and manufacturers like faff ganna

560
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:09,870
looking to get that early mover

561
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:12,210
advantage I think if anyone's aware

562
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,399
there's a regulation that exists that

563
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,519
the facility must be fully built and

564
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,370
established before you are in in ability

565
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:23,099
to receive your license so this really

566
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:25,679
positions people that have existing

567
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:29,039
manufacturing expertise ahead of the

568
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,840
curve and the ability to scale up to

569
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,149
commercialization and optimize your

570
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,429
production practices to accommodate

571
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,440
things like childproof lids to

572
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,720
accommodate applying the excise stamp to

573
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,299
accommodate labeling lock code and

574
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,029
potency per batch along your production

575
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:47,369
line these aren't easy learning curves

576
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,990
to go through if you haven't worked on

577
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:52,139
an existing bottling plant or an

578
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,079
existing manufacturing line before so

579
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,670
while that is

580
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,619
hindrance maybe to new market entrance

581
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:00,960
it's an advantage to those that have an

582
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,239
existing expertise within manufacturing

583
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,870
so you'll see a lot of early market

584
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,150
entrants

585
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:08,159
and that have that expertise in the

586
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,840
background whether that's constellation

587
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,450
brands whether that's the most in cores

588
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,159
hexo collaboration or whether that's up

589
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,080
and comers like volcano that are making

590
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,529
use of an existing manufacturing

591
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,089
facility based in a soyuz actually but i

592
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,160
think there's a big learning curve to go

593
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,689
through and so that's been causing some

594
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,509
headaches obviously as we work through

595
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,840
implementing things like the childproof

596
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:33,210
lip the perk package stipulations but

597
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,039
then also getting your facility modified

598
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,620
in order to meet the security

599
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,049
requirements for your processing license

600
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,819
so that early mover advantage i think is

601
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:43,710
only an advantage if you have some an

602
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,720
existing asset or infrastructure that

603
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,490
you're taking advantage of and as many

604
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,470
of us probably know it won't be december

605
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,480
until the beginning products start to

606
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,819
appear in market but I think this is

607
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,190
really a 2020 rollout so that early

608
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:58,950
mover advantage could actually be q4 of

609
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:02,700
2020 so there's still a wide open market

610
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:05,308
to to seize here so let's let's tease

611
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,289
that out a little bit it seems to me

612
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:11,339
that you know when we saw the transition

613
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:14,480
from in the cultivation side for example

614
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:18,449
we saw a lot of existing greenhouses

615
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,360
convert from green pepper production for

616
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,710
example to cannabis production which

617
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,589
gets you a little bit of an advantage

618
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,569
versus building a purpose-built facility

619
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:29,009
that takes a substantial amount of time

620
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:31,319
to complete it seems to me that if

621
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:33,299
you've got you know a food manufacturing

622
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,279
plant and you're making brownies already

623
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:37,649
and they're moderately successful maybe

624
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,869
you just bring in the THC and CBD and

625
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,400
run a couple extra shifts and and infuse

626
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:42,479
your already existing products and your

627
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,100
existing plant

628
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,259
Branden is that uh is that a feasible

629
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:48,119
path to market I'd say it's a lot more

630
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,670
difficult in this industry than it is in

631
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,928
the traditional food manufacturing for

632
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,370
those of you who can probably imagine

633
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,900
what it what the life of an entrepreneur

634
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,250
would look like in traditional food

635
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,540
manufacturing you probably start with a

636
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,009
farm stand you know a couple of good

637
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:01,049
products out of your home kitchen you

638
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,609
saw locally you scale up you scale up

639
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,319
you scale up and suddenly you get there

640
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,959
in this industry good luck

641
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,158
you can't sell any of that you have

642
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,110
have a million dollars and get an LP

643
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,210
what that means is it's shutting out a

644
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:12,740
tremendous number of small players who

645
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,630
are would be producing these otherwise

646
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,669
incredible products and who could be

647
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,320
coming into this market and it's what

648
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:19,640
it's doing is leaving folks like us with

649
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,379
the burden of taking on all those

650
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,100
products so I think we're gonna see a

651
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,778
real dramatically slow inclusion of

652
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,339
different products as it comes along

653
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:30,259
there's a lot of companies who've really

654
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:32,148
hesitated to take that risk into edibles

655
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,408
right off the start a lot of companies

656
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:35,449
are starting with one or two products

657
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,860
but without a doubt selection and

658
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,750
product quality and everything else it

659
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:40,278
it'll improve slowly over time as

660
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,990
opposed to what it would have done had

661
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:44,869
we've been able to shape this in the way

662
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,149
that small entrepreneurs and small were

663
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:49,489
had more we're better facilitated and to

664
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:51,589
get coming in those small entrepreneurs

665
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,000
to I think are forced into a different

666
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:56,000
type of business equation because they

667
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,769
have to license or give up a little bit

668
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,079
of their intellectual property and their

669
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:01,398
equity in that idea to somebody who

670
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,439
would take their product to market under

671
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:06,168
their own license so yeah it creates a

672
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,580
lot of stifling I think for those

673
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,590
entrepreneurs that have the hustle and

674
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:11,480
heart and that deserve a go at this

675
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:12,829
there's no commissary kitchen model

676
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,740
right now it's frustrating these

677
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:17,298
products and and the reality is in

678
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,909
health Canada made a decision to not

679
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:21,440
allow colocation with food production so

680
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:23,659
if you have an existing food production

681
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,159
facility you think well you know I can

682
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,510
run my food production and then I can

683
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,490
bring in another shift and I can just

684
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:30,730
infuse these products with cannabis you

685
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,870
simply can't do that you can't with the

686
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,710
cannabis ingredients so as an example

687
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:38,479
the packaging or the bottles that Bev

688
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,788
canna uses are made on a different side

689
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,440
of the operation completely divided in

690
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:44,089
separated buildings but we can blow

691
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,548
plastic on one side of the operation

692
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:48,048
essentially it's a transaction sold into

693
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:50,450
the other side of the operation so there

694
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:51,740
are some ways to create efficiencies but

695
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,778
certainly not within any of your

696
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,700
ingredients or the production line

697
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:58,278
itself so it literally is duplicating

698
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,808
all of your your production I was

699
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,210
sitting in a meeting with the BC food

700
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,288
pros Association about a year ago at

701
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,640
this point when the regs were first

702
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:06,470
announced and they've been holding

703
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,360
meetings over the course the last two or

704
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,159
three years and kind of bringing in

705
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,209
people from food and starting to think

706
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,220
hey guys start thinking about the

707
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,870
edibles it's gonna happen and in a room

708
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,970
full of 60 people most of whom were

709
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:18,379
involved in the food industry alone like

710
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,740
it was maybe me and Zen abyss from the

711
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,840
cannabis

712
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,390
side and they announced the regulations

713
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,519
and the dispensed mayor pardon me the

714
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,110
despair in that room was just palpable

715
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,329
it was crazy to seeing how every single

716
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:30,859
company there was thinking great we get

717
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,539
to use this excess capacity that we've

718
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:34,459
already built out on our cookie line on

719
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:35,839
our brownie line on our snack bar line

720
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,190
and then suddenly it dreams were

721
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,409
shattered and they realized it was an

722
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,940
entirely new business that they would

723
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,440
have to build and partner with someone

724
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,920
who has experience from the industry if

725
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,720
just the burden became imaginably high

726
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,720
so there are there are sort of roll out

727
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,480
issues on the industry side but there's

728
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,120
you know a positive coming to it was

729
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,679
Brandon referenced earlier that there's

730
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,599
some data suggesting that there's up to

731
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,850
3 million new consumers that are waiting

732
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,919
to enter this space and become cannabis

733
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:05,659
consumers but that stay away from

734
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,529
consuming cannabis currently because

735
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,600
they don't want to smoke or babe Neil

736
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:13,940
what do you think this suggests both is

737
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,799
in terms of the need for education of

738
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,330
those new consumers but also the

739
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,220
cultural shifts that's happening when

740
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:23,000
millions of new people begin to consume

741
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,130
cannabinoids right what is hugely

742
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,839
important so we're very proactive about

743
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,940
publishing things on our website and

744
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:31,399
through social media doing people advice

745
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,830
about I don't know what start low and go

746
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,620
slow means we've sort of started saying

747
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:37,699
try some and then wait til tomorrow

748
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:40,039
there's no reason for anyone to have a

749
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,170
bad experience unless they have no

750
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:44,000
coaching on on how to go about trying

751
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,710
inaudible and that just relates I think

752
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,089
primarily to milligrams and what you're

753
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,100
dosing partly what you're eating as well

754
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:51,529
you know a chocolate like kicking a

755
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:53,178
little differently you know given the

756
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:54,859
the cocoa butter is a great conduit

757
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:57,860
versus let's say gel cap or another

758
00:27:54,859 --> 00:28:01,039
product so the education goes a long way

759
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:02,689
but what we've tried to do also in the

760
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,329
spirit of that education is not just

761
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,730
bring a marriage of say chocolate and

762
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:09,289
distillate that's nice but we partnered

763
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,240
with bang intentionally through our

764
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,649
joint venture in Canada where we the

765
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,390
exclusive right to produce and sell

766
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,250
those products across the country and

767
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,140
export from Canada because that's a

768
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,808
cannabis brand and so there's brand

769
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:24,200
value there important brand value but

770
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:25,490
all and trust but also this is not a

771
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,740
science experiment these products

772
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,759
already exist in the market in

773
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,779
California they've moved into Nevada now

774
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:36,059
in Florida so to us that's the essence

775
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,829
of global branding where someone can go

776
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,539
buy a bank chocolate let's say the honey

777
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:41,609
pot in Toronto or one of the

778
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,589
dispensaries in Vancouver and it it will

779
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:45,509
be the same chocolate in the same recipe

780
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,189
if you went to you know met men in

781
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:48,660
Venice Beach or something let's say or

782
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,610
in San Diego or San Francisco that

783
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,930
you'll find the same products might be a

784
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:53,429
little different dosing will absolutely

785
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,220
be different packaging

786
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,740
they'll be French on it in Canada for

787
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,390
starters but that's you know to us that

788
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,960
is a hugely important the same thing

789
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,340
with Ruby

790
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,079
you know the cannabis sugar installs

791
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:05,549
that they make are sold in Washington

792
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,559
State now it's a much younger company

793
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:09,059
than bang but interesting disruptive

794
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,250
product that our cannabis brands and

795
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,929
cannabis products to begin with I think

796
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,640
one of the most important pieces of

797
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,430
education to is actually the feedback

798
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,530
loop for the consumer so products that

799
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,210
are made with water-soluble technology

800
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:23,129
means that there's a quicker onset so

801
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,799
the consumers better able to regulate

802
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,630
their experience dose and outcomes based

803
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,669
on that quicker feedback loop than

804
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,500
something that's a fat based edible that

805
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,880
might be a homemade brownie where you

806
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,109
know we've all had those experiences in

807
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,730
the past where it's so variable

808
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:38,729
depending on your own endocannabinoids

809
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,200
system depending on the dose that you

810
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,789
ate depending on what part of the

811
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,960
brownie tray it was from so this

812
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:44,700
homogeneity

813
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,490
that's required as part of our

814
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,500
regulations requires a technology

815
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,120
advantage like a water soluble extract

816
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,980
so that gives you that quicker feedback

817
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,929
loop so the consumer has more

818
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,849
instantaneous awareness about what their

819
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,200
experience is about to be and will be

820
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:59,219
over the subsequent few hours so you may

821
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,019
not have to wait till the next morning

822
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,880
right you might have that feedback or

823
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:04,500
should have that feedback within let's

824
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,090
say less than 15 minutes is kind of the

825
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,049
the common standard with water soluble

826
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:11,849
extracts so Burt you know there's this

827
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:13,829
pent up demand we're hearing about for

828
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:17,129
these different varieties of products

829
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:19,409
and legalization 2.0 is scheduled to

830
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,840
come online October 17 these products

831
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,250
will be legal technically for commercial

832
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,439
sale at that point of course you can

833
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,539
make them at home currently now if you

834
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,890
want to but they'll be legal for sale on

835
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:31,500
October 17 does that mean we have

836
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,480
products on the shelves on October 18 or

837
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,940
is there some obstacles in the way to

838
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,799
actually seeing products and if so when

839
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,450
do you expect that to actually roll out

840
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,210
you can go to your store and buy a

841
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,249
cannabis infused chocolate

842
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:45,379
I think it'll go the same way as the

843
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:49,429
retail cannabis stores have gone the

844
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:53,569
slow rollout adding it on when we got

845
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:55,369
into licensing retail stores we were

846
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:59,329
surprised how long the application

847
00:30:55,368 --> 00:31:01,519
process takes we did last fall but a

848
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:04,668
year ago now we did an application for

849
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:08,450
one of our liquor clients for a liquor

850
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:10,759
store liquor hi sorry a pub up on Main

851
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,009
Street and this is an experienced

852
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:15,200
licensee and his application was about

853
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:18,139
half an inch 3/4 of an inch thick for a

854
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,389
liquor primary license during the same

855
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:22,428
time this gentleman decided to get into

856
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:24,678
the world of cannabis so we put in a

857
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:27,649
cannabis retail store application and it

858
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,450
was 15 inches high same person same

859
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:31,668
business but as 15 inches that

860
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,129
application took a long time to get to

861
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:35,929
the process and we've had people that we

862
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:37,878
were working with about a year ago who

863
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,889
are still waiting now somewhat is the

864
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:41,959
fault of the applicants but it's a very

865
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:44,689
slow process going through the

866
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,848
government what we're finding is that

867
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,830
there's not enough stores out there now

868
00:31:46,848 --> 00:31:50,388
to even serve the demand for cannabis

869
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:52,368
now a lot of people between the

870
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:55,069
provincial regulations and the municipal

871
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:56,928
x' municipalities are really delayed I

872
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:59,088
think with the coming out of edibles I

873
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:01,429
think will be a slow process to get them

874
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:03,588
into the stores and again what the

875
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:05,679
process right now is going to do is give

876
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,548
a huge advantage to the BC government

877
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,190
cannabis tours or the government

878
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:12,798
cannabis stores over the private stores

879
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,528
and I also of comes back to my supply

880
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,219
issue the second thing I think it'll do

881
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:21,259
is prop up the black market even further

882
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:23,629
it's such a disincentive to the consumer

883
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:25,729
because most people that we talked to

884
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:27,048
are really anxious to get into edibles

885
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:30,038
they don't want to vape they don't want

886
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:33,618
to smoke but they would consume inedible

887
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:35,088
and I think there's a huge demand for it

888
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,949
but I don't think that the pipeline's

889
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:39,888
gonna be full right at the beginning and

890
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:42,288
but yet I think it's fascinating I look

891
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:43,998
at what's going on in kettles similar to

892
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:45,588
what happened in craft beer and now

893
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:48,480
refreshment beverages and the liquor

894
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:50,609
stores we've got a plethora of

895
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,470
beverages and liquor stores with it and

896
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:54,509
you know Mike's Hard Lemonade came along

897
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,519
and then after that there's an explosion

898
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:58,109
of refreshment beverages I think the

899
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,400
same thing will happen with edibles I

900
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:03,389
think would be a really innovative

901
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:07,679
creative stuff that that innovation and

902
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:09,150
that creativity hopefully will translate

903
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,950
into a wide variety of products that

904
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:14,220
consumers appreciate and can come back

905
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,410
to but but you did mention Burt that

906
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,970
there's this sort of elephant in the

907
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,370
room which is the fact that these

908
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,829
products aren't really new they're all

909
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:27,599
for sale currently in Canada right now

910
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:29,730
in the legacy marketplace it's not easy

911
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,199
to market your products it's not easy to

912
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,058
brand your products when you do it

913
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,779
legally you've got sort of big stop

914
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:38,639
signs and small small brand elements you

915
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:42,599
go into your local liquor store and the

916
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,700
craft beer industry has a wide variety

917
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,439
of really interesting packaging options

918
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,529
available to them some that might even

919
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,929
be attractive to children you know

920
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:54,389
placed right at child level on the on

921
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,990
the stores on the shelves in the store

922
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,130
so I'm a with those tight restrictions

923
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:02,099
on branding and marketing what

924
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:04,440
opportunities are there for brands to

925
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,599
carve out consumer awareness so that

926
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,869
people come and say well actually that

927
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,878
products available at the at the legal

928
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:13,649
dispensary so I've been working in

929
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:14,878
product development for over a decade

930
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:17,519
now in the natural products industry

931
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,409
prior to working in cannabis and I'm

932
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,030
trained as a nutritionist as well so

933
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,070
this might be a little bit of a bias but

934
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,470
I think with as much restriction as

935
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,539
there is on packaging when a consumer

936
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:29,279
approaches the Shelf there's very

937
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:31,619
limited touch points for them to make

938
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,909
their product decision based off of so

939
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:35,039
one of the things I think is really

940
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,898
going to shine especially in the the

941
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,898
onset of this category perhaps before

942
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:42,480
regulations change is how clean are your

943
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:44,069
ingredients so if a consumer is able to

944
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,960
you know be appealed by maybe the color

945
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,519
of the package or that the method of

946
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,889
consumption itself they're interested in

947
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,570
beverages to pick up that package what

948
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,450
they're basing their decision off of is

949
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:56,550
potency for sure price of course but

950
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:58,259
then what's in that product so as

951
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,580
they're artificial colors is there

952
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,270
artificial sweeteners is there

953
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:02,889
sweeteners in general

954
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:05,139
so for Viviano we've been really looking

955
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:07,960
at clean ingredient label minimal

956
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:10,480
ingredients no added sugars no

957
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,880
artificial colors so nothing that would

958
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,980
cause for concern alarm everything

959
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,510
that's all-natural so I think that's a

960
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,219
huge opportunity for brands and

961
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,500
manufacturers is to formulate with a

962
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:22,000
higher quality standard so that there's

963
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,070
nothing offensive making somebody put

964
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,989
that product back on shelf and then

965
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,940
ultimately I think efficacy is a big

966
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:29,859
part of the marketing play if your

967
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,929
product delivers on the occasion that

968
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:35,320
you're seeking I'm so something that's a

969
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,639
little bit euphoric as an example or

970
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,559
something that helps you relax and

971
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,019
unwind at the end of the day these

972
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,759
occasion based types of outcomes I think

973
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:45,670
that's a big appeal in terms of somebody

974
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,260
reapeat purchasing or recommending that

975
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,360
product or referring that product to

976
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,010
others in their network so in some cases

977
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,140
this comes back to grassroots marketing

978
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:55,000
initiatives word-of-mouth and in other

979
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:56,859
cases it comes back to the fundamentals

980
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,210
of product development which is what you

981
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,220
what are your ingredients and what's

982
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,539
your quality standard when you're

983
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:03,039
formulating I think that's the huge

984
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,119
opportunity here especially at the

985
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,300
beginning of this category

986
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:09,010
I think another big key of consumer

987
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,230
repetition on branding is just that

988
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,940
repetition with so few touch points the

989
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,500
store is the place where they see your

990
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,820
brand first if you're not on the shelf

991
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,380
they will replace you with the product

992
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,269
next to you so I think in the early

993
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,950
rollouts we saw a lot of companies who

994
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:22,570
brought products to market early they

995
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:23,858
had that first mover advantage but they

996
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,840
couldn't hold it because their products

997
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:27,579
didn't remain on the shelf so I know

998
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,470
we're producing a like a high volume

999
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:30,880
strategy of always trying to be there no

1000
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:32,349
matter which brand we're producing for

1001
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,300
and I think it's really important that

1002
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:35,980
the consumer can go in see your product

1003
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,570
and buy it over and over and over and

1004
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,309
over if it's the only place they're ever

1005
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,320
gonna see your product I'm excited about

1006
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:42,969
outdoor grow coming online cuz I think

1007
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,160
that will help keep these products in

1008
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:46,750
supply because the input amount that

1009
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,920
you're using is so minimal if you're

1010
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,780
using you know refinement and

1011
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,700
purification and your extraction process

1012
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,560
but hopefully we won't see the same

1013
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:55,419
supply issues as these categories come

1014
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,340
online but I think that's a great point

1015
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,079
is the replicate ability of seeing these

1016
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,490
brands and the visibility in the market

1017
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,139
strongly agree with the green labeling

1018
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,059
as well we're going with natural fruit

1019
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:07,000
purees from Okanagan peaches and so

1020
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:08,590
forth so we've got just about two or

1021
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,480
three minutes left I did want to save a

1022
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,210
little bit of time for questions let's

1023
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,500
let's go to some questions I'd ask that

1024
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,420
you just

1025
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,670
ask the question ask it as succinctly as

1026
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,409
possible and then in the answers let's

1027
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,730
try to also be a succinct as possible

1028
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:23,170
get through as many as we can the next

1029
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,230
day those are nice words let's hear for

1030
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,970
the panel one more time gravity is the

1031
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,980
soul of wit we'll go here then we'll go

1032
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:34,989
there and that'll be it really it was

1033
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:38,110
really interesting so the very beginning

1034
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:40,569
of the panel you hit on on quality and

1035
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,099
testing of these products and to me this

1036
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,480
is a really interesting issue I thought

1037
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,759
it was really interesting that you can

1038
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,010
test stuff that's on the shelf and get

1039
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,020
you know very different answers as to

1040
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,210
what's in there so what do you think the

1041
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:53,889
solution to that problem is are we gonna

1042
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:57,250
go to some standardized or validate

1043
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:58,509
validated testing process for this I can

1044
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,920
jump in on there and yeah I think you

1045
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,170
have something to add as well too there

1046
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,079
is a variance that's actually allowed on

1047
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,670
the label so depending on the potency

1048
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:08,469
that you're claiming there's a different

1049
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:11,050
variance at different breaks along that

1050
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:12,879
potency spectrum so what this means is a

1051
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,769
manufacturer could produce the label in

1052
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,500
advance just for you know efficacy and

1053
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:19,449
efficiency in there costing strategy as

1054
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,579
long as their label is testing within

1055
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:23,259
that variant suspect they can release it

1056
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:24,880
into the market but I think the due

1057
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,790
diligence is for the manufacturer to

1058
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,250
label based on the batch so when you get

1059
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:31,599
your testing data back to label it not

1060
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,969
just according to the variance that's

1061
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,139
allowed but the actual values that were

1062
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:36,819
achieved for that batch and that

1063
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:37,900
transparency ultimately I think is going

1064
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,940
to shine through in the eyes at the

1065
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,289
consumer even if the retailer then has

1066
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,490
to do a little bit of explaining you

1067
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:44,349
know why is this batch a little bit

1068
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:46,659
different than the last batch but I

1069
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:48,639
think that's the ultimate implication

1070
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:50,980
for manufacturers and processors is to

1071
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,759
label on a per batch basis to overcome

1072
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,920
that variance

1073
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,750
yeah there's very little times when the

1074
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,579
customer a kid gets over the feeling of

1075
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,019
dishonesty and especially when you're

1076
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:00,429
paying who knows how many dollars per

1077
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:02,050
ten milligrams each

1078
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:04,239
every milligram that's not in there is

1079
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,440
someone is hitting someone's wallet but

1080
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,179
the other answer there of course is

1081
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,619
industry associations and coming from

1082
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:11,049
within industry to standardized testing

1083
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:12,190
across the provinces there's no push for

1084
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,630
it from government right now because

1085
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,519
they've already handed out these testing

1086
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,690
licenses to the labs and they assume

1087
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,789
that the labs are doing it at a high

1088
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,050
quality level and they may well be the

1089
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,579
difference is that they're not doing it

1090
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,560
standardized with standardized processes

1091
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:25,119
across the level we know a lab that was

1092
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:26,329
taking an entire brownie breaking off a

1093
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,789
corner of it blend

1094
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:29,929
that and getting a result that's not a

1095
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:32,150
homogeneous sample it's not a

1096
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:33,980
representative sample and so we were

1097
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,110
hoping that not all labs in Canada are

1098
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,980
doing that but at the same time we need

1099
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:42,289
everyone to be on the same page I want

1100
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,179
to say something I think that we in the

1101
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:47,659
industry and we come from all sides

1102
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:49,879
makers investors entrepreneurs I think

1103
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:52,789
we have a responsibility to find an

1104
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,190
international agency to develop testing

1105
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:57,529
standards I'm in many countries in my

1106
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,360
investments and I'm working on

1107
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,220
laboratories in some of the European

1108
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,230
ones and we don't have high enough

1109
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:05,480
testing standards and I think if we were

1110
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,210
the ones to propose them and maybe go to

1111
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,130
the United Nations to have them help us

1112
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,230
with these standards that could be

1113
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,630
accepted internationally I think we'd

1114
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,369
put ourselves in a much better place so

1115
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,690
that's my thinking I actually disagree

1116
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:19,009
with the we don't have high enough

1117
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,389
standards I just don't think that

1118
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,710
they're consistent enough I think in

1119
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:23,299
Canada with the highest standards in the

1120
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:40,340
world for testing especially on food

1121
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:43,310
products I think it i think that i think

1122
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:45,800
that's agreed we need to lead in this

1123
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:47,420
category it certainly speaks to the need

1124
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,390
for coming together and ushering in

1125
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,920
legalization 3.0 which hopefully will

1126
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:54,259
see the fall of the international drug

1127
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,599
control treaties and more coordinated

1128
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,410
effort across jurisdictions so thank you

1129
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,230
all for your attention

1130
00:40:57,409 --> 00:41:01,940
thanks to ICBC for having us and already

1131
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,500
you know guy thank you Kirk

1132
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,950
let's hear for Kirk and all the fabulous

1133
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,949
panelists that was great very

1134
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:08,949
informative
