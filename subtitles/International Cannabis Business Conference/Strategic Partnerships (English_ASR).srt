lindsay robinson i'm the executive

46
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,469
director of the california cannabis

47
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,989
Industry Association we are a trade

48
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,840
association based in California we have

49
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:03,179
almost 500 members representing over

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,478
10,000 employees across the state and

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,340
growing every every day every month we

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,400
have been around for just about six

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,469
years and our primary goal is to lobby

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,560
on behalf of the industry

55
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:19,050
to essentially help policy reform create

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,210
policy reform and regulatory reform that

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,280
allows your businesses to be treated

58
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,349
like any other business in the state and

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,719
as any of you know who are operating in

60
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,449
California and our members know this is

61
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,939
a very difficult challenging task

62
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:35,819
California's complicated and convoluted

63
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:37,560
and over-regulated and we're exhausted

64
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,949
and stressed out most of the time but

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,120
but optimistic still optimistic and one

66
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,389
of the reasons I was really excited

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,400
about being on this panel is because we

68
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:50,099
get to talk about a positive things

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,530
right strategic partnerships I think for

70
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,530
all of our different businesses really

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,289
enhance what we do and these

72
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,330
partnerships are our core many times to

73
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:03,179
how we to how we work and how we are

74
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,680
successful so we're gonna dive into it

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,080
today we're gonna leave some time at the

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,460
end for questions we're running a little

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,110
bit over but hopefully you all will

78
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,939
stick around with us and if you have

79
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,880
questions we're gonna have about 10 or

80
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,250
15 minutes at the end so again you know

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,560
as Debbie said with the last panel this

82
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,419
is a group of experts and we're really

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,949
excited to showcase some of their

84
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,708
expertise and knowledge but also I

85
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,810
encourage everyone to try and connect

86
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,360
with some of the panelists after and

87
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,000
especially at the party this evening so

88
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,100
exciting ok so one of the things I

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,259
really wanted to chat with each of you

90
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,989
about is to talk a little bit personally

91
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,729
about how you got into the industry and

92
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,430
sort of what your your inspirations are

93
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,819
so feel free to take a few moments Jamie

94
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,040
and and tell us tell us a little story I

95
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:53,969
got into the industry about five years

96
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,039
ago which is which is interesting

97
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,109
because my father was a clandestine

98
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,879
grower my whole life so technically I

99
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,890
was in the industry whether I liked it

100
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,629
or not because I had to know when to

101
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,518
bring my friends home you when it

102
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,379
smelled like skunk in the garage and

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,170
when I couldn't and I found that

104
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,930
annoying growing up was a college

105
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:16,229
athlete did not smoke marijuana was anti

106
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,019
marijuana and then I'm also the cousin

107
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,700
of the DJ in Cypress Hill who lit a

108
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,459
joint on Saturday Night Live when I was

109
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,949
in college and so had the poster child

110
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:28,339
of marijuana

111
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:31,038
that I grew up with about five years ago

112
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:33,888
I got sick I smoked marijuana at the

113
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:36,589
behest of my nephew it it fixed me

114
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,658
instantly and from that day forward I

115
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:39,829
was no longer anti marijuana and mugs

116
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:42,259
and I were investing in real estate

117
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,810
together for about 15 years and he had

118
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,550
me review one of the first contracts

119
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,639
that they were asked to look at and

120
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,889
coming into the marijuana space and then

121
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,538
I told him I wouldn't sign it and I told

122
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:57,199
him why I won't mention who the company

123
00:04:53,538 --> 00:05:00,228
was that was trying to get Cyprus to be

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,689
their spokesperson and one thing led to

125
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:04,968
another and he asked me to represent the

126
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:08,659
band and I started off in the industry

127
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:10,759
as the marijuana manager or agent for

128
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,778
Cypress Hill and through that

129
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,090
partnership

130
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:17,598
I found bang and one thing led to

131
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:20,959
another and now I'm the CLO everything's

132
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:22,038
possible great thank you for sharing

133
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,329
that shemitah

134
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:28,188
I love cannabis and so throughout my

135
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:30,139
corporate career actually a little bit

136
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:32,360
earlier than that throughout my college

137
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,228
in the in corporate career I was always

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,979
just a closet consumer I grew up in the

139
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:42,378
corporate supply chain and transitioned

140
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:45,560
my IT consulting business to serve the

141
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,479
cannabis space so lending my background

142
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,778
in project management international

143
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:53,810
marketing and operations management to

144
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:56,389
the industry was my goal I wanted to see

145
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,310
this industry look like every other

146
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,528
industry that I worked in from a

147
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,680
professional and standards point of view

148
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:05,449
and so I saw the opportunity about five

149
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,569
years ago when Maryland legalized

150
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,699
medical marijuana and have been on a

151
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:14,658
journey from Maryland to Pennsylvania

152
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:19,400
and now out to Oakland since great thank

153
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:21,949
you Kevin so on a personal note I've

154
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,609
been involved in the industry for 25

155
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:27,819
years professionally in the last four it

156
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,288
kind of started when San Jose

157
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,790
consolidated the industry and only

158
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:35,139
allowed for 16 operators

159
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,520
one of those operators happen to be

160
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,889
really good friends with the managing

161
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:41,620
partner of our firm and so we just kind

162
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,360
of by dumb luck fell into that working

163
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,430
with that client and it was wonderful

164
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,939
because I had such passion for the

165
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,709
industry to get that experience to learn

166
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:54,129
with them and to kind of tackle it from

167
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:56,680
a professional perspective in doing so

168
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:59,759
we saw that there was an incredible need

169
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,900
to help these businesses really flourish

170
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,449
they don't really have the

171
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:08,769
infrastructure dialed in at first and so

172
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:11,229
we really kind of spun off our business

173
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:12,579
a keen to kind of address a lot of the

174
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,569
needs that we saw within that industry

175
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:18,159
in terms of navigating compliance

176
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:21,310
documenting internal controls policies

177
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,650
and procedures helping them develop all

178
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,660
that framework to capture accurate

179
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:28,179
information to make decisions to help

180
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,830
get financing so it's just been

181
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,629
incredible how this just kind of came

182
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:34,329
about to us and just really helped us

183
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:37,060
build the expertise and really get

184
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:40,629
involved into this industry that's great

185
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,670
thank you and so I think many of us have

186
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,889
a personal connection and personal story

187
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,600
about why we work in this industry right

188
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,129
how many of you have have something that

189
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,530
touches you personally about cannabis

190
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,019
right how many people do you think that

191
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:56,769
work in say real estate or the alcohol

192
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:58,750
industry are super expired by by that

193
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:01,240
industry I think that that's part of the

194
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,610
uniqueness of folks who work in the in

195
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,990
the cannabis space and something that

196
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,840
hopefully where we're utilizing as a

197
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,540
strength in order to inspire our

198
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,909
businesses inspire each other and build

199
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,710
strong partnerships around that so I I

200
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,680
would love to hear some of your stories

201
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,579
afterwards I have been working on policy

202
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,370
reform in the cannabis space for

203
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:27,430
probably how almost 15 years first as an

204
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,459
advocate and cultivator and then more

205
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,769
formally in working on with a number of

206
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,569
nonprofits so I spent almost a decade

207
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:38,199
with the Marijuana Policy Project which

208
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,550
works on national issues federal issues

209
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,320
but as well as state medical adult use

210
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:46,250
legalization through ballot initiatives

211
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,110
and the legislature so

212
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,250
that is that's my background and now I

213
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,360
get the the privilege to work with CCI a

214
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,190
and and one of the things that I think

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,899
is so extraordinary about the

216
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,050
opportunities that that I've had and

217
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:03,289
that I've worked for is the partnerships

218
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:05,179
that we've been able to create so first

219
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:07,250
with CCI a and then also with the

220
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,799
Marijuana Policy Project because really

221
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,809
nothing happens in a vacuum so I'd

222
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,299
really love us to we're gonna dig in a

223
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:15,889
little bit you know first I'd like folks

224
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,179
to kind of talk a little bit about the

225
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,250
current business that you're in and

226
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:22,339
really kind of dive deep in terms of the

227
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,899
the business model and then to think a

228
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,509
little bit about what some of those

229
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,519
strategic partnerships are because they

230
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:30,350
can take many different forms so I want

231
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,059
us to to really dig in because I think

232
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,440
we each have a unique perspective on

233
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,629
that so she need a why don't why don't

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,540
we start with you this time so when my

235
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:41,419
consulting practice strategic

236
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:44,419
partnerships are critical to achieving

237
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:48,199
our clients goals if we're applying for

238
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:50,509
a license it's necessary for us to form

239
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,790
partnerships with the community to gain

240
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:55,580
their acceptance for us even operating

241
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:58,099
in that space we have to work with the

242
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,520
state to of course submit an application

243
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,860
that is merit-based and competitive

244
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,199
enough to win a license and so it's not

245
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,720
something that I can do alone as a

246
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,820
one-woman show and so strategic

247
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,889
partnerships are critical for that work

248
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:17,360
in terms of my entrepreneurial endeavors

249
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:21,439
strategic partnerships have allowed me

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,690
to actually own a piece of the

251
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,810
businesses that I'm working in as a

252
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,910
consultant it's one thing to be paid for

253
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,500
your services but then you walk away

254
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,419
from you know something that's going to

255
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,350
grow up to hopefully be you know really

256
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:40,569
big and so I've been able to go from

257
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:44,779
just consulting for a fee to actually

258
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,160
exchanging my talents and skills for

259
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,929
equity and it's something that I

260
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,329
couldn't do because I couldn't

261
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:52,759
necessarily write a $500,000 check or

262
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,280
you know say I'm going to fund this

263
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,230
million-dollar project but with the help

264
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,199
of good folks that bring you know other

265
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,789
resources to the table not only fine

266
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,320
but also their background perspectives

267
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:08,299
experiences in other industries and so I

268
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,129
think that's been something that I've

269
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,769
leveraged to not only grow my consulting

270
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:15,580
business but then also the project that

271
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,569
I'm partnering on yeah that's great I

272
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,889
have a couple thoughts on that that I'd

273
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,390
like to circle back to and a little bit

274
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:24,830
but Jeanne wood what about you

275
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:27,139
well bangs made our company based on

276
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,680
strategic partnerships we exploded onto

277
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:33,470
the scene in California in 2010 we've

278
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:36,679
got a nine year history of award-winning

279
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,649
cannabis edibles and CBD products we

280
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:45,679
were bringing CBD packaged goods into

281
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:47,929
California since 2011 so wins when our

282
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,989
CEO Scott really saw the opportunity to

283
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:52,819
expand the brand nationally there was a

284
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,039
barrier to entry in most of the legal

285
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,860
states because it would take a million

286
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,689
dollars to get a license you know in

287
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,600
let's say one state but you do that

288
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,520
times 50 conceivably you can see that

289
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,560
it's impossible to spread your brand if

290
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,860
you are in control so you had to find

291
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,619
operators in those states that had the

292
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,740
wherewithal to get the license be good

293
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,799
operators and had an interest in taking

294
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,629
the brand into that state so finding a

295
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,029
strategic partnership just to expand the

296
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,000
brand was one thing but where we're at

297
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:29,149
now that were so far down that path is

298
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,950
we what we say is we used to you had to

299
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,799
take what you can get and now you get to

300
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,629
get what you want in our partnerships

301
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,509
because the industries come so far along

302
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:41,269
now we are partnered with people like in

303
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:44,059
Deva in in Canada which is a publicly

304
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:46,549
traded company our licensee in

305
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:48,409
California is Origen house formerly can

306
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:52,250
a royalty which is a publicly traded

307
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:55,939
company our licensee in Florida is true

308
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,559
leaf they they manage about 75 or I

309
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,190
should say have a stranglehold of about

310
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,869
75 percent of that market those are

311
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,000
companies that came to us and said we

312
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,659
want to represent and partner with your

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,490
brand so we were able to build a brand

314
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:12,469
footprint with our strategic

315
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,539
partnerships that have allowed us to

316
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,730
grow our brand

317
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:19,698
across the nation and now we're now

318
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:25,430
being distributed in Germany leishan

319
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:27,139
Stein Austria Poland Canada and we're

320
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,239
expanding into some other countries

321
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,310
right now it's really exciting and we're

322
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,680
gonna go public in about three weeks we

323
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:36,319
could not have done that had we tried to

324
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,299
control everything on our own bangs

325
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:44,240
really a testament to strategic

326
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:45,259
partnerships so strategic partnerships

327
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,399
to me

328
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:51,679
I just really honor the business owners

329
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,500
and entrepreneurs that really built the

330
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,419
industry that we have today there's

331
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,698
people that have been in this space when

332
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,169
it was you know you couldn't really talk

333
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:02,149
about it and there are operators and

334
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:04,129
they've been pushing the envelope and so

335
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,899
I just have tremendous gratitude for

336
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:08,889
those individuals because we're all here

337
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:12,620
because of that the associations as well

338
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:14,899
they put money towards lobbying so again

339
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,789
we're all sitting here today because of

340
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,769
the efforts of those that built this

341
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:21,469
industry and those that are supporting

342
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,379
and moving this industry forward on a

343
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,750
personal note I was diagnosed 18 months

344
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,389
ago with MS and it's because of their

345
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,009
efforts that I have access to CBD and

346
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,959
products which helped me deal with my

347
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:36,828
chronic back pain that's happened as a

348
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,359
result of my diagnosis so just

349
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:41,719
tremendous gratitude and I want to thank

350
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,600
you know the association's and those

351
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,730
that have built this industry and now we

352
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,159
kind of I look at it like we have an

353
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,528
opportunity to kind of pay it forward

354
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,389
and so that's what you know our business

355
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:57,889
kind of spun off to kind of help

356
00:14:53,389 --> 00:15:02,169
businesses thrive so compliance as

357
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:04,579
Lindsey had brought up is is is it's so

358
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,349
from so many different angles there's a

359
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:09,698
lot of red tape in which operators have

360
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:13,069
to navigate so we kind of help them

361
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:15,078
follow have documented processes in

362
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:17,120
place in an effort to kind of address

363
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:20,778
the compliance issues that they have to

364
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,948
help them with financial policies and

365
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:23,958
procedures to ensure that they're

366
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:26,708
capturing accurate information so they

367
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,049
can make business decisions to grow so

368
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:31,149
the partnerships are incredible and

369
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:34,058
there's many partnerships we get through

370
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:36,249
being part of these events one thing I

371
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,618
like to be for my client is as a

372
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:41,499
consultant I don't know everything so I

373
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:43,360
have to leverage the other service

374
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:46,659
providers and professionals that I meet

375
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,459
at events like this so it really takes a

376
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:52,028
village to kind of help our clients

377
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:54,669
really grow their business and so I kind

378
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:57,039
of love meeting everyone within the

379
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:59,198
different aspects of servicing this

380
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,519
industry so that we can kind of you know

381
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,919
if a client says they have a certain

382
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,769
need I can find a person to kind of help

383
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,088
fill that need for them yeah that's

384
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:09,009
great I'd love to think a little bit

385
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,009
about strategic partnerships in terms of

386
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:14,769
what chanita was mentioning earlier

387
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:18,220
either investing or equity shares of a

388
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:20,379
company and how folks can can grow those

389
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,990
you know those relationships and and and

390
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,610
find strategic partnerships that work

391
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,399
for them and their business do you have

392
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,619
any insight absolutely I mean in

393
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,499
addition to the business side of things

394
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:35,740
I think about the work that we're doing

395
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:38,319
with the MC ba to support and strengthen

396
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,058
the social equity programs and economic

397
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,240
development in every community and

398
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:45,370
strategic partnerships are really

399
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,470
critical for that we've seen great

400
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,720
examples in other industries of

401
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,899
companies stepping up and developing

402
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,379
small business and entrepreneurs and it

403
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,089
lends itself to innovation you know and

404
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:01,209
and really growing and strengthening

405
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:03,730
those companies one of the examples I

406
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:07,000
love to reference is Unilever's

407
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,058
acquisition of the sundial brands this

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,880
is a an immigrant into the United States

409
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:14,379
who was basically making soap in his

410
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,770
kitchen and he was using his mother's

411
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,140
recipe Unilever with all of their

412
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:22,269
infrastructure and institutional

413
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,278
knowledge and access to money could not

414
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:28,720
lock down the very lucrative black

415
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:31,359
business black health and beauty

416
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,069
business and so even when black women

417
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,709
couldn't find these products in

418
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:37,839
traditional outlets and big box stores

419
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,450
like Target and Walmart they would

420
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,189
purchase online and so sundial

421
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,779
I mean they were killing it and so

422
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:49,900
Unilever acquired this company

423
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:53,049
significant acquisition but in addition

424
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,759
to that they he demanded a strategic

425
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,009
partnership that would support

426
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,930
development and and support

427
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:01,420
entrepreneurs especially women of color

428
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,670
and so they contributed 50 million

429
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,610
dollars to the New Voices fund and the

430
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,950
New Voices fund develops other minority

431
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:11,409
entrepreneurs especially women and so I

432
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,269
think it's important as I am going out

433
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,980
whether it's consulting and helping

434
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:17,170
other folks build their businesses or

435
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,269
the strategic partnerships that I'm

436
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:22,840
forming or the work that I'm doing with

437
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:28,329
the MC ba to look at industry and and

438
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:31,599
help share that story as a real example

439
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:33,730
of how the industry can get behind the

440
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,369
initiatives that we are fighting for you

441
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:39,160
know we put policies in place to ensure

442
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:41,469
access to this industry to ensure that

443
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,019
there's a place for folks that haven't

444
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,329
been impacted by the war on drugs but

445
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:50,259
we're not putting any money behind them

446
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:52,539
and if one of the you know most

447
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:54,730
significant barriers to entry is access

448
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:57,759
to capital we have to start there and

449
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:01,000
the industry itself will be more

450
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,059
valuable and more prosperous through

451
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,160
strategic partnerships that support

452
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:08,799
sustainable endeavors diversity and

453
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,320
inclusion initiatives and equity in this

454
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,180
space okay yes thank you for those

455
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,460
points I would love to talk a little bit

456
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,440
more about the associations so I'd love

457
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,970
for you to expand on the MC ba in just a

458
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,330
little bit but I wanted to get Jamie's

459
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,900
perspective on on working with investors

460
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:27,339
you know or our partners in in a

461
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,480
significant way that would make them a

462
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:32,769
strategic partner do you have any

463
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,870
insight to share on that I have a lot of

464
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:37,240
insight to share on that that's been

465
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:38,649
happening with bang for the last few

466
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,130
years we've got some of our investors

467
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:46,050
sitting in the audience that we met at

468
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:48,340
this very event in Kauai last year

469
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:50,470
through them they've introduced us to

470
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:51,879
other people that we've connected with

471
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,950
and I do feel like when there's

472
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,570
synergies or when you can compliment

473
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,680
each

474
00:19:54,569 --> 00:20:01,019
there's needs everybody wins and I think

475
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,440
that's one of the things that bang looks

476
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:07,769
for in a strategic partnership is if you

477
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,049
have a need that we can fill and we have

478
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:11,639
a need that you can fill you know that's

479
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:14,069
obviously where a partnership starts

480
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,920
from but then you also have to like each

481
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:18,419
other at a at a basic level you have to

482
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,170
know that everybody's gonna get along

483
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:25,529
and play well in the sandbox and you

484
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,029
know I think to chanita spoink if you're

485
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,829
going to make a strategic partnership

486
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:31,859
and if you're out looking for a partner

487
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:35,189
it's you have to be looking for ways to

488
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:38,129
actually include the people that don't

489
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,769
get or don't have a voice or don't get

490
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,510
to play in the sandbox and I'm one of

491
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:45,629
the things I'm proud of with bang is

492
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,700
we're out there looking for exactly that

493
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,520
so we've we've made some strategic

494
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,319
partnerships that are you know like Kim

495
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,379
Rivers in true leave is a woman owned

496
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:58,829
business women represent a larger

497
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,930
percentage of ownership and executive

498
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:03,689
positions in cannabis it's still not

499
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,100
representative of you know population

500
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,410
we're not there yet

501
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:10,289
I think of Ruth Bader Ginsburg saying

502
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,900
she'll be happy when there's all women

503
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,490
on the Supreme Court and people say what

504
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,250
she says well we don't question when it

505
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,049
was all men right you know we're looking

506
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,119
for inclusion and we're getting it in

507
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,930
this industry but but bangs out there

508
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,889
looking for it

509
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,970
so out of our entire executive team

510
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,130
everybody's a woman we have women of

511
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,730
color except for two we have two men on

512
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,470
our team I'm really proud of that so

513
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,440
we're out there looking for ways that we

514
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:41,039
can act actively find people that are

515
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,630
doing good things you know sustainable

516
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:49,319
packaging and just you know helping the

517
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:51,570
environment helping you know people that

518
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,000
don't have a voice and I think that's

519
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:55,379
I'm really pretty like proud to be

520
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,650
sitting here with you because I love

521
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:03,390
that you said that Kevin would you like

522
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:06,509
to add to that yeah so Capital is a huge

523
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,400
thing in this industry it takes a lot of

524
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:11,190
money to set up as

525
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,890
successful business and so one thing we

526
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,830
like to do is to be a strategic partner

527
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,540
for our clients you know one thing I

528
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:20,939
like to always say is I want to be the

529
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:23,879
wheel and I like to leverage other

530
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,620
service providers to be spokes again I

531
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,180
don't know all the answers but I want to

532
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:30,779
be able to help my clients to really

533
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,970
grow to the next level to obtain capital

534
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:35,430
you have to be a strong business not in

535
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,069
just what your product is but you have

536
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,019
to have strong financials you have to

537
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,179
have reliable financials so you have to

538
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:44,309
have audits so you know those are things

539
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,160
that we kind of offer to our clients as

540
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:50,129
well as helping them with the internal

541
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,130
controls and processes to be able to

542
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,960
properly navigate and capture accurate

543
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,380
information to address compliance

544
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,870
regulatory requirements you know even

545
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,590
filling out a proper tax return 280e is

546
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:08,459
a killer in this industry and so how do

547
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:11,519
we properly navigate that and so really

548
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:15,090
I look at strategic partnerships is

549
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:18,269
absolutely crucial in all levels for all

550
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:22,289
of us to help businesses get stronger

551
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:25,410
and grow to connect the investors with

552
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:27,480
the businesses so they can grow and so

553
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:30,060
really we like to work together with our

554
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,529
clients to kind of help them obtain that

555
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:34,980
capital so they can really move to the

556
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:37,559
next level so yeah I would like to

557
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,500
circle back to associations I know that

558
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:42,629
she need to talked a little bit about

559
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,279
MCB a-and and as you all know I work

560
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,610
with the California cannabis Industry

561
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:51,599
Association and we're a traditional 501

562
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:53,789
C 6 so we're a lobbying group and I

563
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,369
think about strategic partnerships a

564
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:57,839
little bit differently because we we

565
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,639
have partnerships obviously with our

566
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,500
members right we represent them and we

567
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,410
work with them and and to be honest

568
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,079
that's where all of the expertise and

569
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,940
the policy you know platform and

570
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,069
legislative priorities that all comes

571
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,590
from our members so I really like to

572
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:15,599
think of our members or clients you know

573
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:17,459
as our strategic partners because

574
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,679
there's there's that give-and-take of

575
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,990
information and sharing and and I I

576
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,799
would I know so much more about how

577
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,329
their business is

578
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,180
function and the issues that they're

579
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:28,799
facing because of their ability to share

580
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,500
that with me which is great but I also

581
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,930
think about strategic partnerships with

582
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,079
the legislature and with the regulators

583
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:40,110
and the amount of time that we have put

584
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,899
into building relationships with those

585
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:46,319
entities and how sometimes they go

586
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,300
sideways and they're they're not as as

587
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,220
strong as we would want them to be or

588
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:52,740
they don't hear the real concerns of the

589
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,500
industry but then other times we're

590
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,140
incredibly proud of those you know those

591
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,579
relationships because there's a real

592
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,380
give-and-take there in terms of us

593
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:03,299
sharing the expertise from the industry

594
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,220
with them and so we see great

595
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,599
opportunity with that you know when

596
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,850
we're working with a legislature that

597
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,699
comes to us and says hey I'd really like

598
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:13,889
to have a bill that regulates cannabis

599
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,220
in this way and we say hey have you ever

600
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:19,890
gone to a cultivation site and seen

601
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,509
cannabis growing do you do you know how

602
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,370
its harvested do you know how its

603
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:25,920
processed you know what extraction looks

604
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:27,779
like and when honestly four or five

605
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,240
years ago most of the legislators that

606
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:32,190
wanted to be a part of the conversation

607
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,109
and have bills with their names attached

608
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,610
to it and and be you know part of

609
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:39,389
regulating they did not have that

610
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:41,039
experience so that that piece of it I've

611
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,509
been really grateful that we've been

612
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,700
able to build those relationships and

613
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:47,039
share the expertise from people who are

614
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,009
actually working in the industry to

615
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,019
build what I consider to be strategic

616
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:54,480
partnerships and you know sometimes like

617
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:56,369
I said they go wrong we have legislators

618
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,529
that introduce bills and language that

619
00:25:56,369 --> 00:26:01,529
we are absolutely not supportive of and

620
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:03,180
that they're going to create more you

621
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:05,160
know regulatory headaches for the

622
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,840
industry right the goal is is that we

623
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,000
would like to be treated like any other

624
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,079
industry right and not regulated to

625
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,759
death

626
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,069
California is dealing with some real

627
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,470
growing pains right now in this regard

628
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:18,149
but I think it's important to think

629
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,309
about partnerships in many different

630
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,660
ways so I know we've had some

631
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:23,909
partnerships that have kind of gone I

632
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,640
won't say sideways but have caused real

633
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,860
consternation and we've had to fight to

634
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,140
remedy them and so I would love for any

635
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:33,000
perspective that you have on a strategic

636
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,800
partnership that maybe was fruitful at

637
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,029
one point but has gone a little bit

638
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,079
sideways

639
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:40,190
and then we can talk a little bit more

640
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:44,329
about associations well I'll tell you

641
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,950
things happen so quickly and you have to

642
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:51,000
foresee and plan for you know a number

643
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:54,779
of scenarios and so for the MC ba we

644
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,279
just really don't have time to expend a

645
00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:00,059
lot of energy around things that aren't

646
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:01,649
working so we're we're very quick to say

647
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:05,509
hey this isn't working let's go in a

648
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:08,310
different direction and it's been really

649
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:10,619
rewarding for these strategic

650
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:13,019
partnerships to result in things like

651
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:14,729
our model legislation and so for the

652
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,339
last three years we've brought together

653
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,759
you know a group of folks 30 to 40

654
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:23,669
individuals that represent industry

655
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:26,309
policymakers regulators activists

656
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,740
medical professionals and we've spent

657
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:32,460
you know two days together saying what

658
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,769
would an ideal adult use bill look like

659
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,960
what does a municipal ordinance look

660
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:41,099
like what is an a municipal ordinance

661
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,769
look like that will ensure equity and

662
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,019
access and diverse business types and

663
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:48,900
things of that nature tax us a tax

664
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:51,480
structure that lends itself to real

665
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,390
community reinvestment as opposed to

666
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,480
collecting taxes into a general fund and

667
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,970
then spending them on you know big

668
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,759
industry development projects as opposed

669
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,870
to education or healthcare or or any of

670
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,180
the other things that are needed in

671
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:08,579
these communities and so the strategic

672
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:11,220
partnerships that we have and just great

673
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:15,929
relationships that we have with folks

674
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:19,319
like DPA SSDP MPP it's been helpful to

675
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,700
us in our cause our company partnerships

676
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,609
have allowed us to do a lot of

677
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,910
programming around education provide

678
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:28,619
resources to folks Marley natural and

679
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,269
privateer was a great relationship that

680
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:34,589
allowed us to go and do expungement

681
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:37,529
fairs in Seattle and Portland we we had

682
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:39,599
an opportunity summit last year that was

683
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:42,019
a direct result of a strategic

684
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,789
partnership with Hoban law group and

685
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:46,950
University of Denver we are really

686
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:49,269
excited to continue our partnership with

687
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,819
state associations like CCI

688
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:55,299
and really excited about some upcoming

689
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:58,659
work with new organizations like CTF and

690
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:00,759
so we're going to continue to work with

691
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,820
folks that are interested in pushing

692
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,769
forth the the general agenda but that

693
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:08,139
are also concerned with making sure that

694
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:11,170
no one's left behind ensuring that folks

695
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,880
that look like me that have been caught

696
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,980
up in the criminal justice system just

697
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,200
don't have a million dollars to bankroll

698
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,240
this amazing idea that they're

699
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,830
represented that they have connectivity

700
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,720
to the larger and-and-and you know more

701
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:28,779
prevalent operators that are you know

702
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,509
multi-state and even international and

703
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,549
so again strategic partnerships with our

704
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:36,670
individual members our company members

705
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:38,559
and then other associations are how we

706
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,920
get our work done yeah

707
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,539
Jamie we go into every strategic

708
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,890
partnership hoping it's going to go well

709
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:49,299
I would say we've had some that have

710
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,860
gone really really well and we've had

711
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:53,259
some that have not gone really really

712
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:55,979
well and some of the ones that I look

713
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:59,019
back on and they haven't been successful

714
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,120
they started off you know with the right

715
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:02,980
intentions and I think what's important

716
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,079
when you when you enter that partnership

717
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,029
I always say write your divorce before

718
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,889
you get married because when you're in

719
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:11,200
the beginning of that process and you're

720
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,850
getting ready to join forces everybody's

721
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,380
in the ether of the excitement of the

722
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:17,559
deal well that's when it's really easy

723
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,150
to actually sit with them and say well

724
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:22,179
okay let's talk about all the ways this

725
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:25,210
can go wrong and get it on paper and be

726
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,549
ready to know what its gonna look like

727
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,470
if you have to part ways because the

728
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:31,899
reality of being in business in the

729
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,000
cannabis industry it's complicated it

730
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,650
changes all the time people have

731
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,170
different expectations in their heads

732
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:41,440
when they join into partnerships so as

733
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,470
things change and evolve it's easier now

734
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,470
and we've learned the hard way you got

735
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,269
to be able to cut loose quick if things

736
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,160
aren't going well so it's sort of like

737
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:53,200
beasts you know be slow to hire and

738
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,029
quick to fire what we're trying to do

739
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,539
now is really write our partnerships in

740
00:30:55,029 --> 00:31:01,119
a way where they're not as painful to to

741
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,889
you know separate from if they don't

742
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,399
work because the reality is

743
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,049
they don't always work we've been lucky

744
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,460
because the ones that we've done we've

745
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:11,139
learned a lot been doing this for nine

746
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,029
years and we've been doing it majority

747
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,429
the majority of our efforts have been in

748
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:17,500
partnership situations because we have

749
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:18,910
all of that experience in there we've

750
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,569
been really lucky because we've honed

751
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:25,900
the ability to figure out also how to

752
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:28,089
ask good questions of ourselves because

753
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,130
if I know what I really am looking for

754
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:32,859
if I know what I really do need and I

755
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,540
know where my pain points are I can ask

756
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:36,369
the right questions to make sure that

757
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:37,539
we're actually we don't just like each

758
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,949
other and want to do business together

759
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:41,109
but we're actually going to be

760
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,179
benefiting one another and there's going

761
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:46,509
to be a result for me and a result for

762
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:49,059
you that we're both expecting so you

763
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:50,589
know I would say in all of those the

764
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:52,480
ones that don't work are painful and

765
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,619
some more painful than others and I'm

766
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,919
sure you all know what I mean by that

767
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:59,558
but the ones that have been successful

768
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:01,330
make it worth it so I would I would say

769
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:04,178
even though we've had some some

770
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:06,490
partnerships go south strategic

771
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:09,250
partnerships that win-win when it does

772
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:14,289
work it's a beautiful thing that's great

773
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:16,240
thank you so I don't really have many

774
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:18,548
strategic partnerships that have gone

775
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,929
bad but there is you know I want to

776
00:32:18,548 --> 00:32:23,470
bring up again you know working with

777
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:26,200
clients you know things will be going

778
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,548
really well they're really liking

779
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,798
everything you're bringing to the table

780
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:32,918
the value re adding and then we get to

781
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:35,950
the topic of 280e and then I look like a

782
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,679
bad guy it's very hard for us as

783
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,240
accountants to help clients properly

784
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,320
navigate that because they don't like to

785
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,150
hear what 280 really is nobody nobody

786
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:50,649
does and it's hard cuz they all look at

787
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:52,509
me like I wrote the code and and and

788
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:55,509
it's just like no my job is to make sure

789
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:58,329
you stay in your lanes okay

790
00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:00,700
I disagree with the rule I know a lot of

791
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:03,159
my clients use that almost as their

792
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,259
strategy for how they make business

793
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,779
decisions and I try to change their

794
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:10,210
perspective just like look let's focus

795
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:12,970
on what it is we're doing and how we can

796
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,170
grow our top-line and manage costs but

797
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,539
don't have a tax law

798
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,640
DR what you're gonna do not everything

799
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:22,599
is cost of goods sold because you're a

800
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,950
cultivator it just isn't the way it is

801
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:28,639
so I have to be the bearer of bad news a

802
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:30,380
lot and and that's kind of hard to kind

803
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,230
of bring that to the table but again I

804
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,360
just try to tell them that look this is

805
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,620
about really building an empire in this

806
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,059
space and what you need to do is follow

807
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:42,679
compliance and the regulations and

808
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:45,220
that's why I say this is a very

809
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,019
expensive industry to kind of get into

810
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,329
and you just got to hold it out until

811
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:53,269
that is lifted and eventually it will be

812
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,919
lifted I don't know when but I do know

813
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:57,440
that as long as you can kind of

814
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,750
successfully navigate that and just

815
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,250
withhold that's when you're gonna be

816
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,400
sitting pretty you don't want to go

817
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:06,230
under over aggressively bypassing any of

818
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,850
the rules and right now the rules are

819
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,610
strict and I would just recommend

820
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:12,500
everyone do your best to follow the

821
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,780
rules because that's going to keep you

822
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,030
open we all know there's going to be an

823
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,220
inevitable consolidation within this

824
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,010
industry and it's those that are really

825
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:23,509
following compliance and doing things as

826
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,120
red as they can within the states in

827
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:30,860
which they're operating that will be the

828
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:32,480
last one standing great well I know we

829
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,329
do want to move into some questions so

830
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,789
I'm gonna ask each of the panelists to

831
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:40,039
share something that they're that

832
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:41,719
they're really particularly proud of and

833
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:44,239
it can be based around a strategic

834
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,128
partnership or an accomplishment but I'd

835
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,928
love to hear a little bit about

836
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:49,909
something that you're particularly proud

837
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:53,510
of and I'm gonna start with you Kevin so

838
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,610
I'm just proud to do my part for this

839
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,640
industry to thrive I'm very passionate

840
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:02,059
about the cannabis industry I'm excited

841
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,670
to see where it goes and so I just love

842
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:06,199
that I'm doing my part and it's great

843
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,380
when you know I work with the client and

844
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,629
we're doing things and and really help

845
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,430
them dial in some framework that they're

846
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,930
seeing the value and the other day I

847
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:17,419
just had a comment we wouldn't be where

848
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:18,589
we're at today without you and those are

849
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,320
the things that just make me feel

850
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:24,079
incredibly proud and this is just an

851
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,660
industry Bayt built by incredible people

852
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,429
and I'm just thrilled to be part of it

853
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:30,199
it's incredible who would have thought

854
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:32,899
that today we'd be where we're at I

855
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:34,909
would have never guessed and it's really

856
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,190
because of associations and

857
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:40,759
entrepreneurs and business owners that

858
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:43,358
have paved the way so thank you I like

859
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,819
that that's great

860
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:49,278
today I am most proud of a strategic

861
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:51,048
partnership that was born out of a

862
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:52,699
relationship that I formed in the

863
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:55,429
advocacy space

864
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:58,399
amber center of super nova women who was

865
00:35:55,429 --> 00:36:01,548
based here in Oakland and I have spent

866
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,170
the last few years bouncing ideas off

867
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:05,449
each other from the east coast to the

868
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:08,470
west coast around what social equity and

869
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:11,838
economic empowerment truly looks like

870
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:15,709
last year we came together and we now

871
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:18,828
have a license for a non storefront

872
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:22,608
retail delivery business here in Oakland

873
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:25,490
or in Oakland and we are also incubating

874
00:36:22,608 --> 00:36:28,219
a social equity delivery licensing and

875
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:31,578
so you know we didn't have a big budget

876
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:33,500
backing us but we realized that as we

877
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:36,349
built our business that we could help

878
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,289
another business another person who

879
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:42,440
needs not just a check but actual

880
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,720
support in navigating this industry all

881
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,000
of the hurdles that are you know come in

882
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:50,139
the way of just starting up operations

883
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,210
but also making sure that our voices are

884
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:54,980
continuously heard at the city level to

885
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,260
ensure that this program is further

886
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,119
developed you know it's not enough to

887
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,760
just say hey we're giving you a thousand

888
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,010
square feet and so that is incubation of

889
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,510
a business it's not you know you need

890
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,339
real support you need access to capital

891
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,990
and you need folks that are committed to

892
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:12,048
developing and seeing these businesses

893
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:14,778
thrive so today I'd say that's my the

894
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:17,829
proudest the strategic partnership that

895
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:21,650
I'm good that I can think of right now

896
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:24,019
Jamie for me it's definitely the deep

897
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,099
friendships that I've developed over the

898
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:27,798
five years that I've been in the

899
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:30,430
industry you know coming from real

900
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:32,900
estate where it's really a dog-eat-dog

901
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:34,278
situation we're all fighting for the

902
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,450
same houses we're all fighting for the

903
00:37:34,278 --> 00:37:40,730
same deals I found that the cannabis

904
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:42,719
industry you know not to get all kumbaya

905
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:45,780
but the reality is

906
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,339
I come to this I come to the ICBC and I

907
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,960
run into people that I haven't seen for

908
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,380
a while and it's like running into an

909
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,119
old friend and and now I realize they

910
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,340
have really become my friends the people

911
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,429
that I'm doing business with we are so

912
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,960
like-minded that that's what I'm proud

913
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:02,849
of is being able to build the

914
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,320
relationships that I've been able to

915
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:06,750
build in such a short amount of time

916
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,760
that are really really deep friendships

917
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,309
that I know will continue if I jump out

918
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,070
of the industry or not that's what I'm

919
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:15,960
proud of that's great well whether we

920
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,330
like it or not we're all part of this

921
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,990
movement right this this greater entity

922
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:23,159
that is slowly but surely changing the

923
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:25,529
world and I think it's extraordinary

924
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:28,259
that we get to think about business and

925
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,840
regulation and partnerships while also

926
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,150
always thinking about social justice and

927
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,880
and really continuing on the legacy of

928
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:37,650
folks who who have been fighting for a

929
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,190
really long time to finally end

930
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:42,450
prohibition and we're getting so close

931
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,750
you know I mean I look back at January

932
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:47,669
first in 2018 and I cried really hard

933
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,019
that day and then I was like oh wait

934
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,450
California's a mess

935
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:53,099
but it's still you know like that that

936
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:54,809
is still the motivator I think for so

937
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,480
many of us and I hope that we never lose

938
00:38:54,809 --> 00:39:00,059
that I know that we're gonna maybe move

939
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,909
further away but I hope we can keep that

940
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,889
core and keep that that excitement and

941
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:06,569
that trust with our strategic

942
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:08,219
partnerships because really when we're

943
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:11,280
able to leverage those partnerships to

944
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:13,349
elevate our association or our business

945
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,730
or our brand let's hope that we're also

946
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:16,739
elevating the folks that we're working

947
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:19,590
with us that's where I think we have the

948
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:21,719
most growth potential and the ability to

949
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:26,309
change the world so let's keep that in

950
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:28,649
mind we are at close to end if there are

951
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:30,329
questions let's hear it one more time

952
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:34,050
for the panel though lives each Anita

953
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:35,269
Janie Kevin it's fantastic I just popped

954
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,620
up out of nowhere

955
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:39,780
you're good at that we have time for a

956
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:42,500
couple of questions for sure anyone

957
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,500
anyone
