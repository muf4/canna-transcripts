you

23
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,559
today what a momentous occasion and you

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,559
know what what's sticking with me is

25
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,079
that

26
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,599
approval rates I've read were 45% in

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:09,920
this country 45% approval ratings for

28
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,599
legalization you did this in the US we

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,118
have 90% of the people who support

30
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,039
legalization and I can tell you at the

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,400
federal level it's going

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,159
nowhere the other thing I'm excited

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,359
about uh I'm Japanese by background born

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,479
in Japan raised in the US our system our

35
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:32,478
legal system in Japan very much rooted

36
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,840
in what Germany has done so my personal

37
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,920
hope here is that my home country can

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,880
take what you've done and replicate that

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,519
better versions yes but this is the

40
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:47,359
first seed this is how it

41
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,959
grows so I'm I'm really excited about

42
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,159
the advocacy and the partnership that's

43
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:56,319
come to fruition to achieve reform it

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,719
takes so much time and dedication and

45
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:03,559
many of you are in this room gorg Alex

46
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,280
so many others who've made it happen and

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,159
I wish you a heartfelt congratulations

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,000
and massive gratitude for that

49
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,039
achievement that personal advocacy the

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,159
years of dedication you've pushed this

51
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,159
industry that we care so much about

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,720
forward but soak it in today cuz our

53
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,359
work is nowhere near done that work

54
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,400
includes transitioning consumers to

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,560
Legal

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,480
channels creating sensible

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,719
regulation solving the complexities of

58
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:41,518
injustices that have long served and

59
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,239
really undoing years of negative deeply

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,640
rooted

61
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,959
stigma and that work that work has to be

62
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,759
grounded in education education about

63
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,598
cannabis that's derived from science

64
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,439
research and

65
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:00,000
data so of course at the center of this

66
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,919
learning is a plant a plant that that's

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,919
been in use for over 10,000 years

68
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,158
traveling the world following our

69
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,719
patterns of human migration being put to

70
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:14,000
countless historic and current

71
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,318
uses thousands of years later since

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,519
2010 Leaf Le has focused on connecting

73
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:23,039
people with the long history of this

74
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,879
plant how it's been used and how it can

75
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,560
be used to enhance lives and leveraging

76
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,438
what we've learned about this plan and

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,799
continue to learn to share knowledge and

78
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,840
build community through our online

79
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,280
website and mobile

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,640
apps in our second decade now we now

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,039
welcome over 70 million visitors a year

82
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,238
who come to Leaf Le to research and

83
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,318
learn about cannabis and in North

84
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,360
America to purchase and order products

85
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:56,238
from thousands of licensed Brands and

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,079
retailers so that role we play as a

87
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,799
convenor an indirect Market participant

88
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,719
across three dozen US states in

89
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,719
Canada has given us a front row seat to

90
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:12,239
watch legalization and regulation unfold

91
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:15,359
to observe how people search buy and

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,199
consume cannabis and to witness how

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,519
thousands of businesses of all sizes

94
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,199
seek to sell it and from that front row

95
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,759
seat we have some observations we've

96
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,720
seen Market launches go well and some

97
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,199
not so

98
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,120
well and sharing leafly's direct

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,280
experience working in this unique

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,160
industry it's our hope that you all in

101
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,519
this room can take the lessons we've

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,840
learned to win legalization in Germany

103
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,959
and

104
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,959
Beyond so what does winning look like

105
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,439
each country and Market will have to

106
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:53,239
Define that for themselves but that

107
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,879
Journey wherever its destination it

108
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,960
starts with breaking down barriers like

109
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,560
stigma and negative stereotypes that

110
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,680
impair our Collective ability to allow

111
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,959
cannabis to be a meaningful active Force

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,800
for good good for individuals and good

113
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:14,198
for local communities around the

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,319
globe so the journey to normalize and

115
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,639
destigmatize starts with solving what I

116
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,519
call cannabis

117
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:26,079
illiteracy and tackling and solving that

118
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,359
illiteracy starts with opening

119
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,279
Minds we are all in the business of

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,800
Chang changing minds and changing Minds

121
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:38,519
begins with stories stories about humans

122
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,199
history with this plant reconnecting

123
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,918
people with the knowledge that our

124
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,520
ancestors for Millennia have used every

125
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:48,839
part of its plant its seeds its fibers

126
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,240
its extracts for utilitarian medical and

127
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,799
spiritual

128
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,240
practices and that's only within the

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
last 100 years that humans have spread

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,160
the seeds of prohibition driven by a

131
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,400
group of powerful American men

132
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,800
who waged a campaign against the plant

133
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:09,879
their actions weren't rooted in science

134
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,160
or data but in racial discrimination and

135
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,199
misinformation so couple that history

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,560
with stories of broadly inclusive

137
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,038
stories of communities and cultures that

138
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,079
have leveraged the gifts of the plant

139
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,199
whether it was the member Physicians of

140
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,560
the American Medical Association who

141
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,120
came out in opposition of

142
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,079
prohibition or old Japanese family

143
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,959
recipes that call for use of hemp seeds

144
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,639
in a traditional pepper mix or the local

145
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,359
communities in the US who are

146
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,079
experiencing job growth because of the

147
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,919
Cannabis industry or how those same

148
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:46,918
communities are reinvesting cannabis tax

149
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,719
revenues in local schools and nature

150
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,680
conservation we find that surfacing

151
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,639
these kinds of stories of cannabis's

152
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,639
everyday uses and benefits helps to

153
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,120
wedge that door open it enables greater

154
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,759
learning and further

155
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,199
understanding of this plant and its many

156
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,840
magical

157
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,038
properties this is the path to

158
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,318
destigmatization the opening of eyes and

159
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:15,159
Minds to the possibility that our

160
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,120
ancestors just may be knew what was up

161
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,759
with Canabis and that the relief and

162
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,959
efficacy that they experienced thousands

163
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,400
of years ago can now be backed up with

164
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,079
science and

165
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,038
data so keep telling your stories that

166
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,878
normaliz ize use and combat cannabis

167
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,560
illiteracy keep talking about the relief

168
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,000
that so many find for cancer treatment

169
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,720
pain management epilepsy and PTSD keep

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,680
sharing new stories that change the

171
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,159
narrative like Alex said how cannabis is

172
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,759
a multi-functional plant that can be

173
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:55,079
foundational to creating a green

174
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,000
economy because when a society is

175
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,560
broadly educated people are able to make

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,680
informed decisions and become better

177
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,158
participants in cannabis

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,240
society and we should be looking to our

179
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,560
governments and Regulators to join the

180
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,759
education journey and to incorporate

181
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,199
that knowledge into their

182
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,879
decisionmaking to help their citizens

183
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,919
overcome cannabis literacy and invest in

184
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,879
and share in science-led research that

185
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,839
expands Beyond campaigns that perpetuate

186
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,680
stigma and harm

187
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,158
hypotheses research about harm reduction

188
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,959
it's important but it's equally

189
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,799
important to fund research and studies

190
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,359
that can explain why so many people

191
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:44,399
consuming cannabis experience positive

192
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,759
outcomes we can't unlock the magic of

193
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,559
cannabis without varied

194
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,559
perspectives so think about this we're

195
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,679
raising the Next Generation in a post

196
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,439
prohibition Society they are way more

197
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:02,159
open and disposed to the plant to

198
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,839
parents know enough to guide their kids

199
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,000
through the decision of whether and when

200
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,680
to

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,039
consume what about the middle-aged like

202
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,759
myself people who are looking for

203
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,399
alternatives to alcohol or prescription

204
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:18,319
drugs to treat pain or for help with

205
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,159
sleep and then the Boomers who are

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,320
surprisingly way more open and welcoming

207
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:28,519
of this plan than my generation seems to

208
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,720
be all of these discussions require

209
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,360
Baseline know knowledge in the plant how

210
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,079
to consume it its different form factors

211
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,240
and different strains and equally

212
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:42,958
important when not to consume

213
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,839
it people need to know that everyone

214
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,000
experiences the effects of cannabis in

215
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,079
unique and different

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,919
ways and many of you in this room know

217
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:56,399
all of this but there are hundreds of

218
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,278
millions of people outside of this room

219
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,480
who

220
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:03,039
don't so that's our collect Mission

221
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,039
solving cannabis illiteracy with data

222
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:09,278
and information changing hearts and

223
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,399
minds and that's what paves a path to

224
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,879
Global

225
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,839
legalization that's a long that's a lot

226
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:19,799
of ground to cover an education is a

227
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:24,079
long game but trust that cannabis

228
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:26,919
literacy will come if we stay committed

229
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:32,039
and refuse to let negative stereotypes

230
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,039
stigma and misinformation impede its

231
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,919
progress what won't come nearly what

232
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:41,319
won't come nearly as slowly I hope is

233
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:45,479
building sufficiently robust developed

234
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,360
channels for procuring legal licensed

235
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,560
cannabis what we've consistently seen at

236
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,560
Leafly is that the more legal regulated

237
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,879
access points for cannabis the less

238
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:59,638
elicit sales in fact through re research

239
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:03,078
that we did last year we found that

240
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,480
local Municipal banss on legal stores

241
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:09,278
effectively creates an economic

242
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,039
protection zone for elicit sellers it's

243
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,958
really hard to keep consumers safe in

244
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,078
that

245
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,559
environment no one wins neither the

246
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:22,000
consumers the citizens The Regulators or

247
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:24,719
the nor the licensed

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,799
operators just as I said when I started

249
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,959
I'm really excited by German Germany's

250
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,838
move here the right to grow this plant

251
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,359
at home because gardening is not a crime

252
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,560
and to procure it through the Social

253
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,200
Clubs but we need to ask are these

254
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,958
channels broad enough to allow those who

255
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,480
are seeking access to the plant the

256
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:48,679
ability to get

257
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,720
it a Canadian Provincial leader once

258
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,559
said to

259
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:57,480
me it makes no sense to legalize

260
00:11:53,559 --> 00:12:00,479
cannabis only to regulate it back into

261
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,480
prohibition

262
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,599
prices and taxes are also a key part of

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,399
that access priced are taxed too high

264
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,680
consumers flee back to the illicit

265
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,919
market and there's more research to be

266
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,919
done but in the US we found that at

267
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,078
north of 33% in a price disparity

268
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,639
consumers shift back to Legacy spending

269
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:24,000
patterns and governments and

270
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,720
municipalities must resist the

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,120
temptation to tax or regulate operators

272
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,120
out of existence

273
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:40,000
we have seen over the last 24 months in

274
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:42,278
the US markets an an unimaginable number

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,879
of lenses lose their license due to

276
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,958
taxes and or the high high cost of

277
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:51,000
compliance and

278
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:54,399
Regulation and operators remember this

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,078
this is a crop prices will remain high

280
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,519
while Supply remains constrained but

281
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:03,519
when the wholesale prices of the CR drop

282
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,799
fall so will your revenues so build your

283
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,278
businesses understanding the eventual

284
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:12,519
economics of supply and

285
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,759
demand so my final lesson to share and

286
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,519
really this is really a wish list if I

287
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,439
could turn back the clock and redo what

288
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,399
we've done in North America so

289
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,279
far the the these would be the

290
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,240
prescriptions deal proactively with the

291
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:30,039
criminal justice implications of

292
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,278
Prohibition in the US many states have

293
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,159
committed to the automatic expungement

294
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:38,198
that's the um eradication the deletion

295
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,078
of criminal conviction records but some

296
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:41,879
in my like my home state of Washington

297
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,799
we were one of the first states to

298
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,679
legalize cannabis for recreational use

299
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,759
we have an expungement bill but it's not

300
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,958
automatic and what that means is each

301
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,480
individual must go and seek that

302
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,159
expungement on their own we have a

303
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,000
highly burdensome court and

304
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:58,719
administrative system so that is

305
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,519
practically impossible for people to

306
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,278
navigate

307
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,759
expungements shouldn't be the criminal

308
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,320
justice pieces should not be an

309
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,440
afterthought cuz if you've been arrested

310
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,320
or convicted for something that's no

311
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,600
longer a crime you shouldn't be treated

312
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,600
like a

313
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,838
criminal I understand that you there are

314
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,560
advocates in this room who support the

315
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,480
removal of cannabis offenses and my hope

316
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,638
is that you learn from our shortcomings

317
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,879
on this front address these convictions

318
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,079
proactively invite these individuals

319
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,360
back into society and back into this

320
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,638
industry where they can contribute in

321
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,959
valuable knowledge on how to cultivate

322
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,720
and distribute this

323
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:43,838
plant so the era of wielding cannabis as

324
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,320
a weapon or tool to destroy individual

325
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,320
lives that time has passed now is the

326
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,399
time to allow for healing and Justice

327
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,600
and let cannabis do what it has done for

328
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:00,059
thousands of years and that is to help

329
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,920
humans heal and build community

330
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,119
[Applause]

331
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,120
[Music]

332
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,719
it's a profound privilege and a

333
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,239
responsibility to be a part of the

334
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,000
legalization

335
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,120
story but to serve the magic the full

336
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,519
magic of this plan halfway done is not

337
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,000
an

338
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,039
option legalization is but a stop on the

339
