[Applause]

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,719
and then let's get started right away

71
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:03,719
Kai let's start with you maybe it's the

72
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,219
most pressing question is happening at

73
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,500
the moment what is happening in Germany

74
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,479
so would you give us a late a latest

75
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,759
update on the legalization efforts in

76
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,378
Germany where do we stand right now and

77
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,539
what is to be expected over the next

78
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,539
couple of months for sure

79
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:21,900
so as you all know we had Federal

80
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,120
elections in September 21 in Germany and

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,280
we had a new government a traffic light

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,739
Coalition Social Democratic party the

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,818
liberal party and the greens and they

84
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:36,019
agreed in November 21 on legalization of

85
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:38,839
a cannabis so the the plan is to

86
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,519
distribute cannabis

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,158
licensed cannabis and licensed stores to

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,500
adults

89
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:49,139
since now with one and a half years ago

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,019
there nothing really much happened

91
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:55,679
but now the decisive month will be the

92
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,780
March 2023 so we're expecting the draft

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,060
of the new government of the government

94
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,939
in March presented by the Ministry of

95
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,340
Health probably at the end of March

96
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,500
maybe there will be a leak like last

97
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,979
time with this Keystone with this key

98
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:15,120
Point paper and then

99
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:17,459
we see also we will also see the plan of

100
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,939
the German government how to roll out

101
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,600
these draft and how this can work we

102
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:28,139
have lots of international legal issues

103
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,560
starting with a single convention to EU

104
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,418
law and

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,639
mainly the last one and a half years we

106
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:38,099
spent discussions on how to how to

107
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,800
tackle this how to handle this and

108
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:46,500
that's the reason why it was so slowly

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:50,220
but now we're expecting that we will see

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,180
two different kind of of drafts so the

111
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,160
the first step of legalization will be

112
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,720
decolonization homegrown and Collective

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,900
home growth

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,940
um and the plan is to

115
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:05,459
get this draft at the end of March to

116
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,579
transfer to brunestar then it comes to

117
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,959
Brunswick within the normal procedures

118
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:12,719
the first hearing second hearing third

119
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,638
hearing and then it will be agreed on

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,180
before the summer break of of the

121
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,180
bundestag in June July so that's the

122
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,560
plan if that happens

123
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,478
decriminalization and town grow will be

124
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,879
allowed with immediate effect from June

125
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,038
or July this year on the complicated

126
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,779
thing is the commercial route to

127
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,659
establish a commercial route which is

128
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,779
the declared goal of the government

129
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:39,900
which means that you have cultivation

130
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,859
license cultivation license shops and

131
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,319
yeah

132
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,660
real business like we see in Canada and

133
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:50,459
in in the US

134
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,240
and that's tricky because there are lots

135
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:57,478
of illegal issues going along with that

136
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,699
because Imports big question right now

137
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,800
the German government assumes that now

138
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,900
Imports are possible to Germany so every

139
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,020
single gram has to be cultivated in

140
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,060
Germany because the EU has the only

141
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,659
authority to agree on international

142
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,959
trade agreements uh and if we can't find

143
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,020
a way to to deal with that we can't even

144
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:22,439
have a trade within the EU right now

145
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,120
because of these EU framework decisions

146
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:28,978
um but they're working behind the scenes

147
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:32,038
so almost every many EU member states

148
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:34,318
like Czech Republic Spain Portugal and

149
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,300
Malta Luxembourg Netherlands Germany

150
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,740
they all want to go a different route in

151
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,960
terms of cannabis policy and they're

152
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,660
working behind the scenes and there's an

153
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,399
initiative to change these uh these EU

154
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,319
framework decisions and to amend the

155
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:53,339
Schengen uh so that at least the EU

156
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:56,280
member states can can trade cannabis

157
00:06:53,339 --> 00:07:00,119
among them if they want to and they can

158
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:04,019
legalize cannabis on a certain

159
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,639
legal basis and not being afraid of the

160
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,839
you commission to start infringement

161
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:12,720
procedure procedures or stuff like that

162
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:16,560
so that will also be explained by the

163
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,259
health Ministry uh however you confirm

164
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,620
are you complying legalization can be

165
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,419
rolled out in Germany in March and we're

166
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,000
expecting a federal Supreme Court

167
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:29,899
decision also in March

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,500
before the Easter break on the general

169
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:36,179
legality of the Cannabis prohibition if

170
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,759
the Cannabis prohibition is legal and

171
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,280
complying with the constitution on the

172
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,340
grounds of the freedom of person I think

173
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,459
the two of our Constitution and article

174
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:50,818
3 the principle of equality equality why

175
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:53,939
is cannabis treating more treated more

176
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,560
strictly more stricter than alcohol and

177
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:59,759
these are the big developments in

178
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,579
Germany in March 2023 will be decisive

179
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,740
thank you um okay maybe we'll stay with

180
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,240
you you just said that there's a lot of

181
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,800
like contracts that have to be

182
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,180
considered in that regard in Germany

183
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,220
we're also talking about the

184
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,840
interpretation declaration or the

185
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,280
interpretation solution can you maybe

186
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,598
tell the audience a little bit about

187
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,679
that

188
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:22,319
yeah sure so there is the 1961 single

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,079
convention on aquatic Dux saying that

190
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,419
the trade of cannabis is only allowed

191
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,399
for scientific and medical purposes

192
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:31,439
and this is an international treaty

193
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,299
almost every country in the world is a

194
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,759
member of this treaty

195
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:39,319
um and so we have to deal somehow with

196
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:42,299
that Germany is in principle very

197
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,500
friendly to international law Germany

198
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,819
wants to comply with these rules and

199
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,440
there are different routes you can go

200
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,740
like Uruguay that takes a Firm Stance on

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,180
human rights

202
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,419
legalizing a cannabis allowing trade

203
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:02,879
with cannabis is on the grounds of Human

204
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:05,939
Rights because they had lots of crimes

205
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:09,480
and and victims and people suffering

206
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,700
from the ban of prohibition Canada did

207
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,820
sort of something else something nothing

208
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,160
you know don't know the mixture of Human

209
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,620
Rights and health protection and the

210
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,838
German government is now saying we

211
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,539
interpretate we inter we do an

212
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,839
interpretation of these single

213
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:29,939
convention and we say to legalize is

214
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,399
better health protection than to

215
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,360
prohibit to go on to prohibit cannabis

216
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,940
and that's how we interpret it and this

217
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,980
is in line with the singular convention

218
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,839
because the single function was made up

219
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,300
for the health protection for the

220
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,399
protection of your of the of the people

221
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:50,159
that's basically it there are so many

222
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,778
legal problems everything is disputed if

223
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,360
there is an Intercity possible

224
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:57,980
retroactivity

225
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,539
etc etc you can't find your way out

226
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,879
with a single convention and you can

227
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,939
just take a Firm Stance on human rights

228
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,700
like Uruguay or on health protection and

229
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,320
it's in the the singular convention will

230
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,860
never be changed in the in the near

231
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,320
future so think of States like Russia or

232
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:20,459
or China putting CBD in Hong Kong on the

233
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,399
list of prohibited substances so that's

234
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:25,799
the way but we of the the more delicate

235
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,740
issues of course the EU the framework

236
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:32,838
decision to find the solution to allow

237
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:36,360
International Trade within the EU to

238
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,880
find the ways that every EU member State

239
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,220
can legalize on firm legally grounds

240
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,379
yeah

241
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,720
so let's stay with the single convention

242
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,539
for a bit America has been one of the

243
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,879
main driving forces uh to bring this

244
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:52,919
contractual framework into place does

245
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,559
the single convention play a role at all

246
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,958
in the U.S and is the U.S maybe also in

247
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,939
the Second Step considering to

248
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,578
um legalize cannabis also on a national

249
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,800
level or is it going to stay Fair um is

250
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,019
it going to stay on the state level I

251
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,078
would say probably no to both I don't

252
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,879
think that the US is really concerned

253
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,759
about the single conventions treaty in

254
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,159
terms of domestic policy or with respect

255
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,379
to like violating international law if

256
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,699
domestic laws were to change it's just

257
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,100
not I don't think a part of the

258
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,440
considerations or the conversation or

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,540
the political dialogue yet it is ironic

260
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,920
obviously that the U.S essentially

261
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,399
imposed this on the rest of the world

262
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:35,819
and is ambivalent about the impact of

263
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,100
you know that obligation domestically in

264
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,899
terms of federal legalization there is

265
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,800
kind of perennial conversation about it

266
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,600
but uh I'm I'm a little cynical at this

267
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,179
point I just don't think that it's

268
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,120
likely to happen I think that uh you

269
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,739
know the Biden had his his chance uh

270
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,179
when he had control over both houses or

271
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,180
the Democrats rather had control over

272
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:59,819
both houses of Congress and now that um

273
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,159
the House Representatives is uh in

274
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,420
control uh with the Republican party I

275
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,578
just think it's very unlikely that

276
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:08,278
there'll be legislation that makes it

277
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:09,659
through Congress to legalize cannabis

278
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,639
um in the in the near terms so I think

279
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,620
there's going to have to be you know in

280
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,720
terms of just the sequencing another

281
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,759
election where there's the the party in

282
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,860
power for Congress and the president

283
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,778
that supports legalization which at this

284
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,700
point and historically the Republicans

285
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:25,740
are just not in favor of that

286
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,620
um so I think probably what the future

287
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,899
is going to look like for the us as much

288
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,159
of How It's looked um so far which is

289
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,799
sort of this piecemeal approach

290
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,039
different states essentially being the

291
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,679
laboratory of ideas and trying to enact

292
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,778
their own policies that have some

293
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,879
commonalities but are fairly disjointed

294
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:48,000
which is really problematic actually

295
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,639
because you know kind of similar to how

296
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,740
it is at least described with how Kai

297
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,379
described with the EU is there's no real

298
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,019
common denominator for policy in the U.S

299
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:00,899
other than prohibition so basically the

300
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,060
U.S policy federally is that cannabis is

301
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:06,480
the same as heroin whereas when we're

302
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,359
talking about California where I am you

303
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
know medical use has been legal since

304
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,720
1996

305
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,240
legalization was enacted by the voters

306
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,100
in 2016

307
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,259
and so you know you can go to a lot of

308
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,659
different parts of the state access

309
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:23,039
cannabis legally obviously not treated

310
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,838
like heroin but the federal government

311
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,480
still has it as a schedule and

312
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,220
controlled substance so it's somewhat of

313
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,200
a schizophrenic approach I think both

314
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,519
with respect to international law and

315
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,980
domestically

316
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,778
thank you Andrew let's go over to you

317
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,360
what's the status on cannabis

318
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:42,179
legalization in Malta and say if I were

319
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,800
on holiday there could I just go and

320
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,319
visit a social club and get some

321
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,240
cannabis well it's early days obviously

322
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,579
Malta is on the tip of everyone's tongue

323
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,740
at the moment because it has the most

324
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,778
Progressive law in Europe

325
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,519
um but if you actually look at what the

326
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,278
law is saying you'll find out that it's

327
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,078
nowhere near legalized it is closer to

328
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,759
some some sort of decriminalization

329
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,219
would say maybe a partial

330
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,899
decriminalization and what we have in

331
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,759
the law is we can grow up to four plants

332
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,440
without being criminalized

333
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:15,000
and we can have seven grams of cannabis

334
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,300
possession out in public

335
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,700
you can expunge your criminal records

336
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:23,338
and also there is the biggest part of

337
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,959
the law which would be the issuing of

338
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,120
licenses to open

339
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,099
um what were meant to be Social Clubs

340
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,320
but unfortunately you know along the

341
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,420
line you know there's a lot of politics

342
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,820
involved and prime ministers fall and

343
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,379
you get a new one ministers change and

344
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,899
the topic goes from one Ministry to

345
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:42,958
another and Gets Lost in Translation

346
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,059
with no Handover I don't know if this is

347
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,799
in all politics but unfortunately it's

348
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,439
what happened in Malta so we don't

349
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,599
really have a model which is going to be

350
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,519
either social and there's going to be no

351
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,339
Club so they've decided to call them

352
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,698
associations which is going to be based

353
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,560
more on a dispensary system so

354
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,599
um you you have to be obviously a member

355
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,179
of this club where you can go and

356
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,100
acquire your cannabis and take it home

357
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:10,919
but you know licenses have just been

358
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,980
issued now like literally last week and

359
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,599
so applications basically but still

360
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,459
those people that applied don't even

361
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,800
know what the final license fee is going

362
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:23,159
to be so it's kind of

363
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:25,259
um being rolled out and being formed as

364
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,838
they go along and I'm happy to say that

365
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,819
my organization is involved obviously as

366
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,860
much as possible to try and shape policy

367
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,260
to make sure that it's um just an

368
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,060
effective policy

369
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,860
yeah that's super interesting I mean

370
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,599
it's in general very important to be

371
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,360
involved in the discussion some of the

372
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,620
rules don't make are made with you and

373
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,139
not for you

374
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,240
um so color let's move over to you some

375
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,459
homegrown and Social Clubs do they play

376
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,919
or did they play a role during the

377
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,659
legalization efforts in U.S states and

378
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,198
what would you recommend to lawmakers

379
00:15:54,659 --> 00:16:00,899
under the debate in Europe on this

380
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,698
so uh canopy Social Clubs actually have

381
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,399
existed in the United States for a while

382
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:08,099
in the 1920s they were called teapots

383
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,078
and they were bars where people went and

384
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,959
listened to jazz music and and small

385
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,778
cannabis and they disappeared after

386
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:20,219
cannabis became illegal but they they

387
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:23,159
have a player role definitely and

388
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,379
um uh we see that there is a path toward

389
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,059
legalization and and we're kind of

390
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:30,360
position clubs and homegrown cannabis is

391
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:32,518
generally part of this regularization in

392
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,278
the 1973 that's how we started in the

393
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,019
United States with Oregon

394
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:39,720
followed by California and Alaska and

395
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,519
Colorado and one very important thing to

396
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,440
keep me in mind after so many years of

397
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,659
bad propaganda in cannabis is

398
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,699
responsible use and this canopy Social

399
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:50,519
Clubs promote these responsible use

400
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:54,059
where people have a place to go and and

401
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,919
consume cannabis in a social setting and

402
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,138
the the states in the United States that

403
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,240
have legalized cannabis but have not

404
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,180
regulated these social clubs are somehow

405
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,980
handicapped because you can you can

406
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,220
purchase cannabis but you don't have a

407
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,798
place to to go and smoke it and

408
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,480
uh

409
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:16,798
what what we've seen for example in

410
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,480
States like California you you where

411
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,119
where the the canopy social groups have

412
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,640
been regulated is that you can go and

413
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,678
you can the dispensary licensees allow

414
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,179
you to also consume cannabis there there

415
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,940
are different approaches for example in

416
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,220
New York it's more of a of a separate uh

417
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,460
the same way as alcohol Works kind of

418
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,339
where you have you can go purchase uh

419
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,600
cannabis uh like a liquor store you

420
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,939
cannot consume it there but you can

421
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,639
purchase it and consume it at home or

422
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,440
you have the the the the retail license

423
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,259
where you can go and and purchase

424
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,519
cannabis but you cannot so the retail

425
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,900
license would be like the liquor store

426
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,639
and then you have the consumption

427
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,580
license where you can go and consummate

428
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,580
there and New York is actually issuing

429
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:01,558
the first licenses this summer New

430
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:04,740
Jersey also has

431
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,779
um included just past some regulations

432
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,500
on kind of a social clubs and and

433
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:13,139
homeroom cannabis and I think for from

434
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,419
the European lawmakers which we should

435
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,720
keep in mind that legalization should

436
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,720
have

437
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,798
in mind that the safety and quality of

438
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,960
the products it should definitely

439
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,058
include uh what I was mentioning about

440
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,640
responsible use and it should recognize

441
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:32,519
the benefits of cannabis such as

442
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,259
reducing uh um the burden on law

443
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,460
enforcement and reducing the criminal

444
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,859
activities

445
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,019
that's very true

446
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:42,178
um Kai decriminalization and Collective

447
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,700
home growth are caliber Social Clubs as

448
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,400
a possible Plan B has been discussed is

449
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,558
this compatible with EU law and scheng

450
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,419
and a queen and framework decision

451
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,960
okay as I mentioned before you

452
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:59,280
everything is disputed but this is in

453
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,400
the most justifiable justifiable way out

454
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,940
of this

455
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,900
decriminalization yes this is a

456
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:13,080
article 3 of the framework decision is

457
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:15,179
talking about personal consumption but

458
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:18,000
think about cannabis Social Clubs in

459
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,519
Hamburg Frankfurt Hanover Berlin a

460
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,298
thousand members 5 000 members imagine

461
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:28,019
what a growth this would be the plan is

462
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:31,918
that you can legally grow three plants

463
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:34,319
three flowering plants at one time and

464
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,140
so you have the

465
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,538
the the plants in the early stages and

466
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,419
uh as soon as they turn into a flower

467
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:44,460
ring you have to get rid of one or you

468
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,980
have to have a better management of this

469
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,700
but if you delegate this weight right to

470
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,620
a canopy Social Club so uh you have 10

471
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,600
000 members then you can have three

472
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,298
flower three thousand flowering plants

473
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,579
at one time

474
00:19:56,298 --> 00:20:01,319
if that is compatible with with EU log

475
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:02,599
with these provision in article three of

476
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:07,798
the framework decision

477
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:10,500
you know so but it's anytime we talk

478
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:13,918
about cannabis legally on a global

479
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:17,700
illegally and globally uh you you will

480
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,840
never get a clear way a clear regulation

481
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,220
without any justify

482
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,759
arguments and and some some

483
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:31,380
circumvention routes in augmentation

484
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:33,179
that is like it is and but the Social

485
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,799
Democratic party is very much in favor

486
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,259
of the Cannabis Social Club

487
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,980
because they think you have you can

488
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:43,079
exercise a social control

489
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,900
within the association with the members

490
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:48,480
and they want to really promote that and

491
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,160
give a clear legal framework for that so

492
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:57,599
that you can really have a huge

493
00:20:52,160 --> 00:21:01,919
numbers a huge associations and

494
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:06,178
I think this is a good way to go so for

495
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,640
first start for for Germany and it it's

496
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,820
possible to to to realize that really

497
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,160
after the decision in bonus attack and

498
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,980
I'm really looking much looking forward

499
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,679
to that yeah maybe also to mention the

500
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,720
associations are an important thing in

501
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,080
Germany anyways we have like Association

502
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,579
for ducks hound breeders bowling clubs

503
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:28,259
and whatever so we have a lot of

504
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,178
associations also for patients for

505
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,339
example so it's an important role in

506
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:35,038
Germany I mean and look in the scene

507
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:38,639
here in Barcelona is how many social

508
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,640
clubs hundreds over 100 and they have a

509
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,100
cultural event

510
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,440
program you have bands you have DJing

511
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:50,099
you can come together share your

512
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,320
experience share your grow experience I

513
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:55,319
think that's perfect for stock

514
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,720
uh Carla let's go back to you

515
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,519
um the Social Clubs in Spain what's your

516
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,200
opinion on that and how well do you

517
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,839
think are those regulated

518
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,720
well so cannabis Social Clubs in Spain

519
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,519
uh operate under a legal limbo the

520
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,519
international single convention on

521
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:15,918
narcotic trucks was ratified by Spain in

522
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:19,019
1966 and it prohibits the

523
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,600
production the public possession the

524
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,819
trafficking and the use of cannabis so

525
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:27,599
the stipulation on public possession is

526
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:29,720
where everything comes around here so

527
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,339
um the the

528
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,220
private possession consumption in Canada

529
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,899
in in Spain is basically decriminalized

530
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,480
so

531
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,860
um the canopy Social Clubs here work a

532
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,900
little bit like the Netherlands Social

533
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,279
Club so the difference that they are not

534
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,919
open to the public so it's like a

535
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,619
member-only club you have to to be a

536
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,900
member it's it's a member invite only

537
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,819
type of Club so generally you can only

538
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,000
join the clubs viewer if you're invited

539
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:59,279
by another existing member and it's an

540
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,980
area where where people go and pay a

541
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,440
membership fee the membership it doesn't

542
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,839
go towards the purchase of cannabis

543
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,519
because the the cannabis clubs are

544
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,339
non-profit organizations so they can

545
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,960
have a commercial purpose so

546
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:14,699
um the membership fee that you pay is

547
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,919
basically towards the grow of the blend

548
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,360
and the maintenance of the social club

549
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,759
itself and other places most of the

550
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,339
clubs are here in Catalonia they're uh

551
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,400
quite a number of clubs also in El Pais

552
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:31,918
Vasco and here in Catalonia they are

553
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,259
somehow regulated so there are certain

554
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,960
um factors that need to be followed from

555
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:38,819
a perspective of of Public Health and

556
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,159
and the amount of calories that can be

557
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:42,240
sold to an individual within a period of

558
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,980
time

559
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,919
um but other places where the social

560
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,240
clubs are not um regulated under local

561
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,400
law

562
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,440
um there are concerns over potential

563
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,440
criminal activities that that take place

564
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,480
in these Social Clubs because of the

565
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,940
potential High revenues that they can

566
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,860
generate and the low chance of being

567
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,120
prosecuted

568
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:08,279
um so I mean Spain should definitely

569
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:11,038
take steps towards uh regulating the

570
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,500
Social Clubs in a in a more complete way

571
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,460
because currently they're just operating

572
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,460
under a gray area

573
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,140
um Andrew let's go back to you so we

574
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,298
heard this discussion also with EU law

575
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,700
single convention

576
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,679
um is there a position in Malta on that

577
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,140
and are there any statement on human

578
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,759
rights as in the case of Uruguay for

579
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,700
example or on Better Health protection

580
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,980
is this an important driver yes I mean

581
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,279
there is not an official position from

582
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,839
Malta but they have been to the incb

583
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,000
um the The Ambassador in Vienna has

584
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,519
actually spoken to the incb and of

585
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,440
course the the human rights obligation

586
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,720
is being used a lot together with Health

587
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,700
and Social Justice which is where the

588
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,919
Cannabis Social Club model fits in

589
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,900
perfectly because it's a decriminalized

590
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,059
system and you are basically flying

591
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,460
under the radar of the the single

592
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:03,839
convention so no no rules are really

593
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,880
being broken

594
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,379
and it's an easy way to go forward and

595
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,020
you can understand that Malta obviously

596
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,659
isn't going to go going to you know

597
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,639
um go for complete legalization like

598
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,919
maybe Germany has more muscle to be able

599
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,360
to do that and challenge so I can

600
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,460
understand that most of being a smaller

601
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,259
country has decided obviously wanted to

602
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,340
reform with the new government that came

603
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:28,500
in in 2013 there was a strong urge um to

604
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:30,119
actually make this reform

605
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,679
um but obviously they you know when you

606
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,839
look at the rules and regulations you

607
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,759
realize what you really can and where

608
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,740
the big challenges are and the big

609
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,319
challenges we know is basically that

610
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,460
commercial sale which is prohibited so

611
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,678
you know when you have a Social Club

612
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,019
model which is sort of built by the

613
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,960
community for the community offering a

614
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:50,759
safe space and obviously also a perfect

615
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,940
space to introduce harm reduction

616
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,980
measures this obviously fits in with the

617
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,740
human rights obligation as well so this

618
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,900
is pretty much acceptable and so that's

619
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,038
the route we we we're taking and when it

620
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,600
comes to

621
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,058
um speaking with the EU and it's

622
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,500
important to keep dialogue open

623
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:10,079
um explain to them exactly what we're

624
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,819
doing we have an agency which is um

625
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,439
called The Authority for the responsible

626
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:15,178
use of cannabis which has been set up

627
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,919
and is in the in the process of

628
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:18,240
employing more people

629
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,820
um and and getting the framework

630
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,259
together so the you know the European

631
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,899
commission knows exactly what is going

632
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:27,778
on there's there's open dialogue and so

633
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,778
far we haven't had any problems so is it

634
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:32,339
a plan B for Germany I mean I I think so

635
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:34,200
because at the end of the day it's it's

636
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,058
a safe route

637
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,860
um it's one which I know the Grassroots

638
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:39,298
movement and actual consumers would be

639
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,038
happy with

640
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:43,019
um but and then obviously you know

641
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,339
commercialization is something that you

642
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,558
can't avoid this is something that's

643
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,418
going to come in but we truly truly

644
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,399
believe especially my organization my

645
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,038
organization believes that we should be

646
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,440
building from the bottom up and once we

647
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,720
do that then industry can come in and

648
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,679
and play together with the community so

649
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,538
that way

650
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,159
um you leave no cracks in the in the

651
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,298
foundation of building a new framework

652
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,380
so the social shops are step one and the

653
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:09,058
commercialization potentially a second

654
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,039
step well commercialization is

655
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:12,899
inevitable and it's something that has

656
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,879
to happen but I think it's important

657
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,038
that one country doesn't go It Alone

658
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,080
when trying to challenge this I think

659
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,058
that if if the like-minded countries can

660
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,980
get together and and have a solid

661
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,899
proposal I think it will make much more

662
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,759
sense and be easier to move forward that

663
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,440
way yeah

664
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,960
um Joe you've been doing this for a very

665
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,058
very long time so um what would you

666
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,278
recommend to EU member states who want

667
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:37,259
to legalize or regulate cannabis adult

668
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,179
use cannabis in regard to the experience

669
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,919
you made in the US

670
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,679
lots of stuff

671
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,840
um so

672
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:48,480
we've we made a lot of mistakes in in

673
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,918
the U.S particularly in California and I

674
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,278
would say that sort of the over

675
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,340
commercialization is a problem uh we saw

676
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,079
after legalization just this sort of

677
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:58,939
hyper

678
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,918
um

679
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,600
hyperactive capitalization of companies

680
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,360
that were not mature enough to take on

681
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,778
the money the businesses didn't really

682
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:12,119
have a model to be able to responsibly

683
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:13,919
use that investment money there was

684
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,199
there's just a lot of examples of

685
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
companies getting you know 50 million

686
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,919
dollars a hundred million dollars and

687
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,960
squandering it

688
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,080
um and I think a lot of people in

689
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,940
California in particular would feel that

690
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:31,139
the model that existed under the medical

691
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,480
laws from about 2004 until 2017 when

692
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,700
legalization was implemented is superior

693
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,460
to the legalization model and that's the

694
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,140
model that we had basically these

695
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,440
collectives and cooperatives that

696
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,700
qualified patients that time could

697
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,159
collectively associate to cultivate

698
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,620
medical cannabis and provide that to the

699
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,140
qualified patient members same as what

700
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:53,759
Kai was describing with Germany we could

701
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,038
aggregate the number of plants per

702
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,379
patient and get to a larger number of

703
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:00,839
plans to be produced and then provided

704
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,720
to those patients and also through a

705
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,519
non-profit model for all of the flaws

706
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,700
that that model had

707
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,038
it worked it was successful for a long

708
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,140
period of time and Legacy cannabis

709
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,980
industry operators were able to be

710
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,899
successful for 10 years 15 years under

711
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,120
that model and then legalization

712
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:23,459
happened because so much money went into

713
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,819
it and there was so much hype and the

714
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,980
regulations were just unsettled the laws

715
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:31,019
were unsettled federal law as we just

716
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,620
discussed is not helpful

717
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:37,158
all of that stuff sort of conspired

718
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:39,439
together to make legalization really

719
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:42,299
challenging to implement in California

720
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,058
and that's just sort of one state out of

721
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:48,778
50 states and so you know when you look

722
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:51,480
at at most parts of America almost

723
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:54,058
nowhere can you have on-site social

724
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,298
consumption almost entirely what the

725
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:59,398
model is is like off sale uh retail

726
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:01,558
where you can go and purchase it and

727
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:03,599
then consume it essentially only in your

728
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,599
home and usually only if you own your

729
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,240
home because a lot of rental leases have

730
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,398
conditions like non-smoking rules as a

731
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,740
part of that lease and so then you have

732
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:16,918
a situation where people can consume

733
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,319
cannabis at their home or in public

734
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,820
which is generally prohibited a lot of

735
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,259
people consume in their cars which is

736
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,859
obviously not a good idea and also

737
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:28,679
prohibited so I think actually the

738
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:30,719
Germany Plan B maybe should be plan A

739
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,179
you know the the legalization of having

740
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,000
a model of more of a sort of

741
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,340
pharmaceutical base model a monopoly

742
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,679
type model is I don't think going to be

743
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:43,678
as beneficial as something that is more

744
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,380
Grassroots more bottom up more focused

745
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,759
on the people and the organizations that

746
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,100
have been a part of legalization from

747
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,658
the beginning and to rely on them and

748
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,839
their expertise their knowledge to carry

749
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,840
forward

750
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,419
um so um Jessica step in here and I see

751
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,519
the problem when you have these two

752
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:05,520
Roots so you have to Social Club model

753
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,980
and a commercial route you have to

754
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,079
protect the commercial route and you

755
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,319
have to make sure that these Social Club

756
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:16,319
idea is really restrained to to a

757
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,639
community to a social club to the

758
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,220
members and the members taking it

759
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,500
seriously and it's not it can't be that

760
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,278
the social clubs are in fact commercial

761
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,058
businesses just taking the restricted

762
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,480
the the

763
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:34,440
um the um the easier rules for for for

764
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,599
operating because the commercial would

765
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,240
have to be licensed there will have to

766
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,819
be invests in retail stores and Retail

767
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,740
structures in and you have to really

768
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:46,139
really separate that and you have to

769
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,359
control that as well so the Cannabis

770
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,740
Social Club must be a social model and

771
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,740
not a hidden business model

772
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,538
um those two things can exist in

773
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:59,459
parallel they're not mutually exclusive

774
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:01,798
and I think the social club model is a

775
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,720
good backstop against the sort of

776
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,778
full-fledged

777
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,778
um capitalistic approach uh that I think

778
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:12,000
has really been problematic uh for Los

779
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:14,220
Angeles which is in particular which is

780
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,359
maybe the largest cannabis Market in the

781
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,759
world

782
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,219
um has utterly failed to implement

783
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,019
legalization on on every level and it's

784
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,339
a huge disappointment for the industry

785
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:24,538
it's a huge disappointment I know for me

786
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:26,639
personally

787
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:28,740
um and I think

788
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,720
um you know different countries within

789
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,819
the EU can do a much better job than

790
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,819
we've done domestically in the U.S if

791
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:37,619
they they learn from our our lessons and

792
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:39,480
they kind of move the policy forward in

793
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:40,319
a way that um I think it really should

794
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,980
be

795
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,538
thank you um so maybe one last uh final

796
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,759
question before we move on to the

797
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:49,859
audience for all of you um maybe one

798
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,619
quick sentence statement what should

799
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:55,459
division look like for the EU and Global

800
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,459
cannabis legalization

801
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,919
um a robust system which makes global

802
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:04,099
trade possible

803
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,220
foreign

804
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:11,939
I'd say create a system that is uh on

805
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,038
parity with how alcohol is regulated so

806
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,778
if you have a model in in your country

807
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,879
where you can freely buy it and consume

808
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:20,038
it whatever those age limits are just

809
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,080
adopt that same model to cannabis it

810
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,778
works with alcohol it can work with

811
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,839
cannabis and you don't have to create an

812
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:30,058
entirely new and weird and separate

813
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,319
model just for cannabis it really

814
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:33,178
doesn't need to be like that and that's

815
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,058
something I think that if that was

816
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:38,340
implemented in the U.S we would have a

817
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:39,538
far better cannabis system of

818
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:42,298
regulations and laws than we do

819
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:44,819
currently kind of um I think it should

820
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:47,579
be seen from a perspective of safety

821
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:50,639
Public Health social equity and research

822
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:52,019
and Innovation from a public health

823
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,700
perspective what I mentioned about

824
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,859
responsible use is very important to

825
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,840
promote responsible use from a safety

826
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:59,839
perspective I think there should be

827
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:05,219
robust testing requirements to make sure

828
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:08,780
the products that we bring to the market

829
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:12,720
are are safe and of high quality

830
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:14,700
the communities of color and low-income

831
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,559
communities have been negatively

832
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:20,219
impacted and disproportionately impacted

833
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:23,039
by the uh but by prohibition so I think

834
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,898
that this community should have access

835
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,779
to the benefits of a legal cannabis

836
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:29,039
market and there should be constant

837
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,740
research and Innovation to make sure we

838
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,300
we have a quality cannabis based

839
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,319
products in the market and there should

840
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,859
definitely be an international

841
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,500
perspective on on the legalization

842
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,539
I think the EU needs to take a good hard

843
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,739
look at the criminalization that is

844
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,898
still happening in different countries

845
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,819
and look at the statistics and see how

846
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:49,079
many people's lives are getting ruined

847
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,599
at the moment for simple possession

848
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,639
cultivation or consumption

849
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,080
um and I realized that prohibition is

850
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,720
doing obviously more damage than the

851
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,338
plant itself so once once they take a

852
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,779
good hard look at the figures and the

853
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:02,400
statistics then they they can realize

854
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,900
that obviously we have to move some to

855
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,059
some sort of Reform with

856
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,519
decriminalization I feel being the first

857
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,320
step that's very important in Germany we

858
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:13,019
have over 200

859
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,480
000 criminal cases prosecuted for

860
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:18,239
personal consumption so thank you to the

861
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,460
panelists open the floor for questions

862
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,719
um we just have six minutes left so I

863
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,720
can only take one or two

864
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,019
hi thank you uh very much for a very

865
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:33,420
informative and engaging uh panel uh

866
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,338
actually Carla just started to touch on

867
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,260
this at the end of the subject and and

868
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:40,500
one of the interesting contrasts between

869
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,599
uh the U.S and Europe is that uh the

870
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,838
consumption lounges came as sort of a a

871
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,660
secondary proposal to the commercial uh

872
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,219
regulations uh whereas here it seems

873
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:52,078
like the consumption lounges are more

874
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:55,439
the foot in the door uh to commercial

875
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,940
legalization uh the problem is that I

876
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,519
see is that well I mean I guess the

877
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,380
opportunity uh that with the consumption

878
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,780
Lounge is coming later is licensing

879
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,059
around consumption lounges licensing

880
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,220
around deliveries and the relatively low

881
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:11,400
barriers to entry associated with those

882
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:15,539
made them a very attractive licenses for

883
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,639
social Equity applicants and I I don't

884
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:20,400
see is it cute a problem in Europe

885
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,199
around social equity and the impact of

886
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,358
the War on Drugs to disproportionately

887
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,358
impacted communities but it is an issue

888
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:30,119
in Europe as well so if these

889
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,619
consumption lounges are sort of the the

890
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,900
foot in the door for the larger

891
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,480
commercial interests uh how do you see

892
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:40,619
the evolution of cannabis policy within

893
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Europe in embracing uh the the Legacy

894
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:44,579
market and those communities that have

895
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,800
been disproportionately impacted by

896
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,720
prohibition thank you

897
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,560
well I think

898
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,519
um

899
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,960
it's it's important to to to

900
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:56,519
do something similar to what was done in

901
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,699
the United States I think that the

902
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:02,159
social Equity licenses were were uh uh

903
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:03,598
the intention was a very good intention

904
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,480
um the problem that has happened is that

905
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,880
a lot of investors have basically

906
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,639
um taken over these licenses and the

907
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,700
social Equity applicants have been uh

908
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:16,019
put in in a second stage uh so so the

909
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,659
intention was good I think it's

910
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:22,320
important to give special license to

911
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:24,480
these to these um uh applicants but it

912
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,220
should be done in a way to to protect to

913
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,420
protect their interests because it

914
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:28,919
hasn't been done

915
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,440
um the way it was intended in the United

916
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,519
States I don't know if Joe you have a

917
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,960
different opinion

918
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:40,199
uh well so I I agree

919
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,579
um completely that we need to take care

920
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:43,799
of the communities that have been the

921
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:46,320
most harmed from the War on Drugs in the

922
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,060
United States it's a very problematic

923
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,099
and troubled history with respect to

924
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:52,559
communities of color in particular and

925
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:54,900
how those communities have been impacted

926
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,820
by prohibition and disproportionate

927
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,500
incarcer and all those things the

928
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,039
problem with how we've dealt with social

929
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,739
Equity is that we really haven't ignored

930
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,420
the benefits of legalization to those

931
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:09,239
communities all we've done with our

932
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:12,300
programs is given basically a better

933
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,098
spot in line to the the permits that are

934
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,380
issued at a municipal level

935
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:19,140
so what that means is to Carla's Point

936
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,760
uh there is you know companies that are

937
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:24,059
forced like in the LA social Equity

938
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,040
program they're forced uh to have a

939
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:28,858
social Equity component to their

940
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:31,380
application in order to be able to to

941
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:33,179
get a local permit which is prerequisite

942
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,760
to a state license and that's how one

943
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:37,919
becomes legal uh but those relationships

944
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,720
are very exploitative and what ends up

945
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,300
happening is the social Equity applicant

946
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,639
ends up not being benefited from that

947
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,780
relationship they're just used from that

948
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,598
relationship

949
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,000
so I think should happen is looking at

950
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,500
more of a community benefit model where

951
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,019
instead of just giving preferential

952
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,420
treatment to you know someone's ability

953
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:59,759
to get a permit first that ultimately

954
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:02,280
doesn't matter what matters is that the

955
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,920
communities that are underprivileged

956
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,260
that are underserved that are just

957
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,200
inadequately represented in basically

958
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,940
all ways they get access to benefits

959
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,219
that come from Cannabis even if they

960
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,420
don't consume cannabis uh you know writ

961
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,759
large to individuals in those

962
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,220
communities where we have tax dollars

963
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,200
for example derived from Cannabis to

964
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:24,419
fund social programs for communities

965
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:25,679
that need them that's the solution I

966
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,838
think not just getting preferential

967
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,899
treatment online and that's a big big

968
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:34,259
reason why a lot of like the the bigger

969
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,780
metropolitan areas in the U.S and in

970
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,579
California particular have really failed

971
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,280
with their local permitting is they're

972
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:43,920
focused on on this really just

973
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,720
inadequate model of trying to help

974
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,700
social Equity communities and programs

975
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,219
pounds in a way that doesn't actually

976
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:52,319
help them the benefits may be driven to

977
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:54,899
communities not preferential treatment

978
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,000
in one permit application for one

979
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,858
applicant who ends up getting exploited

980
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,719
by the investors oftentimes in that

981
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:02,880
company yeah thank you for saying that

982
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,098
it's very important and I think it's a

983
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,960
good last word if you have any questions

984
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,619
