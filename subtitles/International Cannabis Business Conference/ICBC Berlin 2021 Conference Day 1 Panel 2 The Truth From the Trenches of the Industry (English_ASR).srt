1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,400
well uh guten morgen um nick easley

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,960
managing director multiverse cap also

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,719
ceo of 3c consulting been in the space

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,920
for 15 years

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,679
so from the legal industry in colorado

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,439
everything i'm going to say today is

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,000
from the trenches of the industry from

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,660
working with thousands of companies

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,800
first quick little disclaimer though

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,800
[Music]

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,719
interesting um not a lawyer i'm not a

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,440
cpa

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,359
you have to use these professionals as

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,119
this isn't like 2006 2010 in california

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,479
setting up weird businesses

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,679
you must seek out very good counsel very

17
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,279
good like

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,039
everything when it comes to this because

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,000
this industry we've been doing this for

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,160
now nearly two decades legally

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
and without these professionals all the

22
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,198
businesses that we've seen fail had crap

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
illegal didn't understand tax structures

24
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,759
and there's very unique tax structures

25
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,518
in the united states based on irc 280e

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,599
just like if you have

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
companies in the netherlands like bbs

28
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,438
here that are doing investments here how

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,000
companies are structured

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,599
matters as all of you individuals know

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
most of these companies this is a

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,599
startup industry full of startup

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,478
companies so there's high levels of risk

34
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,478
just make sure you use those

35
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,199
all right a quick little bit of

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,320
background

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
um

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,679
originally from farm country in

39
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,199
wisconsin you know kind of poor farm kid

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,560
area

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,560
was in the united states air

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,280
so i force languages to the military and

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
which is actually really helpful for

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
when you go from enforcing the drug war

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,478
in south america to now actually like

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,759
being one of the largest producers in

47
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,200
south america and working with those

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,079
organizations

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,960
um i got hurt in the service and went to

50
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,158
colorado to be a ski bum big fan

51
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,759
and

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
tried medical cannabis it was a really

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,200
big help for me so in 2006 i got a

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
medical card

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
and started using medical cannabis and

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,000
realized how people were growing it they

57
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,799
had no idea now colorado was the first

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,159
legal medical commercial program in the

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
world

60
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,400
where you could actually sell it granted

61
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,919
next door in the netherlands 2005 the

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
challenge

63
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,519
like they started but

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,640
realistically like for sanctioned legal

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,959
sales colorado is where we started also

66
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,439
first the w's market regulated marijuana

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
like alcohol in 2012

68
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,959
we passed before washington for the

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
first recreational cannabis in the

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,959
history of the world

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,280
next year in the netherlands not so much

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
legal kind of happens gray area which

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
we'll get into

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,959
but having worked down the united states

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,598
through over 36 states from a medical

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,159
standpoint we have 19 adult use states

77
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,919
11 of which have current sales

78
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,519
close probably i had 30 billion in

79
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,719
revenue this year in the united states

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,239
alone canada like 2.5 billion

81
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,840
you know make fun of canada a little bit

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,680
but back on that disclaimer just make

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,759
sure everything i'm going to share with

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,800
you is like truth from the industry if i

85
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,560
offend you your country your investments

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,560
you can't fix stupid

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,840
so i'm not here to offend them it's just

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,199
like the truth and when you fight the

89
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,959
truth you lose so a big thing um that we

90
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,479
learned you know

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,239
medical cannabis has been expanding

92
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,919
internationally there's a very big

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
difference in medical campus in the

94
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,559
united states

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,480
canada and uruguay compared to the rest

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,479
of the world the same with adult use

97
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,639
adult use in canada

98
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,639
legal from the from the government

99
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,279
everything we do in the united states is

100
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,039
federally illegal like i might violate

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,878
federal law every day you think pablo

102
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,400
escobar that's what we do in the united

103
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:49,039
states but we follow state law like i

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,200
never have broken a state law for campus

105
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,120
and uh federal we just try not to think

106
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,719
about that much but we're kind of like a

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
little big now so it's kind of like

108
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,759
happening there is like schumersville

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,519
the morax care act none of those are

110
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,199
going to happen so from a federal

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
legalization standpoint in the united

112
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,438
states we're always away and everything

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,039
on the table is not going to happen but

114
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,039
on a global standpoint it's a

115
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,598
compassionate use medical program under

116
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,079
the 1961 single treaty on psychotropic

117
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,759
substances from the united nations which

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,759
currently the united states and many

119
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
countries are in violation of because

120
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
some very big news happened this last

121
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,120
year

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
so there was a delayed vote with the

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
commission for narcotic drugs under the

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
international narcotics control board

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,478
for the u.n so the cnd the commission

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
for narcotics drugs

127
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,719
kind of quietly this last december which

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
is supposed to be march before but then

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
run up

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,360
um

131
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
we rescheduled canvas internationally at

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,879
the unl

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
so canvas is no longer the same as

134
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,399
heroin

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,759
like it was forever so it went to a

136
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,519
different schedule schedule three

137
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,479
knowing that it actually has additional

138
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,039
value

139
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,959
needs more medical research

140
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,479
so that's a big deal for investors to

141
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,319
know like we're not talking about heroin

142
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,839
anymore and we're single trafficking

143
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,519
cannabis yeah there's all these new

144
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,879
psychedelic kind of industries i think

145
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,639
personally and the agents are going to

146
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,240
be great for the mind for the body for

147
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,038
scientific research we're

148
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,478
single-tracking campus only do one crazy

149
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,038
thing at a time don't

150
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,478
you drink and drive and see

151
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,319
drinking driving

152
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,000
one weird thing at a time

153
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,879
if you're gonna do cannabis don't do

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,720
cannabis in cryptocurrency like one

155
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,439
weird thing at a time

156
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,440
but as you invoke it change things

157
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,519
and it's freaking ukraine

158
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,120
out of the blue or when they were doing

159
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,319
that vote it was like two in the morning

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,959
my time ukraine was gonna sing and he

161
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,639
looked forward he's like yes

162
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,719
he was like holy

163
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,960
it's like it happened by one vote and it

164
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,120
was ukraine seventh and ukraine didn't

165
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,879
then like pass them out of the bill

166
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,478
about a month and a half two months ago

167
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,839
but ukraine

168
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,758
yes ukraine they changed it big time so

169
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,000
the little thing happened this last year

170
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,759
growing up kind of unfortunate when it

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
comes to like cannabis investments and

172
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,720
what happened massive supply chain

173
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
eruptions

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,319
all this massive proliferation of

175
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
international expansion that we've been

176
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
doing in the united states international

177
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
security market sharing all these places

178
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,240
have changed the cost of construction

179
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,560
balloon steel packaging everything is so

180
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,079
much more delayed so for investments as

181
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,680
you were securing all these positions

182
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,839
and then we couldn't fly and actually

183
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,720
take care of these portfolio companies

184
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,119
got crazy like when the one

185
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,400
caps away the mice will play i see a lot

186
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
of faces in here who know like i've

187
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,000
worked with you in africa and south

188
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,519
america in asia and it's like what's

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
going on in that country

190
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,560
we don't know we can't get there like

191
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
they're spending crazy money how do you

192
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
do a hospital takeover in a country you

193
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,758
can't even get into

194
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,439
so this was an opportunity it was like

195
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,919
warren buffett said like never let a

196
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,199
good crisis go to waste this was a

197
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,439
crisis of attrition and it was literally

198
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
the moment that no one realizes now what

199
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,759
happened in march last year on march

200
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
21st when the stock market was like

201
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
its hands

202
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,918
we were doubling i didn't sleep for four

203
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,000
days like i was buying companies on a

204
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,240
public market that i normally think of

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
garbage that i wouldn't touch i hate

206
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
their executives i've known them from

207
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,759
their starts when their stock was going

208
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,280
from like 25 to 19 to and forty cents a

209
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,000
share was like

210
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,799
like

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,478
crazy deployments in capital also then

212
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
during this time a lot of these public

213
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,758
companies had no good liquidity on the

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
books

215
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,360
so they were massively unloading assets

216
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,319
like things that can't be did in spain

217
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
for example spent 50 60 million euros to

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
secure some of these positions these

219
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,079
initial things and they're like we were

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,319
buying stuff for pennies on the dollar

221
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,120
and like now like that 240 cent share

222
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,879
that's up at like 15. so

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,879
sadly even though many of you if you

224
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
know me i talk a lot of crap on canadian

225
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
public companies

226
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,319
and then some of the shell-listed ones

227
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,759
on the csc and the tsx that actually

228
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,598
don't invest in the united states and

229
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,038
our companies are listed up there

230
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,399
because it's federally legal in the

231
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,159
united states

232
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,439
but that's where the money is and that's

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,840
where the change is happening and

234
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,519
there's still a moment to get into some

235
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,439
of these huge things here

236
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,198
so in companies as they're raising the

237
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,719
capital which when you think of your

238
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
vetting investment opportunities here in

239
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,360
europe there are not many and most of

240
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,520
them are garbage there have been a few

241
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,520
with kenobo and a few others like on the

242
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,878
london exchange you're going to see more

243
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,639
starting out frankfurt exchange

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,080
television

245
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,478
canada has been where like most of the

246
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,359
action is but canada with 40 million

247
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,240
people

248
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,000
already a very illicit market that's

249
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
been happening it's not where

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
international campus is really going to

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,918
take effect so a lot of people lost

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
their asses in canada investing in

253
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,559
massive big things

254
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,800
compared to like small private companies

255
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,958
that were scaling the united states when

256
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,319
it's federally illegal in the united

257
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,000
states we have this tax code irc

258
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,360
very important because the united states

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,720
is where we're going to talk and make

260
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
it's where we make all of our money that

261
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
allows all of our international

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,360
expansion all i've done is spent

263
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,360
hundreds of millions of dollars around

264
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
the world securing positions nurturing

265
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,399
companies because we don't grow

266
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,480
pineapples in canada in warehouses

267
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,000
to like have pineapples there it's like

268
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
they come from other countries the same

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
with coffee the same with other things

270
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,839
so you have to think like longer term

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,680
and as investors you know you've got

272
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
like your short positions your mediums

273
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,599
your long what are your long-term

274
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,159
strategic visions and sometimes just

275
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,320
like a short squeeze it'll kill you if

276
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,079
it squeezes you for too long and that's

277
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,360
what happened with canopy and tons of

278
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
these other companies they held all

279
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,600
these positions had all these shorts and

280
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
they just had to like

281
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,040
massive shitty in their books to get

282
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,679
things and then you would see like

283
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,079
tillery buying like national the harvest

284
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,919
long established like hemp seed company

285
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,200
just because it does gravity like

286
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,719
they're buying all these other companies

287
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
just to look like look at all this

288
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,399
revenue we're making just to trick

289
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,199
investors to keep their stock prices

290
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,559
high but it's very hard to raise capital

291
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,278
from these small-scale and private

292
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,359
companies we really multi-restrain but

293
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,000
we structure and really focus on seed

294
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,759
stage series a series b getting those

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,679
little baby unicorns catching them

296
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,200
feeding them taking care of them and

297
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,958
then getting them ready for like future

298
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
exits or acquisitions which has been a

299
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,919
big strategy but like i said in the

300
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,599
united states irc 280 this tax code from

301
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,958
1982

302
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
like you normally know your cost of

303
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,000
goods sold for that what your deductions

304
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,480
are appreciation a little thing no one

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
understands is this thing called ebitda

306
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
you know maybe some of you have heard of

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
it you know based on your backgrounds of

308
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,639
course campus operators did not so an

309
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,200
imc 280 when you cannot deduct your

310
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,600
normal cost of goods sold you can claim

311
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
your depreciation you can't insulate

312
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,639
assets you can't deduct your interest

313
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,959
expense nor your tax expense you're like

314
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,838
net at the end of the day might be 30 to

315
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,518
40 percent less than a normal business

316
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,320
now the thing that's crazy

317
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
irc 280 is only applicable in the united

318
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
states

319
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,600
and it's only applicable to companies

320
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,000
that deal in the unregulated controlled

321
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,839
manufacturing distribution of schedule

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,839
one and schedule

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
two narcotics

324
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,360
remember that whole thing i said about

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
the u.n how we rescheduled that the

326
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
united states were members of the united

327
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,959
nations

328
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,039
we're in violation of u.n drug treaties

329
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,719
which we actually pushed like

330
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,240
to write back in the day to like really

331
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
kick him in half

332
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,480
to go against that so we're actually in

333
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
violation of that policy the moment that

334
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,639
the international air house control

335
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,559
board and the cnd wh

336
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,000
which we were members of until like that

337
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,919
last president which we don't want to

338
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,360
talk about um so i didn't believe the

339
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:40,159
wheel during the global pandemic

340
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,919
that's maybe why this didn't happen but

341
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,600
the moment the united states starts to

342
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,399
follow u.n drug treaties irc 280 e goes

343
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
away

344
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,879
it's not the care act more act it's not

345
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,799
schumer's bill it's kind of like oh no

346
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,159
institutional capital banking can come

347
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,639
into the states

348
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,759
when we follow that accuracy 280 out the

349
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,039
window companies now for their ebitda

350
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,838
taxes interest expense appreciation

351
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,559
cost of goods sold deductions we get it

352
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,760
that's literally the silver bullet to

353
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,559
companies in the united states

354
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:16,480
especially the ms espresso truly

355
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,078
purely harvest on like forefront

356
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,839
that's when if you're in those and that

357
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,359
happens you're going to see a bump not

358
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,040
giving them securities advice here but

359
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
you're going to see a bump in like

360
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,360
30 40 50 on their stop by pretty much

361
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,278
day one to that

362
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,039
so just watch and know that that's a

363
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,799
very significant day

364
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,759
now in the united states you know where

365
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,599
i'm from

366
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,519
up there by canada that gray one up at

367
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,959
the top and sorry i realized actually

368
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,278
this one i forgot to change it at the

369
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,879
end we also have virginia on there now

370
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,720
mississippi happened for medical but

371
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,078
their supreme court said like oh the

372
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,959
voters didn't understand what they're

373
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,879
willing for or stopped like voters don't

374
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,638
know where to stop that and then south

375
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,720
dakota actually passed medical and

376
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,720
recreational in the same boat but then

377
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,480
their governor is kind of

378
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,959
kind of like the governor of maine used

379
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
to be and didn't allow that to happen so

380
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,958
when you look at this patchwork from

381
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,360
when it was like california in 1996 with

382
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,319
the compassionate usap first medical

383
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,320
cannabis

384
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
compassionate use act in the united

385
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,320
states they didn't allow commercial

386
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,079
sales it was like i'm a non-profit i

387
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,560
build plans for people i sell plants

388
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,239
with people but we don't make any money

389
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,958
colorado is the first when you think

390
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,720
about what's happening

391
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,119
only a matter of time

392
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,480
and you know texas giant place it has a

393
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,078
medical program but only for the

394
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,000
childhood epilepsy

395
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,759
so this is really where to watch

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
companies and grants that start we have

397
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,838
a very illicit medical market

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
all those medical states originally we

399
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
call them the dirty seven california

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,879
oregon washington

401
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,880
um

402
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,320
michigan maine

403
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,159
they had a medical program where you

404
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,320
could have like this piece of a drop on

405
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,240
the wall it's like i can have 90 plants

406
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
for jamie and nine plants for thelma and

407
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,919
90 plants for steve

408
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
we're not selling it of course but then

409
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,360
you have states like oklahoma in a way

410
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,319
that are growing copious amounts of

411
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
cannabis

412
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,120
and it's kind of like leaving those

413
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,879
states now a big thing um under

414
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,360
president trump passed president trump

415
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,439
thank goodness um

416
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,879
he put in uh jeff sessions that's the

417
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,720
attorney general that little keebler

418
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,958
alphabet guy

419
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,959
got

420
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,440
he was like hey there's this thing from

421
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,599
james cole you know past you know he's

422
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
like this whole memorandum had eight

423
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
rules that states had to follow in order

424
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,240
to have a legal medical cannabis program

425
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,759
and he's like this doesn't matter

426
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,198
so pretty much that's the only guy who's

427
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,240
getting followed and then he said it was

428
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:37,838
garbage

429
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,000
so when that happened it's like let's go

430
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,160
follow that because what's gonna happen

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,720
it's that fear that's the moment of

432
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,480
opportunity we are we are definitely too

433
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,560
big to fail this isn't like are people

434
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,920
going to buy shoes online i don't know

435
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,599
those apples might not be a good

436
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,439
investment uber who's going to use that

437
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,079
there's taxi cabs

438
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,519
cannabis is already a bona fide market

439
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,638
and the united states doesn't want you

440
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,519
to know this

441
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,120
nor the dea which has a beautiful logo

442
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
like that flying eagle but like the drug

443
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,269
enforcement administration

444
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
sorry guys

445
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,600
[Music]

446
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,600
our elicit market in the united states

447
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,839
is close to 200 billion dollars

448
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
200 billion they say it's about 50. they

449
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,800
don't want you to know this from

450
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,000
thumbnail a lot more people use canvas

451
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,679
than actually admit on their little

452
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,958
surveys let's just say on government

453
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,039
survey are you going to admit to like

454
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,879
breaking feather law probably not

455
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,039
but this is really rare to watch and

456
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,559
there's major things happening now also

457
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,919
with these new states that are coming

458
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,439
with like so connecticut actually

459
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,759
already happened

460
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,800
good to go on that new medical states

461
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,919
like alabama south dakota did happen

462
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,159
it's only a matter of time in the united

463
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,519
states until this happens and we were

464
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,600
the that made this kind of

465
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,679
illegal all over the world back from

466
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,320
william randolph first you read that

467
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,479
book the emperor wears some clothes jack

468
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,040
herrera back in the day this was nothing

469
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,519
to do with like smoking cannabis it was

470
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,519
all about like paper industry cotton

471
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,480
industry petrochemical industries being

472
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,000
like

473
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,759
we don't know the forests and the

474
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,440
paper mills and it's like way better

475
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,278
than all our

476
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,040
we should like make that sound bad so

477
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,879
then they use their journalism yellow

478
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,278
journalism to like write about like

479
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,600
reefer madness african americans raping

480
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,879
white women like devils lettuce scary

481
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,720
stuff

482
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,480
just to really make propaganda about

483
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,600
cannabis and we did that and now it's

484
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,480
kind of weird that we're going to be the

485
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,759
first ones to like make 100 billion a

486
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
year

487
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,680
from this industry so

488
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,399
sorry about all that but i'm working on

489
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,399
making that better now but every

490
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,958
every day especially based on corona

491
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,240
virus states lost so much tax revenue

492
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,319
and jobs

493
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,680
they don't care about cannabis anymore

494
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,000
they're like hey

495
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,679
george floyd like all the things that

496
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,320
happened this last year like social

497
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,799
equity minorities united states alone

498
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
there's over 1 million african americans

499
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,399
or latinos that go to like private

500
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,680
prisons every year for minor cannabis

501
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,759
offenses

502
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,359
and the private prison industry is also

503
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,199
one of the biggest lobbyists against

504
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,439
legalization in the united states

505
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,359
because that's their revenue which is an

506
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,360
absolute way to make revenue and i'm a

507
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,198
big triple bottom line for people of

508
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,798
planet profit you steal from the

509
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,199
environment or you steal from people

510
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,759
your profit is not generally it's not

511
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,360
genuine it's a bandana principle

512
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,959
and when you think about like what

513
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,198
profitability is possible in this

514
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,400
industry especially in the united states

515
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,240
epic now foreign nationals don't invest

516
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,480
into something federally illegal in

517
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,200
another country kind of bad idea

518
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,960
homeland security not a good idea

519
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,160
ancillary which we'll get into is a huge

520
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,279
opportunity

521
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,759
now

522
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,440
here we go there you go so i was making

523
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,599
fun of canada before yes they were the

524
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,600
first on like a national medical program

525
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,599
other than uruguay that you're ways down

526
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,359
like little anybody don't care even

527
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,798
though in the beginning we were really

528
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,159
terrified the new international

529
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,558
narcotics community board was going to

530
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,640
like cramp down on uruguay same thing

531
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,720
for their adult use program we watched

532
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,960
nothing happen then you have a g8

533
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,038
country like canada be like legal good

534
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,720
medical we send it in the mail

535
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,279
we like poutine

536
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,558
good and then they legalized adult use

537
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,558
and then we're like

538
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,720
is this are they going to go after

539
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,200
a g nothing happened

540
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,558
so i feel like we're pretty good trudeau

541
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
and everyone knows like we're pretty

542
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,639
good now especially since they've

543
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,079
already raised about 300 billion dollars

544
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
for some of those other companies and

545
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,000
more more that's undisclosed and private

546
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,519
but all those public companies was like

547
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,279
this is going to happen and it didn't

548
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,279
and i started calling on these crashes

549
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,879
very very early and everyone thought it

550
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,279
was freaking crazy

551
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,640
i love private companies that scale and

552
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:42,079
grow mergers acquisitions ipos normal

553
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,840
business dot com awesome but that bubble

554
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,159
burst because so many of them were

555
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,359
garbage companies the same with those

556
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,480
bubbles for

557
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,159
they're like we're going to grow

558
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,400
cannabis for the whole world because

559
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,759
we're the first ones to do it canada is

560
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,280
cold as

561
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,839
it's not where you want to have massive

562
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,480
greenhouses i've been buying greenhouses

563
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,798
in canada really fancy dutch ones

564
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,558
disassembling them bringing them across

565
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,119
the united states order and reassembling

566
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,720
them for literally less than 10 cents

567
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,079
when they started to close these things

568
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,360
it was like

569
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,720
maybe we're not going to supply the

570
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,000
world because our cost of production is

571
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,000
so high

572
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,599
and right now there's almost 800

573
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,160
companies in canada through health

574
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,439
canada you get your lpa original license

575
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,200
and then you have to build your whole

576
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,279
facility have an

577
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
then get your final approval license

578
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,918
there's 800 companies currently building

579
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,000
out more facilities in canada to like

580
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,200
make water just to put more water in the

581
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
ocean

582
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,558
like they don't need more cannabis

583
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,440
there's such an oversupply of cannabis

584
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:43,119
whenever year supply storages in canada

585
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,240
all lies also any public company press

586
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,000
release you read from canada 97 chance

587
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,440
it's pure

588
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,319
or actually they don't study about the

589
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
company

590
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,879
like this may

591
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,158
it was when they signed in

592
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,400
for a meeting

593
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,640
did a big press release stopping up 113

594
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
million dollars in market share in a

595
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,400
day

596
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,678
from signing in to have a meeting about

597
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,440
nothing

598
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,640
so just know that that's not the case

599
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
i've been trying to put in your own

600
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,759
business for years because like our

601
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
lighting company the sun i always say

602
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,038
this like it's the best lighting company

603
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,918
in the world i've been growing plants

604
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,879
for over a half a billion years biology

605
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,440
enemies

606
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,240
like the sun outdoor four season hybrid

607
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,080
greenhouse that's the way the future

608
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,079
indoor we only did it to go inside

609
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,599
behind so like if you're investing in

610
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,720
the massive like

611
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,879
you know

612
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,960
50 000 hectare indoor facilities your

613
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
constant reduction on a cabinet

614
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,880
standpoint it's about six times what a

615
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
greenhouse is and your opex is about six

616
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,919
times as well paying for electricity and

617
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,640
hvac dehumidification so humidor is good

618
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,840
for r d smaller scale not for growing

619
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,280
all the pineapples for the

620
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,639
world now you always want to think about

621
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,079
these things from a normal business

622
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,038
standpoint like what are the

623
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,720
profitability kpis for

624
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,400
whatever it is you're investing just

625
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,079
because it's a cannabis thing doesn't

626
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,600
mean it's going to be a good investment

627
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,798
in 2014 15 16 we can't it's great that's

628
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,798
not the only thing in the world that

629
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,759
matters anymore so you really have to

630
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,038
think about like what are their

631
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,640
standards

632
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,440
too many people say this is so divine

633
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,200
but like we are a compliance industry

634
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,038
and if we are a good plan we have the

635
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,038
privilege of cultivating manufacturing

636
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,200
and distributing controlled substances

637
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,919
if it's not compliant at high level

638
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,919
standards it's not bona fide in my mind

639
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
and i won't touch it there's a risk

640
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,960
factor for our investors even with

641
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,880
anything bad going on out even if it is

642
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,038
a potential uniform it's a unicorn it's

643
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
going to break its leg and die

644
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,879
so always look at those other sorts of

645
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,960
people and like what are the metrics of

646
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,120
this company true financial models

647
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,640
audited financial models so many

648
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,839
companies raising camp don't even know

649
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,080
what that is

650
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,240
so make sure to like evaluate cannabis

651
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,319
just like any other business opportunity

652
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,319
if you're new to this industry we've

653
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,839
done this for 15 years i've been looking

654
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,279
to say garbage and you're like i already

655
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,279
put 5 million

656
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,639
that was probably a bad idea

657
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,960
and like what can you do to get your

658
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
money have a change over uh it's just

659
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,319
improved

660
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,960
so another kind of big thing you know

661
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,639
with ham and cannabis there's like thc

662
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,519
which is actually kca that's the

663
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,200
psychological side there's over 260

664
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,038
known cannabinoids from like what dr

665
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,080
machine originally found out back in the

666
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,599
60s in israel

667
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,960
now there's this big one delta eight

668
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,000
right now that everyone's talking about

669
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,000
it gets you kind of up

670
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,440
accidentally had a delta eight candy in

671
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,279
north carolina last week at this

672
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,880
conference i was at they were just

673
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,079
giving away this like little goodie bag

674
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
they weren't labeled

675
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,158
i was like oh taffy i'm like sitting up

676
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,960
that night i'd probably eat five pounds

677
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,960
of food like two and a half

678
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:13,599
cdg that was cool

679
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,039
in 2016. if you're a cbd company now i

680
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,719
don't care

681
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,960
realistically i mean unless you're

682
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,839
getting your supply from a gmp producer

683
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,079
in romania poland colombia and other

684
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,639
states like if you're producing cbd in

685
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,480
california i probably don't care

686
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
or like you're some new novel safety

687
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,798
company the biggest snake oil industry

688
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,200
we've ever seen but it's also an amazing

689
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,519
disconnect that needs more research but

690
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,880
so many garbage companies got into it

691
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,599
and now so delta a is going to be

692
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,200
scheduled like that cdn just look and

693
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,038
bet these things just because it's novel

694
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,558
doesn't mean it's going to be epic now

695
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,679
in europe you've got some massive

696
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,200
opportunities here but not so much yet

697
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,679
we qualified for some of those german

698
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,240
tankers early on when they took that 2

699
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
200 kilo block away which was like i'm

700
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,240
like we got a license in germany and

701
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,480
then like to literally grow in a space

702
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,880
this big i feel like that was a bad idea

703
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,880
the beef i'd love to stop that like that

704
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,360
and now there's the new program too

705
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,520
profitable i mean i don't say german so

706
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,798
if i get your voyage like that last part

707
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,158
it's going to be good but cannabis

708
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,278
produced in germany would be so

709
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,000
expensive

710
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,200
compared to like portugal or some of

711
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,038
these other countries that we've worked

712
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,880
in now yeah greece is part of the

713
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,079
european union no offense greece i don't

714
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,159
know how they're part of the european

715
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,879
union

716
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,320
but

717
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,480
like greece was going to do this huge

718
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,839
thing they copied israeli laws which

719
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,000
meant that everything had to have a

720
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,319
standard deviation of zero

721
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
to be exported so like there are a lot

722
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,599
of opportunities there but you really

723
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,440
have to vet these countries just because

724
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,278
it's north macedonia and you've got this

725
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,600
new cool thing that you can do

726
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,880
doesn't mean it's going to mean eu gmt

727
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,399
standards

728
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,679
i just have to say one quick thing we're

729
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,038
not going to take a break after this

730
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,798
we're going to make up for time to go

731
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,558
right into the next panel and then we've

732
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,158
got a big great lunch for everybody

733
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,599
right after that you know i'll keep

734
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,600
rocking and trying to swear a little bit

735
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,558
so you know we won two of the eleven

736
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,839
licenses in denmark originally we've got

737
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,918
the first license and portion of the

738
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,158
workforce some of those in germany like

739
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,799
massive opportunities here in europe but

740
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,400
still it's so early and everything

741
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,038
international you have to remember it's

742
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,919
under compassionate use and that takes a

743
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,599
doctor to write a prescription

744
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,320
medical in the united states doctors

745
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,639
make recommendations not prescriptions

746
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,798
prescriptions are around the fda

747
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,559
which is federally illegal so they can't

748
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,359
write prescriptions other than for like

749
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:38,079
a few cannabis products like from gm

750
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,558
students which is now like worth like

751
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:43,918
for a very crowded 2.5 2.5 it doesn't

752
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,918
make any sense but they were first

753
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,278
this is a really important thing for any

754
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,879
international investors to understand

755
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,880
pace countries p-i-c-s

756
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,840
these blue ones are the only countries

757
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,240
that freaking matter if you want to

758
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,359
develop phased clinical trials or drugs

759
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,440
that are going to be able to be sold in

760
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,558
the united states and europe you're like

761
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,240
oh i have this cool license in zimbabwe

762
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,839
and we're going to make cancer our

763
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,240
products for cancer we sell all the

764
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,759
world no you're not if it's not produced

765
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,319
in a pig's country or your clinical

766
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,759
trials are dominant country it will not

767
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,839
meet those standards and you will have

768
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,640
to redo them all somewhere else

769
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:24,639
time is everything these things can take

770
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,759
up to 11 years and cost 562 million

771
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
euros

772
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,359
just to get a product to market

773
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,000
pharmaceutically so whenever people

774
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,038
start talking about pharma just know

775
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,599
money

776
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,440
big companies and it's not about trying

777
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,119
to be fizer it's about trying to be

778
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,798
bought by flies

779
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,719
so like you have to think in that kind

780
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,599
of capacity so when you think about this

781
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,919
map on top of where is production lab is

782
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,240
not unfortunately the biggest partners

783
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,159
like argentina and that's why i love

784
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,679
south africa and got licenses there

785
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,840
that's why cambodia even though it's

786
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,440
freaking crazy with thailand i'm

787
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,678
interested in that because it's a pixed

788
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,840
country long term same portugal the only

789
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,798
country in europe that has the most epic

790
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,798
climate

791
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,798
cheapest cost of labor

792
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,798
surfing

793
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,240
so if you're ever thinking about this

794
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
like clinical recently if you're

795
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,599
investing into pharmaceutical companies

796
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,119
it's not the cannabis companies right

797
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,119
now it's going to be their options on

798
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,639
these things and what's really important

799
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,398
as you go through this is know that it's

800
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,640
going to cost a lot of money and take

801
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:32,319
way more time

802
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,159
the ip of cannabis can be everything

803
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,918
it's not illegal to own the intellectual

804
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,000
property to do something

805
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,520
it's illegal to do the thing but owning

806
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,440
the intellectual property can be the

807
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,119
biggest value because that's what's

808
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,000
going to be bought by dupont and

809
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,319
monsanto and pfizer and modern and all

810
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,759
of these companies nature so you must

811
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,759
protect that intellectual property

812
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,278
through the right structures

813
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,558
latin america is definitely going to be

814
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,960
a world leader when you think about

815
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,119
colombia specifically i love how

816
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,759
the pastor of moore in colombia and now

817
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,839
like i put a plank outside flowers it's

818
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,240
12 hours of dark 12 hours of light big

819
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,678
three ounces get plants ready put them

820
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,839
inside boom

821
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,519
massive oil plantations columbia

822
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,038
literally could serve the entire world's

823
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,679
cannabis

824
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,480
and they just allow

825
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,880
export this last month which is huge

826
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,798
before it was just oil evaluations in

827
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,399
columbia are going to be great over 100

828
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,000
licenses

829
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,678
only seven of them

830
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,679
and i know three owners of companies

831
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,319
going to be a little weird that peru can

832
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,679
also change the world because it's so

833
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,359
close to the equator when you think

834
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,399
about where canvas is going to be grown

835
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,639
long-term

836
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,479
it's the waistline of the world

837
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,000
and the further away you are the more

838
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,278
expensive it's going to be to do it and

839
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,558
the more environmentally kind you're

840
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,640
responsible

841
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,720
asia has kind of been a big a bit crazy

842
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,799
with us china is great on the hemp side

843
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,200
about things that are kind of huge when

844
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,119
you think about cambodian passing

845
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,720
thailand through university

846
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,839
and their programs and what that's going

847
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,079
to be like

848
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,839
um kind of major philippines they used

849
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,038
to murder you from cannabis now we

850
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,639
should talk to

851
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,640
um

852
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,919
big big deal everything in africa is

853
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,200
mostly garbage

854
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,520
mine is hosutu and mine is south africa

855
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,360
if you know the king swaziland and he's

856
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,319
going to give you some exclusive license

857
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,519
to do something you're probably not

858
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,960
now there's gonna be some massive

859
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,879
opportunities not to on the whole

860
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,880
continent but like in south africa

861
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,880
they're like so this is africa

862
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,919
very interesting place to do business

863
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,278
and you're gonna have to deal with the

864
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,120
chinese when it comes to real estate

865
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,038
typically but their climates are good in

866
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,479
south africa you can get if you're doing

867
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,398
stuff in the northern hemisphere and

868
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,360
down here you're getting two harvests a

869
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,199
year massively actually four but just

870
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,359
know that a lot of things in africa are

871
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
very volatile and the exports can be a

872
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,558
problem

873
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,960
oceana the thing i put up here really

874
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,240
sad you know with rona like adult use

875
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,480
didn't pass

876
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,919
in new zealand which was really sad by

877
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
just a few votes

878
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,320
um

879
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,000
that was going to be a big change for us

880
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,158
but guam i've got the first i got the

881
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,398
first medical license on guam

882
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,720
there's 1.6 billion people that live

883
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,959
within a four hour flight long

884
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,399
so brands for recreational to be legal

885
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,240
there now which is starting with our

886
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,479
first companies that's where we can

887
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,960
start brands in korean and russian and

888
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,440
japanese and chinese and actually start

889
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,120
exposing tourists to dolphins for the

890
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,120
first time if you've ever played that

891
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,959
risk game this is how you get into

892
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,278
africa this is how you get into those

893
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,278
seven troops

894
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,159
ancillary is huge for you investors

895
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,359
foreign nationals i make 12

896
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,720
to 18

897
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,678
on real estate

898
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,679
i say that again i mean 12 to 18 on real

899
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,240
estate secured by

900
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,240
a fixed asset because the institutional

901
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,000
capital cannot give loans to companies

902
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
to build their greenhouses by their land

903
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,159
by their extraction equipment you can

904
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,679
invest into those things and debt is not

905
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,159
a financial interest it must be

906
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,759
disclosed and you can do that in a bona

907
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,000
fide way in the united states or other

908
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,839
countries so ancillary from all these

909
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,640
sorts of things just remember for every

910
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,398
dollar spent on a cannabis product the

911
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,840
velocity of capital in cannabis is

912
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,319
anywhere between four and six

913
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:20,558
dollars just think the united states if

914
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:23,278
we did 30 billion in revenue this year

915
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,359
that means there's 120 billion of this

916
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,398
going on and this is not federally

917
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,759
illegal it's structured

918
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,439
so when you're thinking about what's

919
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,038
going on in the future here that

920
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,200
opportunities well

921
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,000
know from people like what's real what's

922
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,600
not what can you do what can you not

923
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
do investment due diligence tech

924
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,959
services i had printed off a lot of

925
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,798
these things in the back for specific

926
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,200
for investors like what things to do

927
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,918
that deals and opportunities

928
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,840
look out seek advice all confidentially

929
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,440
basically is this a good idea or not is

930
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,639
this evaluation

931
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,278
or not because if you don't even like

932
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,960
deloitte even big big companies they

933
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:02,319
don't understand cannabis in the way

934
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,399
that the people who have been in the

935
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,278
trenches bleeding for a couple decades

936
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,879
happening

937
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,240
things look different when you've like

938
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,159
been in battle and you come back and

939
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,679
you're like whoa war is kind of crazy

940
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,200
and you're like war is great we're going

941
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,120
in you know

942
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
like run the front of the line so really

943
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,719
do your homework a lot of good people

944
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,240
here even though you might look left and

945
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,558
right you think like normal investment

946
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,558
these are my competitors no

947
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,918
in human history when we collaborate we

948
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,839
win

949
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,360
so like the collaboration i put five

950
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,038
million towards something you put five

951
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,599
in like the more that we pool capital

952
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,839
with your funds special purpose vehicles

953
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,918
and wise investment managers you don't

954
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,759
have to be an expert overnight so like

955
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
look around and make partnerships so

956
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,200
great that we get to be back together i

957
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,119
know it's been a long time since uh we

958
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,480
were able to do this again if you've got

959
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,719
any questions you know we'll be here

960
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,120
this next couple days such a big thanks

961
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,720
to alice in the icbc this is this

962
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,759
conference has literally changed the

963
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,278
world

964
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,119
and from a medical like disabled

965
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,558
veterans standpoint like getting

966
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,719
medicine to patients is our highest

967
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,398
priority and doing this in a responsible

968
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,000
way without conferences like this that

969
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,479
have been in the trenches themselves for

970
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,480
years allowing things to happen that we

971
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,519
talk about that are illegal in many

972
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,919
places

973
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,440
it's those risk takers that that really

974
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,120
the pioneers that made this industry

975
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,798
possible we've got a lot of experts here

976
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,079
from the united states from other

977
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,918
countries so if you've got questions

978
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,000
we're here we just want to like rise and

979
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,278
