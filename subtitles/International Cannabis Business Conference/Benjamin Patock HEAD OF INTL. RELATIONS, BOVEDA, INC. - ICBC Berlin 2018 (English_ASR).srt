1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:08,940
the second-biggest online cigar retailer

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,759
in Germany and now he is taking his

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,469
knowledge into the cannabis world as the

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,928
head of international relations for

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,880
Bovada the global leader in two-way

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:29,518
humidity control please give a warm

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:32,399
welcome to mr. Benjamin potluck hello

8
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:36,299
everybody thank you thank you for having

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,370
me here cannot before we start can i

10
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,428
maybe get used for a quick survey who of

11
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:44,878
you actually knows or uses but without

12
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,620
by any chance okay okay

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,259
quite a few people but lots of potential

14
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:52,798
which I love a lot you know giving the

15
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,599
specs of this talk but we are basically

16
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:57,569
only one thing but this we do to

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,489
perfection we would regulate the inside

18
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:03,389
the humidity on the inside of any given

19
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:05,489
you know container to a constant level

20
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,590
of humidity and we do this for a myriad

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,649
of use cases cannabis be an obvious one

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,140
otherwise we would not be here today but

23
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:15,780
we also do it for tobacco hence you know

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,739
the the once right back

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,679
sorry go one slide back the the title of

26
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,118
my talk today so we are basically only

27
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:25,769
have one product and you see it right

28
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,509
there so it's that little pouch we have

29
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,390
it in different sizes and different RH

30
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,769
levels for a myriad of cases as I said

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:36,450
we also do it for medicinal no musical

32
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:41,069
instrument sorry musical instruments

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,379
just as guitars violins because you know

34
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,478
they made out of wood so no wood is

35
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,149
exposed to changing humidity levels they

36
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,789
would expand or contract and you don't

37
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,618
want that we also do it for medical

38
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,179
devices actually go inside of the human

39
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:56,578
body yes so you see we have a product

40
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:58,950
that it's actually very reliable and

41
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,688
very safe and at the same time

42
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,100
inexpensive because we have the very

43
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,538
modest goal of being present we have a

44
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,938
flowers present so we want to work with

45
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:08,340
multinationals at the same time as we do

46
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,859
want to work with consumers around the

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,750
globe here are some of the companies

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,280
that we do work with some of which you

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,419
probably know

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,860
some of which are here today even so we

51
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,979
rewrite there we're in the industry for

52
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,030
over 20 years in it sorry we're around

53
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,509
for over 20 years in the cannabis

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,189
industry for roughly 11 years about me I

55
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,979
joined the company that long ago I was

56
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,419
in the as I was presented in the premium

57
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,929
cigar industry before I founded a

58
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:39,449
company I looked back to a career of an

59
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,540
entrepreneur like 12 plus years so the

60
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:44,310
last one was was a good one now one of

61
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,879
the biggest online retailers for premium

62
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,280
tobacco and cigars and I want to talk a

63
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,990
little bit about maybe the similarities

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,090
of the industries I know that the

65
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,810
products themselves they cannot be

66
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,490
compared okay so tobacco did a lot of

67
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,259
terrible things to a lot of people

68
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,270
around the globe when we talk about

69
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,729
cigars it's a little bit different

70
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,469
though because cigars it's still tobacco

71
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,269
and still not good for you so if you

72
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,039
consider if you have problems with your

73
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,870
health or you do want to lead a health

74
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,539
less so you should not smoke at all you

75
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,770
know that's that's given but cigars are

76
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,019
really like a lifestyle product you

77
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,469
don't really see people standing outside

78
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,120
in the rain you know freezing smoking a

79
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,620
big church or you know for two and a

80
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,259
half hours you know because they're

81
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,180
addicted to two cigar smoking it's

82
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,359
something that you do choose to do

83
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,760
because you enjoy it it's a luxury item

84
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,500
that you choose to consume you know

85
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,849
either alone or with a circle of friends

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,169
with the luxury of the time that it

87
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:45,389
needs to be you know consumed yet it's

88
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,099
undoubtedly that this plant has magical

89
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,689
powers and that's why we all here right

90
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,340
so I don't want to talk about the

91
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,680
differences in there in the in the

92
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,569
product per se but how the product is

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,969
being treated by the stakeholders that

94
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,829
are in the marketplace and there are

95
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,239
indeed a lot of similarities said I have

96
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,969
you know and a lot of challenges that I

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,519
have been bouncing on and off and in my

98
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:08,340
last career and that I see that could be

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,009
very well possible in in Europe going

100
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,069
forward to full legalization like full

101
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,810
recreational usage full adult usage and

102
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,358
I would just want to talk about a bunch

103
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,290
of them and one is regulations because

104
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,238
there's one thing there's not many

105
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,650
things and you can be sure of but one

106
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,829
thing that you have to be sure if I said

107
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:27,609
regulators they will be lazy enough not

108
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:29,500
to come up with a unique ID

109
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,240
year of how to treat recreational

110
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,500
cannabis over here they will look left

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,930
and right to other highly regulated

112
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,240
industries and we'll see what they can

113
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,400
take out of there and you will then look

114
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,689
into tobacco a look into alcohol knowing

115
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,878
that in Germany I mean we're probably

116
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:44,199
someone who loses alcohol regulations

117
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,750
that there are in Western in a

118
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,699
westernized world but tobacco you know

119
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,899
you can bump into a couple of things and

120
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,050
I just give you a quick rundown

121
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:54,818
you know advertising you're not allowed

122
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,129
to advertise tobacco products at all

123
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:01,569
unless they're in the tobacco property

124
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:04,750
or in a retail you know store storefront

125
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,610
pretty much and this can be this could

126
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,839
be very much a reality for cannabis

127
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,848
products too even though they're fully

128
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,468
legal you know they still have the

129
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:13,990
stigma a little bit attached to it so

130
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:16,389
it's it's a very good possibility that

131
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,370
you not be allowed even though it's we

132
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,468
we talk in the future here even though

133
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,848
it's 100% legal you might not be allowed

134
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:23,468
to advertise your product and you have

135
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:26,370
to incorporate that into your strategy

136
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:29,829
obviously when you're coming from abroad

137
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,629
so backup products in Germany have a

138
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,908
fixed price that means it doesn't matter

139
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,009
if you buy expensive cigar a cheap cigar

140
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:38,740
even at a gas station or the super high

141
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:40,210
retail outlet high-end retail outlet

142
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,400
they're gonna have the same price

143
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:43,658
everywhere and this is because the way

144
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,658
of tobacco products how they're being

145
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:49,028
taxed in Germany they're taxed on the

146
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:53,740
final retail value towards the consumer

147
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:55,468
so if this price would be changing you

148
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,689
know then it would be like a whole mess

149
00:05:55,468 --> 00:06:00,668
in in the administration and the way you

150
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,800
you actually pay the taxes is you would

151
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:04,628
go to a government agency and buy tax

152
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,310
stamps upfront so you give all the money

153
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,870
that you have to pay on taxes up front

154
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,459
to the government and take a little

155
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,769
stamps and put them onto the boxes and

156
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,778
dannielle out to sell it is that an open

157
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:15,609
is that a possible outcome for cannabis

158
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:17,649
could be we don't know but this is this

159
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,028
is what it's happening to millions and

160
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:23,438
billions of tobacco products all over

161
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:26,468
the European Union every day miners of

162
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,330
course you know H is an issue with

163
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:29,468
tobacco and for good reasons and with

164
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:32,528
cannabis is going to be the same no

165
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:33,939
doubt about it for for instance one

166
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:37,028
thing that you have to keep in mind if

167
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:39,699
if there's going to be ecommerce for

168
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:41,408
cannabis products what we have now in

169
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,598
place in the European units like a2

170
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:45,579
tah verification system for tobacco

171
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,009
products it means that th has to be

172
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:50,649
verified a before you complete the

173
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,389
purchase online and secondly upon

174
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:56,678
delivery of the product of the product

175
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:58,119
itself so there's a two-tier step TBD to

176
00:06:56,678 --> 00:07:00,579
stands for tobacco product directive

177
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:02,110
number two it's a stupid word for

178
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:03,848
something that considers all the

179
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,528
packaging that you see well if you

180
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:07,300
didn't look at cigarette packs you have

181
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:09,308
this nice shocking images that we have

182
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,199
right now I don't know if you have the

183
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:12,939
same everywhere around the globe it's

184
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,718
kind of we only have them for a couple

185
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:20,019
of years here but it really comes down

186
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:22,178
also on how to how you what you allow to

187
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,829
name your product how to describe a

188
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:26,378
product because they forbid anything

189
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:28,629
that's related with food when it comes

190
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,489
to tobacco so we have a we work with a

191
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:34,239
company named nectar of the United

192
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:36,488
States and if they wanted to add like SF

193
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:38,468
now come up with a tobacco Progress name

194
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:40,628
nectar they would not be allowed to do

195
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:42,550
it even though they have the brand

196
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,439
registered globally it's just because

197
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,929
it's a food term and it even goes to

198
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,550
such lengths as if you have a like a

199
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:50,799
pipe tobacco that's flavored with

200
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,569
vanilla you not be allowed to say that

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,550
word vanilla on the packaging even

202
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,289
though it has vanilla in it but it's a

203
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,499
food related term so you will not be

204
00:07:56,288 --> 00:08:01,149
allowed to do it and typically to is

205
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,919
only beginning the next step is going to

206
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,928
happen to the tobacco industry is

207
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,240
they're gonna have a full track and

208
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:09,158
trace with every tobacco product because

209
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,809
they want to dry out the the grain

210
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,509
market coming from other European

211
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:15,189
countries on and even abroad so every

212
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:17,199
single tobacco product has to be

213
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:22,389
completely traceable along the along the

214
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,919
process of the value chain so yeah so

215
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:24,939
you better get your legal team ready and

216
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,508
even though it's going to be tough to

217
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:31,169
say which of the regulations will be you

218
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:36,099
know also facing the cannabis industry

219
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:38,078
it's if the youth see something in like

220
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,120
like neighbor and industries that you

221
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:42,158
don't like you have to do lobbying work

222
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,629
against it now because once it is in

223
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,269
writing it's going to be very hard to

224
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:48,129
fight it the second thing I want to talk

225
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,019
about a little bit the stigma of the

226
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:52,000
industry because all the cigar smokers

227
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:53,558
are now I'm it's I get the same thing

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,089
when I tell people that I'm in a cigar

229
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:56,289
industry they're all like you

230
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,540
you don't look like somebody who smoked

231
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:00,248
cigars it's like okay so why is that

232
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,769
because they have an image in their head

233
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:05,170
of Gordon Gekko type of business tycoon

234
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:07,299
or the other picture is my granddad he

235
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,009
used to smoke cigars and of course with

236
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:11,289
cannabis it's the same you know all

237
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,879
users are a bunch of stoners even though

238
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:14,169
I see Tommy Chong's brand up there so

239
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,569
it's free awesome so stoners get

240
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,188
business people at some time or that

241
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:20,169
drug addicts right this is this is like

242
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:21,519
the stigma is like my my dad when I told

243
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:23,169
him that I'm going to a cannabis event

244
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,948
he's like oh that's okay as long as you

245
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:28,539
don't start smoking it and it's like mmm

246
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:29,979
and I'm not immune to this you know I'm

247
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:31,269
not immune to this I remember my first

248
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,490
kind of this show I was like well they

249
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,318
have kids here but if this had been a

250
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,850
wine event like a Wine Festival took

251
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:38,889
really normal to bring your family right

252
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,709
so it's so this is this is what I mean

253
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:44,289
with that obviously once you go down the

254
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:46,299
road of full legalization you get the

255
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:47,948
vast variety of products are coming in

256
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,479
and and that's it means that you're

257
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:51,159
gonna have to build a brand because all

258
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,170
the tobacco products that we have in the

259
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,808
market right now in Europe and around

260
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:57,278
the globe they're not so byproducts good

261
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:59,499
quality it is because the quality

262
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,649
quality is really hard to assess for a

263
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:04,360
consumer it is really hard and I always

264
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,698
say well if you go to like like wine

265
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,678
tastings like 65% of what is talked

266
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:10,628
there is just pure [ __ ] well again

267
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:13,470
tobacco industry is like 95% and

268
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:16,959
cannabis is somewhere in between so

269
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,660
brand is is that what will differentiate

270
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,159
you will sell your product not about the

271
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,688
product quality because people will have

272
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,278
a binary decision about it they like it

273
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,928
or they don't like it they like it maybe

274
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:27,879
better it works for them and it helps

275
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:29,198
them or it doesn't help them it helps

276
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,670
better than another product so it's

277
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:34,120
always like a binary decision that

278
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:35,620
that's awell Fitness and the brand is

279
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,058
actually the cognitive anchor that helps

280
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,459
you know transporting it so they're

281
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:41,110
going to buy something because they like

282
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,609
this story do we go select design

283
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,769
because they're like the persona that

284
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,269
represents that brand and this is

285
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,860
something we use when we brought new

286
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:51,100
tobacco products new cigars into the

287
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:54,459
market for for positioning you know it's

288
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,558
just just an example but when we talk

289
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:59,128
about product quality obviously let's we

290
00:10:56,558 --> 00:11:01,480
should take a step back because quality

291
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:03,670
when we look at any definition always

292
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,019
says that it's measured one is one thing

293
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:07,568
as a measure to get something else and

294
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,629
what we measure is our expectations

295
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:10,779
we're just

296
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:13,070
we perceive of that product or service

297
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,779
so that's the thing that's first of all

298
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,950
what is important is it's never constant

299
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,870
because it's you know perception

300
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,520
expectations they will change and they

301
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,899
can't even change from something you

302
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,850
don't even have in the ream of your own

303
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,350
control so it can be that you have a

304
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,149
perfectly good quality product but

305
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,529
you're competitive competition raises

306
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:31,939
quality all of a sudden your product is

307
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:33,470
just good or okay so you have to you

308
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,030
have to work with us and qualities it's

309
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,639
like the beginning of everything of all

310
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,959
the of the and the entire loyalty value

311
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,419
chain if you want to put it this way

312
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,610
because if you take the your perceived

313
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:45,349
quality measured against the cost of

314
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,399
attaining a product or service you will

315
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,009
come up with something that's called

316
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,110
value if you if you value the perceived

317
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,600
value is higher or equal to what you

318
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,830
expected you'll be satisfied if not

319
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,210
you're not going to be satisfied if you

320
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,290
satisfied of a long period of time

321
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:01,759
whoops then you develop trust which will

322
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:03,889
mean that you give a positive have a

323
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,809
positive idea about the future outcome

324
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,899
of that relationship that you have on

325
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:12,559
top of that this will develop into a

326
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:14,269
repetitive behavior and finally repeat

327
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,869
purchase and you eventually all these

328
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:19,279
factor in will become loyalty which

329
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,480
means that you will become an advocate

330
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,759
to that brand and that's something that

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,029
everybody in this room hopefully wants

332
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:28,370
to achieve be and the b2b or b2c setting

333
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,289
when we talk about cannabis quality of

334
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,450
course there's some things how we can

335
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,730
assess cannabis quality I mean

336
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,860
cannabinoid Trippi profile is one thing

337
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,500
that we know a water activity is

338
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,450
actually a metric that is super

339
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,279
important in food safety today in all

340
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,560
the food related industries and we're

341
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,509
just beginning today to talk about it

342
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,549
when it comes to cannabis and of course

343
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,990
contamination hopefully lack thereof

344
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:54,799
this is all things that we can measure

345
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:56,720
so and water activity which would

346
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,120
translate to the free or unbound water

347
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,879
within a plant so that's the stuff that

348
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,379
it's gonna evaporate first or that's the

349
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,750
stuff that's gonna be available for

350
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:08,240
biochemical reactions we need this all

351
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,980
along the value chain right this is

352
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,470
securing bond from a tobacco plant so

353
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:16,070
tobacco I know you you know produce it

354
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,279
and proceed as you draw it then you cure

355
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,110
it

356
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,209
that's called fermentation in that bag

357
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,669
and then you store it that's that's

358
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,470
pretty much like cannabis right

359
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:26,379
but the fermentation takes sometimes

360
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:30,460
years for tobacco and the one difference

361
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:33,159
is that every retailer in the world that

362
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,740
sells premium cigars will store their

363
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:38,529
products add a real military-controlled

364
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,100
you know a place or storage or whatever

365
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:43,360
that is and the same is true for

366
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,620
consumers because they don't that

367
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,629
they're gonna have a bad product

368
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,399
experience when the product is too dry

369
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,970
or that they will lose everything to

370
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,709
mold when the product is too moist so

371
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,210
for cannabis we have the same effect but

372
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,160
not that many people know consumers they

373
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,750
don't know anything about it in the

374
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,240
industry now we're starting to discuss

375
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,350
it and it's not only because you know a

376
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,149
dry flower also means light flower right

377
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,860
so everything is really attached to

378
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,779
water activity and the plant because we

379
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,279
have to remember that we have a plant

380
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,740
that's in decay so we cut it from its

381
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,509
nutrients it's it's beginning to die and

382
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,190
some of the processes and they're all

383
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:20,139
tied to the water cavity level in the

384
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,680
plant some of the process are highly

385
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,569
wanted

386
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,099
we call it curing and some especially

387
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,650
towards the higher end of that segment

388
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,050
we basically don't want because we don't

389
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,819
want to lose everything to mold so this

390
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:33,459
is why we need a maximum level of water

391
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,590
activity as a quality standard in

392
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,900
today's cannabis industry looking into

393
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,950
the future and the and the maximum level

394
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:45,519
is around point 65 of water activity

395
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:47,020
there you go told you what we also need

396
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,179
a minimum standard so what we did is we

397
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,949
took cannabis flowers into a lab for a

398
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,809
pilot study we'd put it into a closed

399
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,610
container for six weeks and measured to

400
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,469
the cannabinoid typing profile before

401
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:00,909
and after and we found an average loss

402
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,350
of 15% of terpenes and cannabinoids over

403
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,149
that short period of time in a sealed

404
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,500
container I have to say so what happens

405
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:07,299
if you know a little bit the biochemical

406
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,029
you know compounds you see that these

407
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:13,029
are pretty robust little things usually

408
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,889
say they don't decay that easily but

409
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:17,500
what happens is that your plant dries

410
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:19,029
down and the trichomes on your plant

411
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,100
they simply break off when you're too

412
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:23,230
dry this effect is being magnified when

413
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,440
you stir it shake it so once you start

414
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:29,110
shipping flour from Canada into Europe

415
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,960
from Israel into Europe from Colombia

416
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,330
into wherever you know you run the risk

417
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,269
of losing it especially nowadays for you

418
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,490
all

419
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,409
everybody likes these mylar bags because

420
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,180
they're so handy but it's impossible

421
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:43,278
that the chief out of the little corners

422
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,979
and it just you just lose it if let's

423
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:49,879
face it and you can avoid it by having a

424
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:52,039
having a humidity control with your

425
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,860
cannabis along the way this is probably

426
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,509
the most sold prescription that we have

427
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,730
in Central Europe I bedrock on and even

428
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,649
this container is leaking about 6

429
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,159
milligram of water per day in dry

430
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,500
conditions which will mean that of the 5

431
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,088
or the 5 gram dosage that we have here

432
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,600
the difference between let's say point

433
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:13,130
60 to water activity and point 55 where

434
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,500
you start losing at trichomes it's

435
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,480
basically just a hundred milligrams so

436
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,490
you have not even three weeks in the

437
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,379
worst case scenario where you start

438
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:26,419
losing some of the medicinal value of

439
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:28,458
that plant so humidification control

440
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:31,490
device you know technology would be an

441
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:33,229
obvious you know reply to that problem

442
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,269
and they're usually they could they're

443
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,129
made of like three components one is

444
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,329
water because if you want to remit it as

445
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,338
something you need water in that mix

446
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,120
there's a controlling agent this could

447
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:46,640
be right now the the predominant factors

448
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,839
are salt or glycerin and there's a

449
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,278
membrane that would just let the water

450
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,170
pass and would keep the controlling

451
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,480
agent inside of whatever you're gonna

452
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:55,659
use and I want to just give you like a

453
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,740
quick rundown of these two technologies

454
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:59,659
and what we have here as a salt and

455
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,299
water mix is actually set to sixty two

456
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:04,220
percent relative humidity and this can

457
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,438
actually lose up to a third of its

458
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,600
weight before you actually start going

459
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,370
below that point fifty five mark with

460
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,500
glycerin you're gonna get to that point

461
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:15,139
really fast at just about two percent

462
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,240
weight loss so you have all this red

463
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,610
area there and to be fair the graph

464
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,120
below really ends just at there half of

465
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:25,250
what the graph above is so why is that

466
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,318
so it's because when you when you use

467
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,459
salt you have the unfair advantage of

468
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:32,149
using different salts that have

469
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:33,710
different the liquid since points so

470
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,440
that's like a breaking point where where

471
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,500
any salt goes from from solid into fluid

472
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,140
States and above and below which the

473
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,880
salt would change from absorbing water

474
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,230
to releasing water again it's like when

475
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,330
you go to a restaurant you have salt on

476
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,269
the table and if you don't add rice or

477
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:49,559
anything in there it will get

478
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:52,139
plumpy so it would attract the humidity

479
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,849
but it will also dry out again you know

480
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,380
so this is and we take advantage of this

481
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:57,959
with glycerin it's not the same you have

482
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,400
only one glycerin compound and you can

483
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,069
achieve different humidity levels just

484
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,960
by adding or removing moisture from that

485
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:06,059
very same mix which means that once you

486
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,529
have one of those packs activated it

487
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,379
would simply create an equilibrium

488
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:12,480
between the pack itself and the biomass

489
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,910
that you're trying to mid off' i or to

490
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,680
dry down so we'll never stay at six two

491
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,050
it will be somewhere in between if you

492
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,360
add this to like moist conditions you

493
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,159
can you know it will it will continue to

494
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,500
come to to take on the excess humidity

495
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,269
and you can easily grow mold and if it

496
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,049
if it dries down you know you can go

497
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:32,819
into that in the red area again as well

498
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:35,309
so it's really about protecting you your

499
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,569
craft and i always compared to writing a

500
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,039
motorcycle you know you can write a

501
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:41,099
motorcycle without a helmet but it's

502
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,019
really stupid but you can achieve

503
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,939
motorcycle helmet but probably it's

504
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,009
better than no helmet but if you really

505
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,080
care what's inside your helmet you know

506
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:51,960
then you should use a salt based

507
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,369
humidity agent and there's a company

508
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,259
camp over there who has a patent on the

509
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:57,479
salt base ability just saying you know

510
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,940
just putting it out there so this is

511
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,500
this is why we choose salt / glycerin

512
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,350
it's because such it's much more

513
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,089
performant but it's not only about you

514
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:08,429
know it's not only about product quality

515
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:10,349
of course it's about top-line revenue on

516
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,570
top of that because and if you only want

517
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:15,689
the snapshot of one charge is probably

518
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:17,399
this one because we just what we wrote

519
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,920
down how much money you actually lose

520
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,840
from drying your buds on on a pound of

521
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,850
cannabis you know this is how much money

522
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,789
you can lose when you dry it down too

523
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:28,230
much and you if you know that the only

524
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:30,450
thing you have to do is add a little

525
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,269
pouch with a value of cents to the

526
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,360
dollar you know that's I just leave it

527
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:38,339
there the last thing I want to talk

528
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,899
about is something that I call big

529
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,539
corporations because everybody of course

530
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,730
loves big corporations when it and I do

531
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,529
too you know I'm not against it because

532
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,680
they bring so much value to the

533
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:51,769
marketplace and with the whole level of

534
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,049
professionalism and the marketing power

535
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:56,639
that you know they paved the way into

536
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:58,500
the mainstream and that's the way it is

537
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,230
you know and it's good but I won't just

538
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,009
one share like a last story with you

539
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,049
that

540
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,910
even these guys have their own agenda

541
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,230
for instance in the cigar industry in

542
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,029
the United States for a couple of years

543
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,470
ago the FDA came up with a new ruling

544
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,970
when it comes to introducing new

545
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,490
products into the market they have to go

546
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,970
to extensive lab testing or lab testing

547
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,319
all of a sudden and this is a lengthy

548
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,089
and very costly process and you would

549
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,980
think that especially companies with a

550
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:25,199
large number of SK used it would fight

551
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,319
against it but they didn't and this is

552
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,319
because they figured out that while they

553
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:37,740
have the power actually of oh it's 4/20

554
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:39,899
should light one up so why not so when

555
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,640
the FT so so they didn't fight because

556
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,280
they found out basically that it's

557
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,560
probably easier for them you know just

558
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,940
to let the small companies die or reduce

559
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,279
their rate of bringing new products into

560
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,269
the market Denix then you know because

561
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,129
they have the money to afford the

562
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:58,079
process other companies don't so they

563
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:59,880
did nothing so you should support the

564
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,559
activist right away you know they're

565
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,740
different lobbying groups don't mind if

566
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,740
I do

567
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:10,169
different lobbying groups you could

568
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:13,230
support right now in Europe and you

569
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,180
should do it right away from scratch and

570
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,390
there are many ways you can be creative

571
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:20,580
you know I have a friend who is a Jewish

572
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,830
Baker out of Florida and he teamed up

573
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:26,099
with the Muslim farmer there he's

574
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:27,960
growing ornamental flowers and they

575
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,179
getting ready to go for grouse license

576
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,150
once Florida goes online and he's really

577
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:36,450
using his his religious community you

578
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,040
know in order to put pressure onto on

579
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,470
the decision makers in this law making

580
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,700
process in Florida literally telling

581
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,190
them you know you're gonna be hunted

582
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,440
down by a bunch of angry rabbis and you

583
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,820
don't want this so I can't really help

584
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,740
you with this guys I'm not a Catholic

585
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,379
but I'm gonna leave you with that nice

586
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,180
image here and and a bright futures for

587
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,860
all of us and thank you very much for

588
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,340
your attention thank you let's hear it

589
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:02,389
again we have time for one or two

590
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:05,879
questions if anybody has any questions

591
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:09,020
anyone no questions not even like hey

592
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,050
can I get a hit of your vaporizer or no

593
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:14,259
all right

594
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,940
alex has a question so what do you think

595
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,500
the main I actually didn't see your

596
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,850
entire presentation may be covered with

597
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,289
bending what I did see was very good

598
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:23,259
thank you very much for being here dude

599
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:25,899
um what do you think the main crock the

600
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:29,170
main crossover point for cannabis and

601
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,269
your industry is you know what and and

602
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,269
are there any other industries that

603
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:36,279
that's an analogy or compare compared it

604
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,930
to well the main crossover point for

605
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:40,149
Europe is that people spool here like

606
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,470
crazy so you mixed about tobacco with

607
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,870
with cannabis but that's it's for

608
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,400
recreational the other thing is that I

609
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:47,109
mean for me it's really the the

610
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,380
different types of regulations that

611
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:52,269
should possibly come into play and this

612
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,280
is I know if you saw that part but as I

613
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:56,859
spoke about it just a little bit and

614
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,660
it's you will have to know that this is

615
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:00,969
going to be a heavily regulated industry

616
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,279
no matter what even we we will be

617
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:06,069
granting like broad access to the

618
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,990
product it will not be easy you know my

619
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:09,819
best educated guess right now it that it

620
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,920
will be available through pharmacies it

621
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:13,720
for Germany at least because we have a

622
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,779
very elaborate system you know and they

623
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,610
know how to store a number so but we

624
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:21,309
don't know and it's all you know it's

625
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:22,779
all up to us and and lobbying groups you

626
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,369
know like nacho hunt fabin and gave the

627
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:26,829
guys and making great make great

628
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,569
progress here so we have to support them

629
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:33,759
now in order to move it into the right

630
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:42,879
direction do you know some you speaking

631
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:45,700
nice so when Germany goes goes wreck do

632
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,680
you see that maybe you ever see cannabis

633
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,319
not being sold in pharmacies in Germany

634
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,000
or maybe some type of social club model

635
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:56,889
in the more progressive northern cities

636
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,529
like cun Hamburg Berlin well in boolean

637
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,670
well that they try to do it you know

638
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:03,549
think I mean you think that could ever

639
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:06,460
get legs I should be you know it really

640
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:08,859
comes down to our leadership which is

641
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,480
right now very conservative and in

642
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:12,669
Germany we talk about Germany it's very

643
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,380
conservative leadership once there's a

644
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,880
shift and the old people will die

645
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,840
eventually you know at some point but

646
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,970
apart from that our if that changes you

647
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,949
know I think everything could be

648
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,850
possible you know if everything is

649
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,170
possible

650
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:28,659
I don't think they're gonna make the

651
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,400
same mistakes that they did with tobacco

652
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,410
you know they want to avoid it

653
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,300
tobacco is just so widely available so

654
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,519
they have to put all the warning labels

655
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:38,440
and shock images in place to keep people

656
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,819
from buying it at the same times they

657
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,190
make so much money out of it that they

658
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:44,230
go won't go into prohibition you know

659
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,630
because people would go crazy and they

660
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,029
earn a shitload of money out of it so it

661
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,370
would be something in between tobacco

662
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:53,349
and the pharmacy model that was would be

663
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:55,899
my my way of thinking I think there will

664
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:58,419
be some tolerance allowed when it comes

665
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,950
to that more that social club model do

666
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,170
you think it'll be kind of this kind of

667
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:06,100
quasi little underground I think you

668
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:07,630
think that culturally that doesn't Spain

669
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:09,849
or like they do in Spain yeah yeah I

670
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,530
don't think it's - yeah I don't think

671
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:13,209
that Spain is gonna be model for Germany

672
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:16,269
because that's not how Germans are you

673
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,029
know yeah I think there is something

674
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:20,139
there no I don't see it I see it it's

675
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,750
gonna be in a controlled environment

676
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,540
with social clubs that you see in Spain

677
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,950
they're you know they're out of other

678
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:28,029
for each for everybody you know it's

679
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,710
like the police would go in there

680
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,559
eventually try to get a whole but they

681
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,090
can't because it's all covered you know

682
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,589
and then Germany would not let this

683
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:37,599
happen especially since you have the

684
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:39,069
devil look abroad like everybody else

685
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,769
would do you look abroad in different

686
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:43,359
industries into different countries and

687
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:45,849
they will see what's happening in Spain

688
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,069
you know and then you still have a large

689
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:51,119
black market even though you have the

690
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:53,799
the model right there right so it's a

691
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,809
coffee shop yeah so if you have gonna

692
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,339
have maybe we have special dispensaries

693
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,559
but why shouldn't the speed especially

694
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:04,589
pensa dispensary be just the pharmacy I

695
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,589
don't you know thank you again very much

696
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,690
you
