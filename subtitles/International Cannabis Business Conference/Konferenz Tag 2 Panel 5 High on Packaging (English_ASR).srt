34
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,519
we started a brand Nabi we don't do

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,039
packaging but we use really good

36
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,118
packaging and we know how to design a

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,659
good package

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,719
and uh it kind of shows

39
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,700
what do you want to to present with the

40
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,379
good package so I'm here to talk about

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,240
that thank you

42
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,780
yeah hey everybody my name is Felix

43
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,039
bishoping I'm CEO of pakiro we are a

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,920
germ company

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,200
um also supplying Packaging uh when we

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,079
started our idea was basically that we

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,879
have a solution for also small amounts

48
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,039
of packaging so we're very flexible in

49
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,420
our production so we can produce very

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
small amounts of bigger mods and then

51
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,200
when we started 2020 we directly saw

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,840
that there is a huge demand in the CBD

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,439
market and I think since that in Germany

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,899
at least most of the CBD companies know

55
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,340
us and we help them with up with our

56
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,219
Packaging

57
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,479
great thank you so packaging it's you

58
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,979
know it's uh it's one of those things

59
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,340
that a lot of people do struggle to

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,840
unwrap so you know when it comes to us

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,420
in Canada for example there's a lot of

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,520
regulations when it comes to

63
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,619
um how cannabis is packaged what kind of

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,300
materials you're able to use so you know

65
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,739
like first and foremost is packaging

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,719
design and how that relates to your

67
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,159
brand so maybe Petra you can lead us off

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,560
by saying like how do you what's your

69
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,598
thought process when it comes to how

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,699
your package is you know

71
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,459
is designed and what's your what's your

72
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,018
and how does that work out

73
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,120
when an architect

74
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,080
about a while I'm a visual type of

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,920
person and I believe that we are are

76
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,640
really visual people are really Visual

77
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:59,039
and uh the design of the packaging is

78
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,500
the first thing that people see and if

79
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,878
that you if you do a good thing then

80
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,219
people

81
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,739
take your product they take it into your

82
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,979
head to the hand and they can feel the

83
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,739
product have an experience with it right

84
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:17,280
and um I think it's really important

85
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:22,019
regarding the design and branding and

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:26,158
also materials you guys are doing a lot

87
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:29,759
of different materials and the other

88
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:33,299
point of view that we chose was also and

89
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:36,419
it was really important for us was reuse

90
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,480
um not only being recyclable but to let

91
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,179
people reuse so we use our

92
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,219
tubes which are really useful because

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,599
you can have your product in your tube

94
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:50,878
you can put a tube inside a drawer so

95
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,219
you have it packed like this people use

96
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,679
it for cables people use it for screws

97
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,019
for different different kind of kinds of

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,840
things they get creative with the

99
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,480
packaging and this was one of the most

100
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,519
important things for us to to to get

101
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,639
people our

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,219
box and reuse it again not just throw it

103
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,738
out and that's it and the other aspect

104
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:17,220
that we were really paying attention to

105
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,298
was the microplastics that come into the

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,979
product

107
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:26,159
so it was really hard for us to find um

108
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,978
packaging for creams lotions and stuff

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,840
like that

110
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:33,539
without plastic it's it's impossible

111
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,879
every part of a lotion pump is made out

112
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,120
of plastic you cannot do that yeah so

113
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:43,199
switching to tubes for us was a really

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,439
big thing we we ditched the Plastics we

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,960
ditched everything everything is 99

116
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,459
recyclable and I love how that's part of

117
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,319
your brand and you did mention also that

118
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,120
your aluminum tubes are locally sourced

119
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,219
yes right so that helps a lot too with

120
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,019
the overall carbon footprint yeah that's

121
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,500
that was one of the reasons why we

122
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,418
decided the tubes uh the production

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,759
company of the tubes is five kilometers

124
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:10,319
from where we are stationed so that's a

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,199
zero impact on the environment

126
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,259
um and it's actually really easy to

127
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,400
manipulate with the

128
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:21,000
products that you have if you have

129
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,519
everything by your hand so uh first line

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,579
that we did we got it from China it was

131
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,579
really well made premium products we

132
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,680
tested everything for migration of bad

133
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,060
stuff into the products everything works

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,120
worked fine

135
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,339
uh but it was expensive and it took a

136
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,259
lot of a long time so

137
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,439
those kind of things if you're pivoting

138
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:46,500
through the regulations of the CBD and

139
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,418
everything you need fast delivery lower

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,639
quantities and we can have this it's

141
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,139
amazing yeah so you know speaking of

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,699
regulations You Know Jack you're coming

143
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,160
from the American Market the U.S market

144
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,840
we're branding and and things like

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
that's a lot more liberal right can you

146
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,439
go through some of the processes with

147
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,359
you know design in the States because I

148
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,399
know in Canada everything is very very

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,220
muted I wish we had the freedom that you

150
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,978
did so so maybe you can kind of go over

151
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,440
some of that yeah I would say packaging

152
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:15,418
in the United States uh branding is

153
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,879
everything marketing is everything

154
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:20,459
because you have some of the largest

155
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,439
names biggest brands uh in cannabis who

156
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,899
are going to be there and going into a

157
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,959
dispensary in the states it is a circus

158
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,818
of colors shapes images everything you

159
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,560
can imagine on a mylar bag which is

160
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,900
radically different from going into a

161
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,899
Canadian dispensary where all that is

162
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,698
minimalized to be able to do that so my

163
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,318
company chubby gorilla that is what we

164
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,720
cater to so we call ourselves a

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,939
specialty packaging company we will get

166
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,460
your Pantone color we will get your logo

167
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,399
and then actually turn the packaging

168
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,739
into that color we also partner with a

169
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,899
lot of companies like Petras who

170
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,240
actually focus on the design of it and

171
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,038
we say hey we will make packaging for

172
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,538
you that you sell through to your

173
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,459
customers as well because they're far

174
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,019
more better at the design aspect we

175
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,060
would just rather make the the custom

176
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,918
packaging for whatever the functionality

177
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,079
that's needed so that's the biggest

178
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,359
difference that I see in the markets and

179
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,399
then even if I say the U.S market in

180
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,560
general I could spend another hour just

181
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,318
talking by state by state because they

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,939
still haven't had a a agreed upon for

183
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,340
what the whole country is going to have

184
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,439
as far as their packaging standards but

185
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,179
branding is definitely a key part of the

186
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,579
market that we play in

187
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,139
great well thank you for your Insight uh

188
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,579
now Felix you've been in the in the

189
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,280
flexible packaging game for a long time

190
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,379
how do you how do you see branding and

191
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,698
things like that play out in the in the

192
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,079
German Market

193
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,300
yeah I think it's the same with

194
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,560
marketing I mean if you if you often

195
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,199
look at the product they basically look

196
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,899
the same if you talk about coffee or CBD

197
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,419
or whatever you cannot really judge if

198
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,698
the how how good the quality is just by

199
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,560
looking at the product uh so the the

200
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,939
marketing aspect of the packaging is so

201
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,740
important and I think it's the same in

202
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,120
Germany or all over Europe I think

203
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,120
there's no difference to the States but

204
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,280
but still I think that there is a change

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,500
currently in the market because

206
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,959
um I mean for for example big Brands

207
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,279
we're only making the market so if you

208
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,500
look at the coffee brands in Germany you

209
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,418
had like I don't know 2030 a couple of

210
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,699
years ago and now more and more of the

211
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,198
small coffee brands appear yeah and they

212
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,060
all they're super creative with that

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,860
with the packaging yeah so with their

214
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,538
design with the packaging they want to

215
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,400
have an outstanding packaging so really

216
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,259
to to distinguish them from the others

217
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,239
especially from the big Brands and to

218
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,038
make them special and I think this you

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,959
can see all over Europe that these small

220
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,479
players appear and are super creative

221
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,158
with the packaging that's amazing so

222
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,560
let's let's dream a little bit now and

223
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,500
just imagine that you know cannabis as

224
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,778
an industry did legalize like how would

225
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,799
that affect you know packaging in in

226
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:52,259
Germany Slovenia and in the U.S

227
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,819
it depends in your opinion it's a very

228
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:55,620
open question right but it's also you

229
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,360
know like we hear you know everybody's

230
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,860
very optimistic so let's dream a little

231
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,139
bit right like the industry is what it

232
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,360
is it is a big discussion definitely and

233
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,639
but the the thing is really at the

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,220
moment nobody can say it exactly how it

235
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,500
will be and I think but there's certain

236
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,560
aspects which will be important yeah so

237
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,600
and I think one important aspect is what

238
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,059
will be the distribution channel so

239
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,339
either it will be mostly done via

240
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,500
pharmacies or it will be done a little

241
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,480
bit like the the way in the Dutch Market

242
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,278
where it's way more recreational and you

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,899
have coffee shops and all of this so if

244
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,480
it will go the direction more of the

245
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,799
pharmacies it will be kind of more let's

246
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,000
say yeah so we have the pharmacy looking

247
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,740
packaging but it goes more to the

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
recreational it will be more like a

249
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,000
aggressive marketing but there's also a

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,860
discussion because similar to to the

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,200
Netherlands who's not allowed to print

252
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,959
kind of marketing stuff anymore on

253
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,879
Tobacco packaging so this can be also an

254
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,199
option for for the legislation at the

255
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,120
moment that they really say okay the

256
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,160
packaging needs to be completely gray

257
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,080
and maybe only the logo will will be

258
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,199
possible so this is really a discussion

259
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,580
and I think it's it's really kind of in

260
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,399
the middle of this discussion at the

261
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,320
moment and other aspects but will be

262
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,620
also important like uh sustainability

263
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,899
definitely then a traceability so that

264
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,778
you can really trace the the packaging

265
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,539
back and uh yeah also a little bit kind

266
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:20,458
of protection stuff so there is even for

267
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:21,778
smaller like mailer bags you will need

268
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,259
something kind sort of a child

269
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,259
protection

270
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,110
I would more focus on the design point

271
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,759
of view

272
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,620
[Music]

273
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,039
of course sustainability and everything

274
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,139
that Felix said was is the same in

275
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:41,039
Slovenia it's um

276
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:44,338
the same thing but regarding design I

277
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:47,719
think the minimalism that we kind of

278
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:50,459
also wanted to present with our product

279
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,379
is becoming more

280
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,078
um

281
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:58,078
it's it's maybe more

282
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,699
people use it more so yeah

283
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,799
um

284
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,440
we get distracted every day by so many

285
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,778
information and by so many information

286
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,980
on the packaging you get lost you know

287
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:15,419
it's uh and everybody is trying to stand

288
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,060
out in a way and for for example it for

289
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:20,699
us it was easy because in cannabis

290
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,219
business everything is green or black

291
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,980
you know it's like okay so we'll be

292
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,740
right you know but in different kind of

293
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,600
uh product development and products

294
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:37,620
placing on the market uh I I see the

295
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:42,360
minimalism going to to the the little

296
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:45,000
information less colors less vibrant or

297
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,579
a different one in more colors and

298
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,700
everything just shiny and so on right

299
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:53,519
but um it's changing and you have to

300
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Pivot through the that's right yeah

301
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,500
trends that are coming so yeah yeah yeah

302
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,879
for sure because you know and on our

303
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,860
side of the world it's like you know

304
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,539
there are very very heavy regulations

305
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,980
right I wish we were more like you guys

306
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,500
jack and we had a little bit more

307
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,019
freedom but if you know if the U.S is to

308
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,879
ever legalize federally would you think

309
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,560
that would change uh cannabis packaging

310
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,360
anyway yeah I think the biggest thing

311
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,659
that's going to change is that uh once

312
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,300
we have Federal uh wide open now it

313
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:23,039
becomes truly creative and we've seen

314
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,559
some people get really creative with the

315
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,958
products that they want to offer uh I've

316
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,879
seen drinking straws that would have

317
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,439
powder in them so that way you put the

318
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,879
straw on the drink and you shake it up

319
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,459
and then you're good to go and you drink

320
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,838
with a straw right so as soon as these

321
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,699
things come about though the biggest

322
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,620
thing that happens then it all turns

323
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,360
into regulation and compliance and

324
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,060
that's where really we see a lot going

325
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,440
on in the state of California to make

326
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:47,879
sure that you have all your ISO

327
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,579
certifications to make sure you have

328
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,679
your GMP to allow for the flexibility

329
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,239
and the creativity that people want to

330
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,039
have now that you have everything

331
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,440
federally regulated so that's really

332
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,299
what we focus on just to make sure that

333
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,620
everyone has the certifications that

334
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,359
they need and then they can get as

335
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,578
creative as they want to get

336
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
that's excellent are there currently any

337
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,979
certifications needed for packaging in

338
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,979
Germany

339
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,759
um no not not written down yeah

340
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,940
um I mean there is a discussion about

341
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:20,039
GMP and on some some easel Norms which

342
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,920
probably will be

343
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,480
um uh the the standard but when it comes

344
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,979
to Pharmacy you definitely have to have

345
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,860
to look way more into the pharmacy

346
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,659
sector than into normal food places so

347
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,820
like is there like Charles uh child

348
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,399
resistance certification needed maybe

349
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,139
like food testing FDA testing needed and

350
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,179
things like that yeah I mean food is

351
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,799
easier than farmer so basically every

352
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,359
good packaging production is somehow

353
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,879
certified for food

354
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,860
GMP and Pharmacy is always the next step

355
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,379
and this is something you normally have

356
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,879
to implement excellent yeah so you know

357
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:52,679
the next question really would be

358
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,320
sustainability I mean you know cannabis

359
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,179
at its roots is a very Grassroots based

360
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,920
kind of industry so you know it's kind

361
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,778
of meeting the middle ground between you

362
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,759
know like the the corporate side of and

363
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,559
the business side of cannabis plus you

364
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,059
know meeting the Grassroots side too so

365
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,338
sustainability is right in the middle of

366
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:10,379
that and you know in Canada at least we

367
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,839
have you know we have a decent recycling

368
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,220
program Germany obviously is a global

369
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,320
leader in recycling and things like that

370
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,480
so you know what kind of materials and

371
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,560
what kind of packaging what do you see

372
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,360
being the leader in in Germany yeah it's

373
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,939
um it's definitely

374
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,800
um called Mono material so you basically

375
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,720
have to produce the packaging out of one

376
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,599
plastic material and then you basically

377
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,660
get all the certification that is it is

378
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,278
recyclable so either you choose ppep or

379
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,439
whatever plastic

380
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,720
it needs to be one and then you have a

381
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,360
good chance to be recycled but the EU

382
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,540
will basically next here in the middle

383
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,159
of next year will kind of discuss or

384
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,099
basically close a new law which is

385
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,778
called the ppwr and this will basically

386
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,820
wants to harmonize all this

387
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:58,500
sustainability laws across Europe and

388
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,860
this will be it will be super big

389
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,600
because the the changes will be big and

390
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,759
it will be always about recyclability

391
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,100
not so much about bioplastics or

392
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,720
bioplastic is a little bit out so it's

393
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,540
still under discussion but it really

394
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,579
looks like more Super recyclable and

395
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,500
reuse so what pet hermer just mentioned

396
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,899
so the EU will dramatically push

397
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,720
especially for the hotel and gastronomic

398
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:25,019
sector reuse Concepts and I think um

399
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,360
yeah sustainability will not be an

400
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,339
option anymore it will be mandatory I

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,879
love that I'm surprised that there are

402
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:35,160
no cannabis products you know material

403
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:39,419
cannabis is a great material also for

404
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:41,519
packaging there's so many on the so so

405
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:43,078
little on the market and so many of

406
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,399
other things yeah we're having that

407
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:45,958
conversation the other day where we're

408
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,120
talking about you know how hemp right

409
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,799
hemp is is such a great product there's

410
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,060
so many things you can do with it but

411
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,519
you know if you were to break it down if

412
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,919
you to use hemp plastic for example it's

413
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,100
still a compound it's still a hybrid of

414
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,019
plastic and hemp which still ends up in

415
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,459
the landfill right so until we come up

416
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,860
with something that's fully compostable

417
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:07,259
made out of hemp I think that's that's

418
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,300
great and but we're still a little bit

419
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,179
behind on that but there are many ways

420
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,879
for example like an egg cartoon it would

421
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,039
be easily made out of hemp nobody does

422
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,838
that you know why I think you have that

423
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,379
kind of packaging I think the biggest

424
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:25,079
thing is we have to look at the almost

425
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,539
Cradle to the Grave for a lot of these

426
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,278
products and so where I agree with you

427
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:32,278
there is a lot of hemp that could be

428
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,019
used it still has to go through the

429
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:35,519
Regulatory and compliance testing

430
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,740
especially at the pharmaceutical level

431
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,820
and some of it will fall way short of

432
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,259
that

433
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,360
um there's also things that we say hey

434
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,639
we could use more paper and then I look

435
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,680
about who else is using paper in the

436
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,180
paper industry and what are we doing to

437
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,419
make sure that we can grow the paper

438
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:53,278
back as far as restainable Forest we

439
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,078
also look at materials like glass and we

440
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,139
say Okay Glass the gold star of

441
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:00,599
recycling it takes a lot more heat to

442
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,159
melt glass and we just don't get it from

443
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,620
the sand on the beach you have to

444
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,298
disturb Marine environments to be able

445
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,639
to dredge that up so overall the

446
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:10,318
footprint for a company like mine we try

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,240
to look at the entire perspective and

448
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,759
say what makes the both the most sense

449
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,558
in certain markets and then what is

450
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,318
going to work when it actually comes to

451
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,818
testing and compliance but I think a lot

452
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,199
of packaging companies are starting to

453
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,938
explore this to answer some of the

454
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,500
questions that you have sometimes we're

455
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,720
limited by the state or the country

456
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,940
sometimes we're limited by what is

457
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,120
ultimately going to go into it

458
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,940
so what I see the most promising option

459
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,500
currently with with hemp is paper so

460
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,500
also when it comes to the legislation

461
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,240
about sustainability it's always about

462
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,220
recyclability so and if you have a

463
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,700
recyclable paper which is made out of

464
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,380
hemp which is possible and then I think

465
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,779
we have a good solution because one hand

466
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,640
recyclable on the other hand paper but

467
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,779
it is very difficult so we tried it

468
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,020
already a couple of times on our

469
00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:00,720
machines and it's really hard to find a

470
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,819
good paper which is manufacturable with

471
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,660
printing with spec making whatsoever

472
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,879
with

473
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,798
paper made out of him but I think it

474
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,240
will be possible next year yeah are

475
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,339
there any like government grants or

476
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,740
programs that support you know research

477
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:16,079
like this here in your respective

478
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,819
countries yes definitely yeah yeah a lot

479
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,699
do you use pushing that Germany is

480
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:22,379
pushing that and uh yeah I think that

481
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,880
there's there's really so much demand

482
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,440
actually currently on the market that

483
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,960
you really can also push forward I mean

484
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,880
Belgium will set up a law on the first

485
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,860
of January which will be super strict so

486
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,840
you basically it will be too expensive

487
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,519
to bring non-recyclable packaging to the

488
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,359
market so basically nobody will do it

489
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,519
anymore

490
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,139
and that's a really good point is that

491
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,660
we also have to watch what is the

492
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,880
ultimate cost going to be because if we

493
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,919
don't price it just right then you're

494
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,660
going to have a certain section of the

495
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,520
non-metric market Black Market if you

496
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,679
will that will just go and find other

497
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,960
packaging to use so we have to find that

498
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,759
sweet spot of does it meet our

499
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,860
Collective sustainability requirements

500
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,660
but also can we offer at a good market

501
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,939
price where people will have the demand

502
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,320
to actually get it from us

503
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,058
yeah for sure well there's a lot of

504
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,678
boxes to check off right and you know

505
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,298
they taking a look at the Canadian model

506
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,160
for example like

507
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:13,798
the companies they're they're not very

508
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,480
profitable between high taxes and you

509
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:16,980
know still trying to roll things out it

510
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,839
doesn't leave a lot of room for profit

511
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,819
so you know for us for example if I was

512
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,980
to say hey you know what a plastic tube

513
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,659
costs you let's just say five cents but

514
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,960
if you want to be sustainable are you

515
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,340
willing to pay 30 40 50 60 more and most

516
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,538
companies as much as they would love to

517
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,918
they just can't afford it right now

518
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:33,779
because you still got to keep the lights

519
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,460
on you got to keep the operation going

520
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,019
so that you know like you said like how

521
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,298
are we going to come together

522
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,139
to to alleviate that right I still think

523
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:42,000
you know

524
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,679
technologically and all those things

525
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,538
like you know where we are as an

526
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,919
industry we're just not there yet but

527
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:48,779
you know events like this really come

528
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,340
allows us to come together and really

529
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,079
kind of meld our minds and share our

530
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:54,298
knowledge to eventually figure that out

531
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,159
because cannabis you know in Canada is

532
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,139
five years in in most of the other

533
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,700
countries is just starting right so we

534
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,740
have a lot of time to figure it out so

535
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,298
I'm glad we're able to sit down and go

536
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,919
over these topics right and you know if

537
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:06,179
there's any questions in the in the

538
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,480
audience later we'd love to answer that

539
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,480
as well

540
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,740
is there any questions from the audience

541
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,740
or are there any wake up

542
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,220
okay so let's go back to sustainability

543
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,019
then right I think that's that's one of

544
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,759
the biggest topics right and so in

545
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:25,379
America and in the states I see there's

546
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,538
a lot of there is a lot of innovation

547
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,240
yes I'm seeing you know like uh ocean

548
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:32,879
ocean recycled plastic post-consumer

549
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,700
recycle plastic and even

550
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,000
um even uh compostable Plastics what do

551
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,460
you think is the and the front runner or

552
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,900
materials in the long run I think the

553
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,360
biggest one right now is going to be the

554
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,400
one that uh the Food and Drug industry

555
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,500
is using in the states and that is a

556
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,700
certain percentage of post-recycled

557
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:57,240
material so I think both uh New York in

558
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,000
2024 is going to demand 35 percent uh be

559
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,160
post recycled material California may

560
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,140
follow that but if any of you know

561
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,120
California it's just whatever it is that

562
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,980
they want to do because they don't

563
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,319
recognize compostable and they really

564
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,240
don't recognize biodegradable so I can't

565
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,460
even get the two states to to follow

566
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,620
that right now but I think that will be

567
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,079
the first phase and then after that they

568
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:22,319
will start to increase what that

569
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:24,538
percentage is as we go and then as we

570
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,939
approach that threshold of 45 to 50

571
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:28,200
percent then probably some compliance

572
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,519
will need to come into play to see if

573
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,340
the pharmaceutical company is

574
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,200
comfortable with that amount of recycled

575
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,178
material and where that's coming from

576
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,919
and how clean and how processed that is

577
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,880
so that's kind of where I see the window

578
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,700
going

579
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,799
amazing so Felix you have quite a few

580
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,940
sustainable options in your portfolio

581
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:46,798
right what do you see is the most

582
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,840
popular

583
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,658
most popular currently is really the

584
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:54,899
recyclable packaging but I mean being

585
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:58,200
honest I mean recyclable packaging is

586
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,240
only new packaging which can be recycled

587
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,220
so we don't close the circle here at all

588
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,859
yeah so it's really only the first step

589
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,759
and I mean we write a lot of Block taxes

590
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:10,740
and try to explain that and everybody

591
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:13,558
also misunderstands often recyclable

592
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,359
with it is already recycled so they said

593
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,418
hey we got recycled packaging no you

594
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,519
don't is there any thought to like

595
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,580
reusable packaging maybe you bring in a

596
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:26,158
glass jar or reuse will be big your

597
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:30,418
reuse will be a big topic but I have one

598
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:34,260
aspect of reusable that it's not many

599
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:36,480
times time seen and that's toxicity you

600
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,579
know if you use plastic and reuse it and

601
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,558
reheat it again and make the process I'm

602
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:44,220
thinking like glass or something like

603
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:46,139
that yeah I understand also also yeah

604
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,298
glass can be tricky too I understand

605
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,820
sometimes the necessity for child proof

606
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:52,099
packaging but apparently I am not as

607
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,720
smart as a child

608
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:56,538
because it is very hard to open and I

609
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,860
feel bad for some people who may have

610
00:22:56,538 --> 00:23:02,158
arthritis or problems and things and

611
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,779
can't I mean uh the liquor bottle is not

612
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,760
childproof packaging and that's probably

613
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,980
way more dangerous to your kids than a

614
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,720
five milligram gummy there's any

615
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,240
pushback toward that or you guys just do

616
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,919
whatever the test is it was very funny I

617
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,519
mean we had in Germany it's called tooth

618
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,559
uh t-u whatever

619
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,119
who's checking that and they told us how

620
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,700
they check it and they give it to 10

621
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,739
people uh who are over 70 years old they

622
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,480
need to still open the packaging and

623
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,700
pretend people who are below seven years

624
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,140
old so kids and they shouldn't be able

625
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,480
to open it and then you pass the test

626
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,640
yeah well in Canada it's very important

627
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,380
every every package going through

628
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,659
retailers has to be certified child

629
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,940
resistant so we independently certify

630
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,740
all our products and we take that into

631
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,220
consideration too right so we want to

632
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,839
make sure that medical patients and

633
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,000
recreational patients are able to open

634
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,038
it easily without any issues and things

635
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,558
like that but I mean having a child

636
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,298
resistant mechanism it varies sometimes

637
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:58,678
it's finicky if you're using a bag

638
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:59,759
sometimes you gotta stick your finger in

639
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,740
and kind of pull it through a little bit

640
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,259
so you know you know exactly what I mean

641
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,759
right and you know scissors scissors

642
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,619
work too but then now you can't reclose

643
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,400
it and now it's not child resistant

644
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:10,079
anymore

645
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,340
so you know there's a lot of a lot of

646
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,599
things you're trying to map on a workout

647
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:14,939
but you know

648
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,319
it's rolled out it's not perfect but you

649
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,538
know like I said the opportunities like

650
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,099
this to get together really it allows us

651
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:21,839
to dial it in a little bit and get a

652
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,439
little bit more feedback

653
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,439
yes

654
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,679
in Canada we're faced we call a price

655
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,679
compression at that store

656
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,159
so packaging is a it's a it's a part of

657
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,320
that so the consumers are relying on a

658
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,340
highest TSC for the best price and

659
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,500
that's the bottom line that's the

660
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:44,879
reality of the world but however when

661
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,440
they get our packages sometimes they're

662
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,419
like where is no recycling why is no

663
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,360
matter what happened all the you know

664
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:54,000
all those options are higher costs right

665
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,219
what is the industry doing to a gate a

666
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,839
better medium like to a better place for

667
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,259
us to do the right thing but also be

668
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,240
able to compete at the start level

669
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,740
that's a great question I mean I could

670
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,900
start with we know from a Canadian point

671
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,700
of view it's kind of like we have to

672
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,080
work together really and and come out

673
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,819
see what the budget is and things like

674
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,918
that what we do what we specialize in is

675
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:15,000
working with our clients to to figure

676
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,559
out what your budget is and we could

677
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,380
build something around that we do a lot

678
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,178
we've spent a lot of time in the field

679
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,799
um you know doing r d we visit a lot of

680
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:24,960
sites just to try to see how to make

681
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,400
things easier but at the same time I

682
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,558
think you know instead of looking at The

683
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,000
Upfront costs it's also about how can we

684
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,639
make your production more efficient

685
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,919
right I'd rather you know spend a few

686
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,720
cents more up front and save you a few

687
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,980
salaries on the back end right and

688
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,720
that's that's where we're going to see

689
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,278
these savings right so but there is no

690
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,360
real hard answer right now to that

691
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,278
unfortunately

692
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,599
you guys have any insight on that and

693
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,159
the only thing I can think is add to

694
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,740
that is that we try to offer different

695
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,260
tiers of products and hopefully there

696
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,120
might be a tier above or below that's

697
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,679
going to meet your right price range and

698
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,418
then also we have other ways because it

699
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,919
might just be distribution what is the

700
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,538
shipping cost to be able to get it to

701
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,640
you if I have a different place where I

702
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:04,379
can move a warehouse or a hub that's

703
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,380
going to be more suitable I try to find

704
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,059
other ways to help your business out and

705
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,580
then also just coming up with innovative

706
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,319
ways to be able to close and seal the

707
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,178
product if I can eliminate two machines

708
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,220
that you would have on a line or maybe

709
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,259
eliminate the use of shrink wrapping and

710
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,179
other materials that might also be a

711
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:22,740
healthy savings for you and you might go

712
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,120
in the direction of my packaging so we

713
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,019
try to look at it from that point of

714
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,899
view

715
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:29,339
sure

716
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,019
do you have any other questions in the

717
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,579
crowd

718
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:36,259
don't be afraid I'm wearing comfortable

719
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:36,259
shoes I can run right up to you

720
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,520
all right what do you see in the future

721
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,798
did we talk about that already did I

722
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,000
miss it well I'm uh you know I love I

723
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:47,538
love to be a dreamer about almost a

724
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,519
revealist so I think you know

725
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:52,079
the future is undefined I don't know

726
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,639
that's a very general thing to say but

727
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,859
you know like I said it all comes back

728
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,840
to the industry in the community right

729
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,519
like how can we build you know the

730
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,918
Cannabis industry that we can all love

731
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,538
and respect and profit at the same time

732
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,820
right I think there's a lot of there's a

733
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,379
lot of open space here and

734
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:09,538
collaborations like this is what it's

735
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,980
really about no I think the industry

736
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:12,859
will hate me for that but I think no

737
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,538
Packaging

738
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:17,819
seriously I think no packaging no no I

739
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,500
really it's called single-use packaging

740
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,240
so all the packaging that we talk about

741
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,640
currently is that you use the packaging

742
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,839
and then you throw it away yeah and I

743
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,400
think this would have an end in the

744
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:29,819
future I think this is something what we

745
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,580
we we invented something in the last 30

746
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,379
40 years where like resources were all

747
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:36,000
over the place and nobody cared so this

748
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,740
is the only reason why you come to such

749
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,140
a stupid idea like single use packaging

750
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,359
and I think this would have an end but

751
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,538
in the next 10 to 20 years that we only

752
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,939
have a reuse packaging I truly believe

753
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:50,220
in this and then that we don't use

754
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,900
single-use packaging anymore and if we

755
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,000
do then it will need to be fully

756
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,980
recycled and really use the material

757
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,599
afterwards again for new packaging so

758
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,099
either we close the circle or we only

759
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,918
have reuse packaging but I don't think

760
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:03,839
it will say the same as it is today I do

761
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,340
love the idea of reuse packaging we're

762
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,980
actually kicking the idea around back in

763
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,599
Canada and how we have to be to collect

764
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,579
everything though it's it's a huge

765
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,740
undertaking there there were some clubs

766
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,778
in Los Angeles and Oakland and Berkeley

767
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,519
who they would give you a discount if

768
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,440
you brought your glass jar back and then

769
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,960
they will wash it out and reason but

770
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,940
this is before everything had to be it

771
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,319
was more deli style right you put a lot

772
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,298
of big jar weed and you get the

773
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:28,798
Chopsticks and you you put it in the jar

774
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:31,259
and now everything has to be

775
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:34,200
individually packaged which is very

776
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:36,480
weird to me but also you get all those

777
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,340
beautiful loud packs and everybody's got

778
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,900
the super colorful packaging and it's

779
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:42,599
got a football player on it and all

780
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,940
these other things so uh it looks like a

781
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,459
pinata or you know

782
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,440
so I think we'll see what happens

783
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,880
well if we're here we're optimistic

784
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,860
right so I'm very glad that everybody

785
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,539
did show up and join us for this for

786
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,219
this panel I'd like to thank all our

787
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:58,079
great panelists I had a great time up

788

here thank you I hope everybody gets a

789
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,658
little take away from everything

790
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:03,119
regarding packaging so thank you again

791
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:05,100
thank you ICBC thank you Germany hope to

792
