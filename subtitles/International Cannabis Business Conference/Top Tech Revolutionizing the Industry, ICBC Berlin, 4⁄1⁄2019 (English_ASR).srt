1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,029
but we would also we're going to be

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,200
about doing about 20 minutes of

3
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:05,849
back-and-forth thing and then we're

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,830
going to ask you and currently encourage

5
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,509
you to ask questions from audience but

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,629
we're not going to do this right away so

7
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,888
as they were saying on the last panel

8
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,630
right the lobbying discussion in

9
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,809
particular is difficult and there's some

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,550
issues in this industry that are

11
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:22,108
persistent and have not been solved yet

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,719
and I think it's fair to say that

13
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,880
everybody on this panel believes that in

14
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,669
some way some of the larger industry

15
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,729
issues in part can be solved by

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,859
technology or at least greatly aided so

17
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,468
I'm going to throw this question out

18
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:40,439
immediately what and where do you think

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,890
technology of whatever kind can help to

20
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,689
continue revolutionizing this business

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,179
and if those of you guys don't do like

22
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,140
Storz and Bickel is that's sitting next

23
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,460
to me so I'm gonna throw it to you

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,230
quickly because everybody knows you're

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,289
made from your international innocence

26
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,390
yeah thank you very much money time yes

27
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,198
my name is Rebecca from source and

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,890
because we are producing vaporizers or

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,530
first revolutionising technology was in

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,228
the year 2020 product will gain a

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,810
vaporizer on the market before the time

32
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:17,039
you had to smoke it more or less or to

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:21,030
eat it there was no other viable way so

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,868
this was a one revolution but what today

35
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,879
is very normal

36
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,430
everybody knows there are tons of

37
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,219
products out there so it become a very

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,900
mainstream I believe the application

39
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,890
form will be in the future more

40
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,590
revolutionising we see all this

41
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,118
concentrate vaporizers and it will go

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,000
forward in this direction we see

43
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,040
alternatives like capsules but you can

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,349
in chess so I believe there the

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,729
technology will go forward can I just

46
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,228
add a little plug here I mean vaping is

47
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:50,879
seen as like the future not just of the

48
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,219
cannabis business but a lot of other

49
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,408
medications a lot of other kinds of

50
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,519
things right I mean yeah and

51
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,530
irresponsible yeah whatever can

52
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,629
but cannabis is a little bit special of

53
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,890
because of this decoupling oxidation

54
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:08,288
process THCA transformed into THC there

55
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,899
must be also substances still found what

56
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,848
can be viable for it so what about the

57
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,259
rest of you so please you know introduce

58
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:16,299
your firm quickly where do you see

59
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,429
technology helping to revolutionize the

60
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,930
business is it sales it's tracking is it

61
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,700
you know just knowing what you're doing

62
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,469
where are the things that you guys see

63
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,469
technology revolutionising the business

64
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,680
thank you that works hi my name is Jeff

65
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,170
Keene I'm the CEO of a company called or

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,930
product called 365 cannabis but it's

67
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:48,539
actually based on a Microsoft dynamics

68
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,830
platform an ERP platform so the way we

69
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,620
feel we're going to help revolutionize

70
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,390
the space is actually taking something

71
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,890
that works at outside the industry and

72
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,269
bring it in so we're looking at the

73
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,829
cannabis industry like every other

74
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,439
industry that's out there I think the

75
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,690
cannabis industry in markets like Canada

76
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,759
and the u.s. started out thinking it was

77
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,740
unique in every sense but from a

78
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,750
business process since it's like a lot

79
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,770
of other business it's Agri its food

80
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,479
process manufacturing its distribution

81
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,159
warehousing and in the US and now

82
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,169
starting to be in Canada is also its

83
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,930
retail so rather than look at it and say

84
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,819
how do I solve my problems in cannabis

85
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,200
for those things we're bringing a

86
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,909
platform from outside that does all

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,069
those things and applying it to the

88
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,020
cannabis space and then this term seed

89
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,509
to sale that comes out there in the US

90
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,159
and Canada where you're compliant if you

91
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,719
do all the right business processes and

92
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,159
you set the system up properly then

93
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,650
you're automatically going to be

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,739
compliant and you achieve your seed to

95
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,469
sale that you hear so often in US the US

96
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,500
and Canada anybody else have somebody

97
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:51,209
back here yeah absolutely say hey hello

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,909
everyone my name is Anna Sethi on the

99
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,770
CEO founder groomers consulting the way

100
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,389
that technology has actually

101
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,430
revolutionized the industry in my eyes

102
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,429
is that it's helped us scale this helps

103
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,780
us automate this helps accelerate

104
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,030
personally for me you know I I'm

105
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,890
launching a software called Odyssey it's

106
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,709
focused on licensing of Department for

107
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,779
cannabis businesses in the US and it's

108
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,120
it's really accelerated and scaled the

109
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,949
process of being able to do that even

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,019
though we can't fully automate it and I

111
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,899
think that you can acquit to you can

112
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,759
equate it to something like you know the

113
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,889
turbo tax or legal assume when the

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,379
cannabis industry and it's focused on a

115
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,759
lot of the pre-license aspects of giving

116
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,500
these entrepreneurs license getting him

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,209
up and running but I've seen everything

118
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,480
in my 25 years of doing this I've seen

119
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:37,379
everything from you know just these DC

120
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,300
to sell tracking him

121
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,709
our control systems all the way to like

122
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,439
robots AI drones inside cultivation

123
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:50,189
facilities that are spotting things like

124
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,170
disease pests and controlling these and

125
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,209
automating it and so we're gonna see the

126
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,879
same thing when it comes down to drop

127
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,349
shipping medic medication eventually so

128
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,209
it's really interesting to see how

129
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,910
technology is really taking this to the

130
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:05,579
next level and I can't wait we're really

131
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,439
excited to see that so I'm gonna talk to

132
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,000
you for a second so you see and I agree

133
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,230
with you technology is helping to

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
normalize as well as ultimate routine

135
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,860
processes that have also impart slow

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,649
down this industry is that it's absurd

137
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,020
absolutely and we have yet to see some

138
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,579
of the best out there I mean as we go

139
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,109
through this innovation period it's

140
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,870
almost like a renaissance period of

141
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,090
Technology we're seeing more and more

142
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,949
and more come out every single day and

143
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,909
everybody's just really taking it to the

144
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,909
next level so it's really exciting

145
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,830
so hello my name is many I'm the chief

146
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:42,719
product officer and interim CEO now it's

147
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:45,479
the technologies we're a Canadian

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,610
company were fully vertically integrated

149
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,710
ecommerce platform in Canada

150
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,530
specifically we have sales only license

151
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:54,449
which essentially forces us to be a pure

152
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:57,049
play a technology pure play company we

153
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,099
leverage technology to enable

154
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,000
optimization of the user experience and

155
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,140
we deliver solutions such as education

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,060
telemedicine applications the ability to

157
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,719
purchase cannabis online same-day

158
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,509
delivery

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,670
journal and etc and we can talk about

160
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:15,779
each one of these technologies are

161
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,310
siloed assets separately but my bias is

162
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,379
and it's going to be very hype this

163
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,089
around the artificial intelligence and

164
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,579
one of the things that we're focused on

165
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:26,699
is to try and understand how we can

166
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,990
leverage AI to help people find the

167
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,000
right product for them and actually

168
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,610
brought one of our lead machine learning

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,339
engineers with me so that everybody can

170
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,520
harass him and see him not just me

171
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:39,560
ha but that those just like the FinTech

172
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,959
industry was really changed where you

173
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,829
had people were very very passionate

174
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,209
about what they're doing an

175
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,219
understanding regulation and using

176
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:49,009
technology to change that industry and

177
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,860
we still see that impact since 2009 till

178
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:54,589
today v ik is still changing literally

179
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,990
we're in the infancy days of Technology

180
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:58,369
and cannabis combined so so anyway we

181
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,449
met pay for those of you who don't know

182
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,850
what it is it's not many feet of

183
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:03,830
advertisement but we are using watching

184
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,389
and we're actually going to no matter

185
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:07,459
what the technology is I think here

186
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,590
whether it's hardware or software there

187
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:12,019
are ways to use existing technology to

188
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:14,119
automate processes there are ways to use

189
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,789
new technology to push the envelope

190
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,990
there's a whole bunch of innovation

191
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,970
that's coming out but one of the things

192
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,918
also that struck me about this panel was

193
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,389
how the international it is ok so you

194
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,519
have people here with the international

195
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:29,449
experience and technology certainly

196
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,219
across oceans is different and a lot of

197
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,620
us are looking at the compliance space

198
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,750
one way or another how about it just

199
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,569
shout out where are where do you think

200
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,120
the International cannabis industry in

201
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:43,519
some ways has started to reform or put

202
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,959
pressure on or change the cannabis

203
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,750
industry in other places and how does

204
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,329
this chemistry now being international

205
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:55,399
play into the revolution revolutionising

206
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:58,219
idea of tech in this application yeah I

207
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:01,159
am we have the last 12 months we

208
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,050
distributed into 19 countries around the

209
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,840
world so it's very to national and it's

210
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,759
everywhere available and of course with

211
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,159
this technology you have done the way

212
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,009
how you can consume cannabis in a

213
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,090
medical way you have 10 inept ways it

214
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:18,978
you can try all that and so it's the

215
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:22,569
technology is really a nowadays

216
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:24,649
distributed worldwide in a very fast way

217
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,509
but it's compliance different from

218
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,389
country to country right yeah exactly

219
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,360
and I've called my European

220
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,169
Andre we are here a medical device

221
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,050
manufacturer a medical device

222
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,959
manufacturer means that he needs to be

223
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,089
have a quality management system it's

224
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,860
called traceability what is called C to

225
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,980
say on the other hand on a device and

226
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,659
destroys ability if you get back

227
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,940
defective device with a serial number

228
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:51,129
you must be able to track back but you

229
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,340
purchased every single part you built in

230
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:57,009
and where you have it so to so the other

231
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,570
requirements are relatively high and

232
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,220
they are different from country to

233
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,140
country for example you don't have

234
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,180
medical device in the USA because the

235
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:06,879
FDA is not ready to approve a medical

236
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:09,849
device then if you go to Israel you F of

237
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,980
course also other requirements labeling

238
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,190
in Hebrew in Arabic can also be a bit

239
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,580
challenging stuff like that and the

240
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:24,220
latest compliance in regard is the GDP

241
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:27,160
are the channel directly from the SP 400

242
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,519
confirmed no privacy yeah yeah privacy

243
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:33,250
law so this gives you also another

244
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,850
compliance I think what I think from

245
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,799
people from North America they are not

246
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,889
ready for the GDP are as far as I can

247
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,319
and I can see of course the law is less

248
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:47,649
than a year old politically it's a

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,200
strict law and it's a bully I leap

250
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,759
unshed law and it will be followed it so

251
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,280
I think it will also affect a lot of

252
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,230
people who touch Europe in any in any

253
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:00,370
babies their products there's some

254
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,779
compliance coming up I'll take the next

255
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,060
one concern interesting question on

256
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,429
compliance because so we do business in

257
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,989
Canada us and there's a number of

258
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:11,139
international companies in Colombia

259
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,279
Jamaica Australia Denmark that we're

260
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,870
dealing with right now in the cannabis

261
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,730
industry but the platform is already

262
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,590
international so if you look at the

263
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,600
platform work we're using for ERP is

264
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,670
already almost in every country in the

265
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,100
world including Germany just not in the

266
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,990
cannabis space so the Canadians when

267
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,279
they came into the space with their out

268
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,009
bees and we came in a few years

269
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,409
afterwards we saw the legacy of this was

270
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,419
they compliance to them was just in my

271
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:35,860
complaint to Health Canada and I'm

272
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,599
meeting the regulations so I can keep my

273
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,629
license and they didn't think about

274
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,278
compliance in any other way

275
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,068
so now all of a sudden the Canadians are

276
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,208
coming to us and asking us for GMP first

277
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:48,059
of all I think they probably had to look

278
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:50,159
up the the acronym is most of us do good

279
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,078
manufacturing process which in order to

280
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,028
export your product from Canada to

281
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,059
countries like Germany you have to prove

282
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,828
that you are a GMP processing facility

283
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,169
and the Canadians weren't thinking of

284
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:03,568
that at all so it's I think in some ways

285
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:05,399
the international space has a way to

286
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:08,039
benefit from what was already learned in

287
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,169
the US and Canada not do the same things

288
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,679
look at it as a business that has to be

289
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:15,539
compliant as it vs. a compliant industry

290
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,099
specific to candidates that has to run a

291
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:20,519
business and his compliance everywhere

292
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,409
GD P R GMP FDA requirements are not in

293
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,940
the US yet but they're coming so all

294
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,278
these things have to be in place their

295
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,839
public companies now trading so now Sox

296
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,149
compliance and how your financial

297
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,889
reporting goes so we actually had to

298
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,870
employ which I didn't think I'd ever

299
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:36,180
have to do running a software company as

300
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,490
higher compliance chief officer just for

301
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,469
us to handle not only what's going on in

302
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,060
cannabis but also the compliance ins

303
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,290
coming at us from everywhere else I'm

304
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,328
gonna push this one to you right so

305
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:47,519
that's a discussion about what can

306
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:49,349
technology do to revelers revolutionize

307
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,839
the industry I think sales and

308
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,519
advertising is certainly there right

309
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,350
however controversial and I wanted to

310
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
throw it in that direction because you

311
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,970
know the question is about how

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,680
technology can be applied to overcome

313
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,949
some of the bigger issues whether its

314
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,019
compliance or laws or etc certainly

315
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:10,139
sales online the discussion of the

316
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,549
industry press online 2014 helped push

317
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,198
forward a whole bunch of things how do

318
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:15,409
you see this working how do you see this

319
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,549
technology discussion changing

320
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:18,929
regulatory frameworks that are still

321
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,629
holding the industry back like

322
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,708
advertising or etcetera so so that's a

323
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:25,799
very important point to remember that

324
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:28,649
everybody's very afraid of compliance

325
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,419
gdpr and they're very worried about what

326
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,980
are we gonna do with it

327
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:33,019
essentially if you look at it it could

328
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,570
be a huge opportunity because the

329
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:38,569
existence of gdpr raises the bar and

330
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:41,270
allows you if you build systems in place

331
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,550
to comply with that allows you to create

332
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:46,429
moats around your business so for

333
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:48,019
example part of GPR and I'll get to the

334
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:50,989
advertising sales promotion part of GDP

335
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,699
RS is security by design or segregating

336
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,889
data not collecting data that you

337
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,960
shouldn't if you don't need it for a

338
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,939
true process so for example one of the

339
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,190
things with automatic processing of data

340
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,960
is that it's not exposed to humans so

341
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,760
you can segregate it within the system

342
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,769
and then you're protected from a

343
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,870
compliance perspective you can automate

344
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,610
a lot of the requirements that gdpr has

345
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,080
and then you create those modes about

346
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,850
the business and and you use that

347
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,770
there's an opportunity specifically

348
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,120
around sales and marketing that's really

349
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,899
interesting because I spent the morning

350
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,820
talking with a lot of CBD producers and

351
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,829
suppliers here and the one thing that

352
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,260
everybody spoke about is like we cannot

353
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,850
advertise we cannot sell our our

354
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:30,559
products online or so we're not ever

355
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,810
test a product I even though the panel

356
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,679
previously that spoke about the exact

357
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:39,049
same point and CBD let's take it as an

358
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,269
example in many countries many countries

359
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:42,949
is completely Mingo however the big

360
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,159
advertising networks like Google and

361
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:48,890
Facebook Adsense double-quick etc those

362
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,569
are the ones that don't allow you to

363
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:53,059
advertise and guess what happened a

364
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,100
Google on GDP or in France there's a

365
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,689
disruption so I just want to come back

366
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,850
to you that cuz I think your system

367
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,710
actually helps people comply by

368
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,330
automating it literally by using the

369
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,310
legal form so you're kind of combining

370
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,200
those two do you want to talk a little

371
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:08,059
bit about that yeah sure I mean you know

372
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,500
just as you were stating about you know

373
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,059
the different countries to have

374
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,909
different laws or that are just coming

375
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,739
online or becoming aware and educated

376
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:17,509
just in state California alone it's like

377
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,610
that it's like the whole world are all

378
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,559
worlds policies in one state so as we go

379
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,539
from city to County to the state level

380
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,949
it's all different just like you go

381
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:27,199
throughout the United States it's all

382
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,360
different so we've had to find a way to

383
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,970
kind of shut that based on best

384
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,039
practices we know that the FDA is going

385
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,110
to step in eventually just like you have

386
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,819
you should always be focused on good

387
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,560
manufacturing process in practices or

388
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,840
good business practices that's a fair

389
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,329
oran factor when you're coming in and

390
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,860
exporting to the EU as well because if

391
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,750
you're not compliant then you're not

392
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,759
going to be able to serve that market I

393
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,110
think that uh when it comes down to it

394
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,639
when it comes to have the technology let

395
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,310
me ask for a quick how many people in

396
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,159
this room right now are in a start-up

397
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:59,959
mode for a tech company Laura or in a

398
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,110
tech company right now how many people

399
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,240
anybody great awesome so we are not

400
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,950
limited as what I'm saying with

401
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,750
technology you can license that

402
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,270
technology you can take that technology

403
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:14,210
to other countries you're not limited

404
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:16,669
like cannabis is limited and for the

405
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,339
fact that we are you know a technology

406
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:21,409
firm or able to actually serve more

407
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:22,640
markets than our counterparts you are in

408
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:25,699
the cannabis industry trying to get

409
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,899
licenses of cannabis and that's the

410
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,460
thing that we always need to compare

411
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,679
that to in my opinion you said license

412
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,900
technology to others is AWS right AWS

413
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,219
started as an internal solution for

414
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,379
Amazon because they couldn't find

415
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,850
something that met their needs and now

416
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:39,679
it moved to a ten billion dollar your

417
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,600
business because they every who here

418
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,639
doesn't you or uses AWS in their

419
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,670
business right so I think so I think we

420
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,809
can all agree right that in some ways

421
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:49,338
technology is revolutionizing the

422
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,959
industry because it's normalizing it

423
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,670
it's saying this is just a commodity or

424
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,889
it cetera so but as a way of a lead-in

425
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:57,079
and I saw a lot of hands go up there are

426
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:00,110
a lot of people in startups and we would

427
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,790
like to now open the you know the field

428
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,190
for opera for questions so if you have

429
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:05,539
questions please go ahead and bounce

430
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,490
them back to us because one of the

431
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:09,110
things we were talking about before we

432
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,519
came on here is I think I'm one of the

433
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,360
few people actually who's gone through

434
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,500
the German incubation system there are

435
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,600
opportunities if you are starting to

436
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,429
look at applying technology and want to

437
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,290
apply technology in this revolutionary

438
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:23,539
business where you can start to enter

439
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:25,759
the market in new and different ways in

440
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,958
part by normalizing that in part by

441
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,838
saying I'm not just dealing with

442
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,088
cannabis as this crazy plant I'm dealing

443
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,220
with a narcotic that has to be that's an

444
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,100
awful evil drug it has to be approved or

445
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,070
etc or I have to try to plant fortitude

446
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,839
ah so I think how would you say that and

447
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,000
you're going to pick on you again how

448
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,800
would you say that technology has

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,120
changed the equation

450
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,679
normalization if that makes them mean to

451
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,019
me for example you have to get you have

452
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,969
to go through insurance approvals as a

453
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:57,769
medical equipment provider you're the

454
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,230
only person on stage has to go through

455
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,570
that so technology is also adding a

456
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,390
different level of compliance to you as

457
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:08,660
well is that revolutionary to you for

458
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,949
example as a medical device manufacturer

459
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,990
of course there are there are a lot of

460
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,610
medical devices so it's not so important

461
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,720
if it is for cannabis or for something

462
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,490
else you need to follow the medical

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,650
device rules and they are there and if

464
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,548
you comply lie and there's of no reason

465
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,829
to decline any allowance to it on the

466
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:27,918
insurance idea we have tried to get here

467
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:30,048
in Germany generally recovers to get on

468
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,030
there's a list it's metal this thing

469
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:34,339
ever you can get on then you get a

470
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:36,649
tender doctor can prescribe it and the

471
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:38,240
place you get it green bars but

472
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,548
unfortunately we have not reached to get

473
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,460
on this list yet they are still too many

474
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:45,019
holes and they are still unsure and a

475
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,660
fear that they are get a lot of

476
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:50,418
prescription fights but we are working

477
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,000
for and hopefully they will have to yeah

478
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:55,549
at least we can work a deal on that

479
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,919
question so anyways I mean I think for

480
00:17:55,548 --> 00:18:00,910
example you for example are actually in

481
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,500
a licensing and processing approval

482
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:05,120
discussion correct yes correct I mean

483
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,940
you know essentially again it comes back

484
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,579
to their regulations at the state level

485
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,929
in the u.s. in this case and in Germany

486
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:14,178
or other heirs if they were to do

487
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:15,919
licensing it would be anything that they

488
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:18,080
obviously the government level so we

489
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,940
what we do is we sort of analyze when

490
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,048
when regulations come out you know

491
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,509
regulations are shifting and changing

492
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:25,519
this is it's dynamic compliance I like

493
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:28,099
to call it really because this whole

494
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,990
space is very dynamic so when it comes

495
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,909
down to it we have to really navigate

496
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,769
these processes but if we can accelerate

497
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,808
it and lower the barrier of entry and

498
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:37,429
put you know promote more diversity and

499
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:38,899
bring more players into this game you

500
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,150
know to really get it to the point where

501
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,759
folks can really innovate we are gonna

502
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:46,790
see a hyper jump in that space in terms

503
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,099
of Technology in terms of how you know

504
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,829
folks actually operate and so we want to

505
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:53,599
ensure that first that you guys get

506
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:55,099
permanent and regular it regulated and

507
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,159
licensed and then there's ongoing

508
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,419
compliance

509
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,310
that handle and everything else because

510
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,840
everybody's focused on that section as

511
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,250
opposed to the pre-license section so

512
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,679
that's where our focus is

513
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,180
but again coming back to technology and

514
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,710
how it's changing the face of the

515
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,420
landscape there's things like the

516
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,630
Internet of Things for instance IOT

517
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,550
we're seeing IOT manage like how the

518
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,380
plants growing you know checking you

519
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,509
know it's like full automation on this

520
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,820
right and so as a business owner that's

521
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,680
trying to scale and serve a high demand

522
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:24,899
in this marketplace things like that are

523
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,779
pretty important I mean it lowers the

524
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,140
the costs associated with it we're able

525
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:33,420
to really magnify the ability to grow

526
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,700
these plan exactly the same way over and

527
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,500
over again which is consistency so we

528
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,299
have a fracture supply chain now on the

529
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,710
global level but you know just to

530
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,809
basically us or just based in the state

531
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,259
of California it's still a fractured

532
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:48,929
supply chain so we're not able to get

533
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:50,670
the same consistency on products because

534
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,029
businesses are scaling and this is a

535
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,710
plant that changes it's it's you know

536
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:56,940
it's consistency over the course of time

537
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,529
I should scale it or have you for

538
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,370
nutrients or a different lighting

539
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:01,410
all right different management

540
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:02,539
techniques on my plan so it's really

541
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,640
interesting to see how technology

542
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:07,649
shaping that but most importantly is

543
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,910
that it just innovations doing that this

544
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,140
isn't never stopped it's gonna happen

545
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,640
over and over and over again

546
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,160
just like with the internet when it

547
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,140
first came out so I like to come in here

548
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,210
to that because that's how fast this

549
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,009
thing is moving right and so I would

550
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,319
HIGHLY highly recommend take advantage

551
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:23,369
of that absolutely so so I'm going

552
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,079
through the Sally is there anybody with

553
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:27,679
questions right now he wants to ask the

554
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,899
panel anything we're gonna keep going

555
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,490
okay sorry didn't know I think you had a

556
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,730
specific issue that you wanted to bring

557
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,470
up in terms of I think you were sort of

558
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,930
talking about the fact that to try to

559
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,299
take it to the next level that of all of

560
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,970
us in some ways from a technology panel

561
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,649
or a technology solution well just I

562
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,670
just generally lessons learned right I

563
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,530
mean exactly

564
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,029
coming coming coming with it from a

565
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:52,619
platform that already works in other

566
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,930
industries and coming into the canvas

567
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:57,389
space into North America first of all

568
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,799
the international space has at once a

569
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,750
life time opportunity to set their

570
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,430
business up from the ground up

571
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,049
not only because cannabis is new but the

572
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,460
businesses are new in setting it up the

573
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,369
right way with technology and making

574
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,919
some of the right

575
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,778
decisions most most US companies that

576
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,240
are in the space have probably gone

577
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:15,730
through two three four different

578
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,990
iterations of solutions whatever they

579
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,788
tried in the beginning didn't work

580
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,069
they're now on to you know multiple

581
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:22,240
others and from our standpoint this is

582
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:25,149
where we're now coming in from the

583
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,220
outside saying you're in agriculture you

584
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,710
grow in greenhouses people have been

585
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,390
growing in greenhouses for decades

586
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,038
hundreds of years and there's already

587
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,200
software out there that does that for

588
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,579
you so why are you trying to apply for a

589
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,679
new software does something that's

590
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:39,730
already established out there so we're

591
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,169
kind of coming at it from a different

592
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,419
way saying you're in supply chain

593
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,409
management that does agriculture that

594
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:47,890
does food process manufacturing

595
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,840
distribution and potentially retail so

596
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,309
for us we're not looking at it having to

597
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,808
introduce something brand new because

598
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:55,269
the space requires it we're trying to

599
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:56,500
normalize it by saying it already exists

600
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:58,148
out there don't go make the same

601
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,648
mistakes that the others did where

602
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:01,959
you're buying software from the ground

603
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:03,129
up that isn't proven anywhere yet but

604
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,329
it's trying to find itself in the

605
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,370
cannabis space because it's gonna get

606
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:07,808
out of scale as you normalize the

607
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:09,250
business out there all those other

608
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:11,319
things start to hit you the normal

609
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,028
business processes that every other

610
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,689
business runs in and the Ender you're

611
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:15,849
here to make money

612
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,710
on these businesses it's not just about

613
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:19,269
you're in the cannabis industry and what

614
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,769
software will work for that we'll see

615
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:22,898
and this is where I'm hoping to

616
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,179
introduce you no controversy here so you

617
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:27,308
know obviously your bed pays you see a

618
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:29,830
new technology called blockchain right

619
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:32,528
and how do you integrate that into a new

620
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:33,849
industry while minimizing risks and

621
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:35,558
attacking the issues that you're

622
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:37,058
attacking well one of the ways that we

623
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:38,950
have decided to go forward on this is

624
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:40,898
actually blending this so we're holding

625
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,519
workshops where we're bringing

626
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:44,769
stakeholders together who aren't

627
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:46,418
necessarily tech geeks but there are

628
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:48,009
business people with problems and

629
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:49,778
they're coming together and they're

630
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:52,778
discussing them and that is how we're

631
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:54,640
starting to I think also start to pin

632
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:56,619
new technology processes and

633
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,500
re-engineering into a new business which

634
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:02,199
it very much is here as much as we are

635
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,048
I guess re-engineering processes so I

636
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,600
think that this for us the cannabis of

637
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:10,058
vertical has given us a way to address a

638
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,969
larger problem that is faced for example

639
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:14,730
by the chronically ill people who need

640
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,298
to get expensive medical equipment

641
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,710
pharmacies people who are touching this

642
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:20,839
system but didn't necessarily have

643
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,278
another way to touch it but but I'm

644
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,359
gonna throw something also out here

645
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:26,749
because everyone's talking about this

646
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,849
the whole enabling ash aspect or not

647
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:30,139
enabling aspect especially with you

648
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,959
throwing privacy and all the other

649
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:35,388
issues about online sales right because

650
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,028
online discussion about this industry I

651
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:40,278
think has very much led to greater

652
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:41,898
legalization as much as governments have

653
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:44,388
not maybe gotten the regulation right so

654
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:46,398
far but clearly I think the online

655
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:48,258
discussion in technology does lead to

656
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:52,849
online sales would anybody like to take

657
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:55,608
a and dive into that as and also from

658
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:58,638
the the enabling and also the privacy

659
00:23:55,608 --> 00:24:01,128
perspective so you want to yeah I can I

660
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:02,808
talk about online aspect of it I mean at

661
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:05,898
the at the end of the day that's where

662
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:08,749
the industry all businesses are going to

663
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:11,358
right because as humans we are lazy we

664
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:13,548
wanted a path of least resistance so if

665
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:14,868
I'm able to sit at home and if we look

666
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:17,358
at the full stack of the cannabis

667
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:19,308
industry if I'm able to get a

668
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:22,489
prescription without leaving my house

669
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:23,960
and then buy a volcano

670
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:26,749
without leaving my house and have it

671
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,028
delivered I will likely prefer it over

672
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:31,399
having to leave get in my car drive

673
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:34,278
there's no see a doctor and go to a

674
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:37,699
pharmacy pick up the product etc so from

675
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,230
in regards to ecommerce right obviously

676
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,759
I'm quite biased so I can continue

677
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,480
talking about that aspect for for a

678
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:46,579
while but it is something that is

679
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,108
driving this industry forward well let

680
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:50,178
me let me be up to analyze gets it easy

681
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:51,589
the e-commerce or is it telemedicine I

682
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,929
mean I think that there are two aspects

683
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:57,019
this is the telemedicine there's the

684
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,909
e-commerce there's the do people feel

685
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:01,069
comfortable not seeing a doctor our

686
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:02,629
regulatory agencies were taken when you

687
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:04,308
get into the narcotics side of this is

688
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,628
gonna say yeah the years of schedule -

689
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:08,239
you don't have to come see a doctor

690
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:13,908
anymore is that realistic Germany you're

691
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:15,470
gonna today I read that you can get then

692
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:17,450
you can get online - it up dying

693
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,329
you can claim to be ill for your

694
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,710
business and yeah this is a new system

695
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:23,298
who is available here but it's very

696
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:27,669
controversial and the doctor doesn't get

697
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:27,668
paid yet by the way there's some issues

698
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:32,119
maybe an so general remark about

699
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,908
compliance because it was here about

700
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,739
fearing compliance or I I think it's

701
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:39,860
very important to be compliant until I

702
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,329
think every managing director CEO must

703
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:44,178
take care to be compliance and

704
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:46,009
especially in this field because on the

705
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,809
one hand you don't want to get extra

706
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:49,970
holes because you are treating something

707
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:51,678
with cannabis but on the other on the

708
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,720
other hand you also do not want to get

709
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,700
to be very favorite because it's gonna

710
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,620
have a sensing you can you don't need to

711
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,120
be compliant because it's cannabis all

712
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:00,469
the sites you don't want to see you want

713
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,069
to see you don't want to get extra

714
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:08,960
levels but you also want not to get in

715
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:10,308
any easy way on well let's move up your

716
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,470
bit being on the compliance because I

717
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:14,960
think technology can also used for

718
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:18,019
research right and and sort of the big

719
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,240
data data gathering aspects I think of

720
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:21,230
basically all of what we've decided I

721
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,390
mean I think what's interesting about

722
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,950
you guys is you're moving me more and

723
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,900
more into a world where you can gather

724
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,308
information online for example through

725
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,650
the bait I was soon right

726
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:32,178
I don't want to say but regardless I

727
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,798
mean there is there's definitely this

728
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,500
whole discussion male about digital

729
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:39,079
health in the cloud and privacy issues

730
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,220
how would you I don't have touch of my

731
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:44,629
one yeah we we actually built in that's

732
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,700
not were the problem right the problem

733
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,049
is that a lot of people use cannabis but

734
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,390
there is no way for them to actually

735
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:52,429
measure if it's helping them or not so

736
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:54,440
there are not a lot but quite a few

737
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:55,788
companies that build solutions to

738
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,440
address that we are one of them there's

739
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:59,089
a great company that these are here

740
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,370
today strain print that does the same

741
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:05,298
thing and essentially allows people to

742
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:07,548
track usage and the impact of products

743
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:08,808
on their symptoms and initially at least

744
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:10,548
that's what we released this were like

745
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:13,279
no one's ever gonna give us any data and

746
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:14,990
we were very surprised to see that

747
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,700
actually people were very forthcoming

748
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,440
but they weren't Germans that were they

749
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,360
right no there might be droids right but

750
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,870
the people who are very very forthcoming

751
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,299
with

752
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:26,899
because there was a lot of value that

753
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:29,269
was created in exchange for that day too

754
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,009
so that's something that is is actually

755
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:33,920
moving forward in the idea of being able

756
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:37,789
to collect real data from real people

757
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,070
and analyze it and generate insights has

758
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,960
value across the entire list you want

759
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:43,669
for patients for example were able to

760
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,410
recommend what strains are right or

761
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:49,340
wrong for them for the industry we're

762
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:51,259
able to help growers understand what's

763
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:52,970
popular what they need to grow because

764
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:55,160
of growth cycles for device

765
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,200
manufacturers they can understand what

766
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,300
temperature's people are using is it

767
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,390
conduction convection based what are the

768
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:04,549
most popular models etc there is so many

769
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,259
different elements that can be used that

770
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:09,230
are valuable for both parts of the

771
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:10,460
industry so it's something so silly

772
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,960
because we're turning ability so hands

773
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,789
up how many people involved here in the

774
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,110
startup side are using technology in

775
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:21,920
education that's up I mean how many are

776
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:25,849
using it in compliance how many are

777
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,558
using it for medical processing okay

778
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,909
anybody else who wants to speak up I

779
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:31,549
mean we really are trying to encourage

780
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:33,230
technology companies to come forward and

781
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:35,210
talk about their experiences because we

782
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,009
can all learn from each other I mean I

783
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,920
will say that my experience here has

784
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:42,619
been actually to sort of use some of the

785
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,539
stigma around this plant to actually get

786
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:47,569
people to agree to start to use new

787
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,399
technology for example I mean if people

788
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:51,109
agree we on this narcotic and yes we

789
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,880
need to track it and no we can't really

790
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:55,129
do this because gdpr says we can't

791
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,040
follow this etc I think that that does

792
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:00,020
also create a new opportunity to apply

793
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:03,109
new technology in a new way to fix

794
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:04,759
problems that are affecting this

795
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:07,369
industry as it normalizes and

796
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:10,220
potentially other pieces of a larger

797
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:11,289
vertical have any of you had experiences

798
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,799
without that you would like to

799
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:17,289
I said I'd like to come back to you you

800
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,480
know what you stated about how there's

801
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,500
nothing new here guys I mean like at the

802
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,059
end of the day the tech there's

803
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,759
technology out there it's not about

804
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,740
reinventing the wheel it's about making

805
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,539
that little way much better way better

806
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,400
than what it is because here's the thing

807
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:32,139
like the technology we developed it was

808
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,850
really kind of out of multiple different

809
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,990
pieces we took the best of several

810
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:37,839
different pieces of technology that

811
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,250
worked in our field and infused it

812
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,500
together into something that's brand

813
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,880
spanking new right and the same thing

814
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,380
goes for a lot of these different

815
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,380
practices like you don't need to create

816
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:50,530
anything new even unless it's something

817
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,660
that has to be created you so encourage

818
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:54,639
guys to look out there and see and do a

819
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,200
lot of research because before you spend

820
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,000
all this money or your investor's money

821
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,289
for that matter on a lot of different

822
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,839
things that you that is already existing

823
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:03,279
just do a lot of research first because

824
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,169
there's a lot of things out there that

825
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,059
parties serve that purpose we were

826
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,890
seeing a merge of all these different

827
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:11,409
industries merged into the cannabis

828
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,540
industry from all different fields that

829
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,060
includes you know medicine that includes

830
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:18,190
technology that includes agriculture

831
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,720
that includes retail they include supply

832
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,580
chain tracking that includes all the

833
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,500
different logistics and transportation I

834
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:25,480
mean there's so many different things

835
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,230
happen globally that you're just going

836
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,029
to take from all those different

837
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,519
industries and then apply your own kind

838
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:32,259
of sort of style to it right and I also

839
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,329
want to um you know real quickly you

840
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:36,250
know talk talk about this hotel medicine

841
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:39,039
aspect of this or just working with

842
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,869
patients and gathering that data you

843
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,329
know I have a friend of mine his name's

844
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:44,799
dr. Len a he's based on Los Angeles if

845
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:46,720
you present a company called endo canna

846
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,680
health now what endo Kenneth Health does

847
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,870
is they take your 23andme data and

848
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,430
translated the information into what you

849
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:56,199
need for you what would work best for

850
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,480
you in terms of cannabis products right

851
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,799
what would work worse for you in terms

852
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,539
of causing stress or anxiety or

853
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,359
different things like that really really

854
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:06,549
cool technology but this way you're able

855
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:09,369
to get highly targeted patient data

856
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:11,049
that's that's that's really amazing and

857
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:12,399
so you know exactly what works for you

858
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,680
because what will work for one person

859
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,300
may not work for the other person right

860
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,890
so so we're not important to see that

861
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:19,599
it's pretty incredible and I'm gonna

862
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,028
jump into here right so the difference

863
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,248
in

864
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:23,989
privacy the approach to privacy from a

865
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:25,460
technology perspective is a very very

866
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:27,679
different depending on where you are I

867
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,440
mean if you're in California on with

868
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,879
Google and we don't care about privacy

869
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,710
and I'm gonna say that because they just

870
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:35,569
got the suit here and you're in France

871
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,548
they don't and I you know I think that

872
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:39,710
there is a wide opportunity here but I

873
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:41,898
think that that is one of the issues

874
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,909
that we see is that privacy and the

875
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:46,069
understanding of what privacy is aware

876
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:49,759
that data can go and who can have access

877
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:51,468
to that and why is a discussion that I

878
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,868
think the cannabis industry in general

879
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:56,088
and patients and doctors should step up

880
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:57,439
on I mean weird we're in that space we

881
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:58,969
don't believe that private companies

882
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,058
should have as much information about

883
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:04,190
people as they do and we see gdpr to

884
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:07,249
your point I think as it wayno setting a

885
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,109
much higher standard where patients

886
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:10,700
actually have control what they don't

887
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:13,118
and that in itself is something that we

888
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,798
can enable with the use of technology

889
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:17,358
while giving industry more information

890
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:19,608
that they ever possibly could have hoped

891
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:21,079
for but it is completely anonymized

892
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:23,749
because of the way that we approach it

893
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:25,898
so maybe that is one of the ways to talk

894
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:28,700
maybe we can talk about a bit about

895
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:30,618
privacy because I think this is a huge

896
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,788
huge discussion that it's not often

897
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:33,439
talked about because do you were like

898
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:36,679
gdpr doesn't matter it doesn't affect my

899
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,469
business in Germany or in Europe right

900
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:43,249
now and GDP are violation one to PR

901
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:45,769
violation they can ding you for percent

902
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:47,629
of global sales so if you think about

903
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:50,388
just a cannabis perspective of this

904
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:52,519
beyond the tactic a privacy as a medical

905
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:54,888
discussion should be baked into all of

906
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,378
us this particularly can hurt a company

907
00:32:54,888 --> 00:33:01,278
has small medical sales here in Germany

908
00:32:57,378 --> 00:33:03,138
but a global footprint for example so

909
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,969
how do you think that and I'm going to

910
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:06,798
maybe the end of this a little bit early

911
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:08,629
because I want to speed things up and

912
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:12,200
make sure this conference goes on but

913
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:15,168
how do you see technology influencing

914
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,580
the privacy conversation and I would say

915
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:18,559
if you want to add in the cannabis

916
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:21,648
industry fine but I think that

917
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,418
technology can be used to highlight that

918
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:24,869
so for example you're in you know are

919
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:27,000
you making plans to

920
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:29,579
people their own personal cloud access

921
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,349
for example or you know in your industry

922
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,879
or you think about the fact that yeah

923
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:35,099
I've got a you know ease are there

924
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,750
privacy aspects on the on the on the b2b

925
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:38,459
side that maybe we have a thought about

926
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,109
I mean I think that is from my

927
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,579
perspective that is where I spend a lot

928
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:43,589
of my time thinking and planning and

929
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,639
working but I don't know I just jump in

930
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,558
there because I mean what you just said

931
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,930
is so complex depending on where you are

932
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,000
so we conduct business in the u.s.

933
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:53,190
there's over 30 states that we're having

934
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,390
to deal with if you know we deal with

935
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:59,250
Canada we the data that we take from our

936
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,929
customers is not our data it's that we

937
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,210
put it into Azure it's your environment

938
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:04,920
in our model so the data is yours we

939
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,170
just have to help you manage it and in

940
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,039
Canada the data has to stay inside of

941
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,889
Canada

942
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,898
so as a technology company we have to

943
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,240
put platforms up everywhere that comply

944
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:16,980
to that requirement that really has

945
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,449
nothing to do with cannabis has more to

946
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,389
do with with the data side of it so

947
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:24,269
privacy relates to the consumer but it

948
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:26,909
also relates to your data everybody's

949
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:29,639
coming to us looking for aggregated data

950
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,470
on your business not just from what

951
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,909
you're selling to patients but you know

952
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,489
what products are selling it every other

953
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,869
industry has aggregated data that

954
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:38,219
they're looking at if you ended with if

955
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,769
you come from the hotel industry every

956
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,178
Hotel knows how busy this hotel was last

957
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:43,860
night what the occupancy was here as

958
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,809
compares to everybody else and what the

959
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,519
average room rate was and this industry

960
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:50,250
needs to know the same thing what

961
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,780
products should I be selling how much

962
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,398
how much does it cost me to produce that

963
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,960
product how can it be more efficient and

964
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,210
you have to share the aggregated data as

965
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,519
a community so that we we can all get

966
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,190
better on it so there's the privacy of

967
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,869
that information so we we don't give

968
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,250
that data it has to be you guys

969
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,380
providing that data amongst ourselves

970
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,469
and then a community setting itself up

971
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,579
where that aggregated data gets used

972
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:12,779
okay so I think we're being signaled

973
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,549
from the side here that we're running

974
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,410
out of time

975
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:22,170
last call for any questions you can

976
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:25,349
catch us later there is some there

977
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:28,590
Kerber botanics conversation is very

978
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:32,579
interesting because we launched our

979
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:35,190
online shop in the UK but the plan was

980
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:35,900
to produce two apps one for under who is

981
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,769
one

982
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:42,619
iOS and connect the chakra fly into the

983
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:45,079
app so when you sell a product we want

984
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:48,589
to capture the information from the

985
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:51,860
customer how they use it and how it can

986
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:55,250
help for us to choose the next next

987
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:57,800
product but the GDP or spin you talked

988
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,690
about is very interesting because you're

989
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,780
already starting to sell not just New

990
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:13,429
York air or Germany France how do we

991
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:16,580
sort of manage that later but yeah I

992
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:19,190
think I hope that the rule is privacy by

993
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:21,380
default or privacy by design and so you

994
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:25,309
have the tracking unit needs to be

995
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:27,050
disabled but you are able to ask your

996
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:29,210
client that shows the information it's

997
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,550
you it's still possible you just need to

998
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,150
say why you might want to the data be

999
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,769
collected

1000
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,450
what kind of Tidy I want to collect it

1001
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:37,369
and you need to ask for permission and

1002
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:39,199
you can do the same thing educational

1003
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:42,079
scales for it back to that's the other

1004
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,089
thing so it is compound yeah it's it's

1005
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,590
GPR sounds scary but it's quite simple

1006
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,390
as long as you give consent and there is

1007
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,100
a reason for you to have that consent

1008
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:50,869
which sounds like you want to provide

1009
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,610
better service your customers just build

1010
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:53,869
your privacy policy in a way that gets

1011
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,670
that consent and then you can do pretty

1012
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:57,650
much whatever you want as long as you

1013
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,909
define yourself as the data controller

1014
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,650
in that matter short answer is

1015
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:03,049
complicated any other questions and see

1016
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,670
you later - I have a quick question when

1017
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,940
you talk about AI and all these things

1018
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,650
how do you deal with implicit biases or

1019
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,599
the challenges you have of gathering

1020
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,550
quality information because you can make

1021
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,289
the smart machine but if you tell it

1022
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,010
dumb [ __ ] it's gonna be a dumb [ __ ] good

1023
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:17,960
question

1024
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,850
like you know target in garbage out I

1025
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,380
think that's right that's a basic right

1026
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:27,079
the expert evidence in the Vancouver

1027
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:31,090
dispensary case was that patients want

1028
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:34,340
to see the product smell the product

1029
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:36,650
like going to the grocery store buying

1030
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:40,280
your groceries so how do you deal with

1031
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:42,470
that you have a license to sell online

1032
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,910
Canada only allows that I think you in

1033
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:46,368
Shoppers Drug Mart yeah

1034
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:48,348
the ones who have it medical patients

1035
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:50,358
only get it in the mail and they

1036
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,730
complain that it's in the container they

1037
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:54,288
have to open it up sometimes there's

1038
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,510
some problem with if they send it back

1039
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:58,400
so delays than getting their medicine so

1040
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,920
that the evidence from the patients and

1041
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,289
an expert doctors emerges from the

1042
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,769
states was that this was a very

1043
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:09,440
important part of delivering medical for

1044
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:11,809
medical patients so not sure if the

1045
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,389
drone can come and drop down and give an

1046
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:16,819
option and go back up and you can think

1047
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:18,588
or how are you gonna deal with that

1048
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:20,150
well actually I'm sorry you know it but

1049
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:22,759
in Germany actually that's illegal so

1050
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:26,838
you have to go to the pharmacy and the

1051
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,789
medical I guess culture here I mean the

1052
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:30,679
our potatoes are trained to actually I

1053
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:32,599
mean that's why they want patients to go

1054
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,759
to the pharmacy to literally have the

1055
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:37,818
pharmacist who is trained in this hand

1056
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,530
over that drug but to your point there

1057
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,818
may be regulatory issues that say you

1058
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,619
can't do it as you're doing in Canada

1059
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,659
which affects another thing that seas to

1060
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:47,539
sail for example but then you're gonna

1061
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:49,639
also in terms of access issues if you're

1062
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:52,579
too sick to get to the pharmacy but

1063
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:55,009
those are places where technology can in

1064
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:58,430
fact begin to start to connect them but

1065
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:00,380
as we find privacy issues all are all

1066
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:03,588
the way along this because it's not just

1067
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,838
a product that you can buy like a

1068
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:08,239
regular commodity product this is still

1069
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,548
stigmatized so privacy is in the room

1070
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,048
and every single light I think it's

1071
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,489
gonna be based on preference how many

1072
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:15,079
people refer to have a dropship to your

1073
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:16,909
front door then okay but that'll never

1074
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:18,380
replace the retail experience are you

1075
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:19,399
going in there it's smelling different

1076
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,318
things the only thing it will do is

1077
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,480
enhance it right so we're seeing

1078
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:25,278
enhancement of that retail experience so

1079
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,990
and big Hoover's a lot different than

1080
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:28,608
Germany and that's the evolution for

1081
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:30,528
medical to retina we're seeing as well

1082
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:32,690
if you're coming from a North American

1083
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:34,760
perspective you're already going well

1084
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,710
isn't it just like alcohol and why can't

1085
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,869
you buy it and consume it like you do

1086
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,068
alcohol and the international students

1087
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:41,900
still talking about it medically and

1088
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:43,849
what is it and is it a medicine is it

1089
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,250
you pick it up in a pharmacy you can get

1090
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,720
it online so I think if you look forward

1091
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,789
a few years you're going to see that

1092
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,949
same change happen that's happening in

1093
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:54,589
North America as it tries to embrace it

1094
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:55,750
in a recreational analyst way and have a

1095
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:57,309
retail experience

1096
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,750
yep you don't sit to be web Canada I'm

1097
00:39:57,309 --> 00:40:00,639
sorry to drive you but in Canada it

1098
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,108
seems like the privacy aspect was not

1099
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,608
really brought up until it went into the

1100
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,369
recreational market which is an

1101
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:07,900
interesting twist I thought but but that

1102
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:10,809
question in regards to brick-and-mortar

1103
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,130
versus the e-commerce is we shouldn't

1104
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,900
even talk about it right it's the same

1105
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,460
question that was thirty years ago in

1106
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,829
regards to of 20 years ago University

1107
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,409
e-commerce in general and now you see II

1108
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:24,759
Congress growing endlessly and malls in

1109
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:26,679
the u.s. nothing to do with privacy was

1110
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,690
talking about the consumer experience of

1111
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:31,029
choosing a product without being able to

1112
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,429
touch smell and understand it and that's

1113
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,810
a classic question of you know we've is

1114
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:36,339
different and we're gonna go a little

1115
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:38,049
long because I'm getting passionate now

1116
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,450
lead is different than lumber or a

1117
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,769
blender right you don't have to smell of

1118
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:44,139
liquor you don't need to look at the

1119
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:45,489
crystals on a blender right you want to

1120
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:46,629
smell your weed you want to look at it

1121
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:48,608
you maybe want to talk to the person

1122
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,140
about the genetics if you want to know

1123
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:51,940
something about the grower and how it

1124
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:54,909
was growing it's all thoughts without

1125
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:57,220
any different always get that experience

1126
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:59,139
without so mature that's a maturity of

1127
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:00,669
the industry right because right now I

1128
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:02,049
think that's because inconsistent

1129
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,789
product might be coming through and you

1130
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,500
can't get the same experience listen you

1131
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,989
could give five different growers the

1132
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,460
same cut and come up with five different

1133
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:11,529
styles and five different smells of five

1134
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,300
different effects all from the same weed

1135
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:15,310
so it's really hard to you can get them

1136
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,010
out of why big a or a double block or

1137
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:19,449
whatever it's very hard to get different

1138
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:21,099
to make sure people are consistent the

1139
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:22,569
blue dream from one person is different

1140
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:24,160
than blue dream from another person and

1141
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,599
it's America and here's the other thing

1142
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,129
right so I mean I know that this

1143
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,960
discussion is saying if there's no prep

1144
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,300
work fewer privacy discussions in

1145
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,309
e-commerce but there are actually a lot

1146
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,900
it is there a question there was another

1147
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:37,920
poster I think what time is it though

1148
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,920
because we're running super late
