2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,039
um

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,519
yeah just uh i just want to give a big

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,759
round of applause to icbc i mean it

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,719
blows my mind that we can all sit in

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,560
this room and talk about weed you know

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,079
i come from a developing market from

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,079
south africa and it's still fairly new

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,118
to us in terms of the commercial space

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,719
but um

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,559
it's just fantastic to be able to be

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,839
with like-minded people who are really

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,038
trying to change the world let's not

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,759
forget that cannabis has the potential

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,280
to have a seismic impact on the world we

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,719
live in which is not in a good space

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,719
right now so we all carry a great

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,600
responsibility to try and make sure it's

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,160
as clean effective as possible and can

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,679

21

we are affiliates and you probably

91
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,919
learned that beginning of last month he

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,120
kind of delist

93
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,399
cannabis from the narcotic act

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,599
so he's created a new poll right now

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
so it's

96
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,878
you know become

97
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,639
a lot of smart

98
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,479
so now people can

99
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,039
can do whatever they want in about

100
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:47,039
canadians right now

101
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,919
but we are working on the new act is

102
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,560
under a draft period

103
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,158
he is one of the members of the

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,199
committee

105
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,840
so

106
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,399
within 30 days from now i think the bnu

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
act to control the cannabis

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
all right

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,560
thanks y'all it's fantastic everybody

110
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,798
embrace this

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
um i want to just get a quick snapshot

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,280
of how everybody's territory works uh

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,799
one of the things i when i first got

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,318
asked to facilitate this panel on

115
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,000
developing

116
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,079
cannabis industries i was expecting it

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
to be the uruguays and thailand and

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,160
mexico's unfortunately

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
ralph could not make this session from

120
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,560
mexico which is uh unfortunate but i

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,759
kind of perceived it to be

122
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
all the developing economies not putting

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,280
two together that you know from

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,439
developed economies but still developing

125
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,879
cannabis industries so just quickly from

126
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,000
a south african perspective at the

127
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,560
moment uh we can uh you can grow medical

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,759
cannabis for exports we have a very very

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
small

130
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,520
local patient market that's developing

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,560
through what's called a section 21

132
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,639
and then from 2018 you you're allowed to

133
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,759
grow and cultivate cannabis for personal

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,759
consumption

135
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,439
you also have a cannabis club on

136
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,800
but our legislation is a bit all over

137
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,399
the place and we're kind of trying to

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
figure it out as we go along

139
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,519
but from a commercial perspective you

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
know for those of you don't know south

141
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,519
africa has a very uh deep pedigree with

142
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
growing cannabis we've been growing it

143
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,639
for hundreds of years we're one of the

144
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
biggest exporters already on cannabis

145
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,079
very similar to mexico we've been

146
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,758
exporting illegally into europe just the

147
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,758
same as south america has been reporting

148
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,319
into north america and there's a lot of

149
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,240
conversations around south america

150
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,399
becoming a sort of official great basket

151
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,478
of cannabis into north america and

152
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,038
likewise africa to europe you know just

153
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,399
because of our growing conditions um and

154
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,319
the whole number of things we've

155
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,839
unpacked so that's kind of the stages in

156
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,000
our country at the moment so you know we

157
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,719
are here for business if anyone wants to

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
buy any weed come and speak to me um but

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,199
i want to just get a bit of

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
understanding of where the legal

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,240
framework is in uruguay at the moment

162
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,560
because you guys obviously were right in

163
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,319
front of opening legislation what's the

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,199
current status

165
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,159
of course thanks trenton um

166
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
let's see uruguay was the first

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,280
country worldwide

168
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
to legalize the cannabis for all areas

169
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,519
when in

170
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,879
several areas is recreational medicinal

171
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,079
and hemp

172
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,959
a legalizing the economies for

173
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,279
recreational purposes for uruguay

174
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:17,279
for being a small country between

175
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,279
argentina and brazil with just 3.5

176
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,478
million population

177
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,439
it was very difficult yes and

178
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,879
it was very encouraged from that in that

179
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,639
moment from the

180
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,279
development

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,240
we were called pirates from the

182
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:37,119
international country board

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,560
that was it's an interesting

184
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,478
story

185
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,720
but uh moved forward and has developed a

186
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,918
three ways of access to recreational

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,199
academies

188
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,038
that are

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
very

190
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,199
democratic

191
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,959
because you have the self cultivators

192
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
you have the clubs

193
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,478
and you also can purchase in the

194
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,959
pharmacies yes so you have the whole

195
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,519
spectrum of possibilities for you to

196
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,598
access through to canons also

197
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,359
you can grow cannabis for medicinal

198
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,879
purposes

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,120
where there you can make a thc with high

200
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,120
level flowers of course if you want to

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
export you have to be certified

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,478
you can make extracts pharmaceutical

203
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,800
products and there is also a hemp market

204
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,159
yes and production

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,720
of course as a literal country all the

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,919
companies have the aim to export

207
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,680
so all the companies are focused in

208
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,799
export

209
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,120
so

210
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,960
exporting to to europe

211
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,918
us but also south america because south

212
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,959
america it's a

213
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,000
440 million people in south america and

214
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,399
uruguay

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,519
is ahab yes it's between argentina and

216
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,519
brazil and gives companies a lot of

217
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,878
possibilities for that

218
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,120
it's very progressive that you've

219
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
managed to cover all the models so that

220
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,519
you know you've got this adult use

221
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,279
market as well thanks for sharing um

222
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,719
talk about australia we hear lots of

223
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,799
good things i mean i heard there were

224
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
200 000 patients a few weeks ago and now

225
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,720
you said there's almost 300 000 patients

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,759
you guys are moving very fast yeah

227
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,120
thanks so um it's a number of scripts so

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,800
the the

229
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
statistics that we're getting from the

230
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
therapeutic goods administration and the

231
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
office of drug control around the number

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,120
of scripts that have been written to

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,799
date or authorizations and

234
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
while we've had a bit of a movement from

235
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,359
people on special access moving across

236
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,039
to authorized prescriber in recent

237
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,959
months as that became easier something

238
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,519
with gp's under authorized prescriber

239
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,159
prescribing the total number of scripts

240
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,278
is heading towards 300 000. now

241
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:54,079
australia had a very slow start from

242
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:57,679
2016 when medicinal was legalized uh it

243
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,839
really was only towards the end of 2019

244
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,479
that we started to see a real change in

245
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,040
prescription patterns and authorizations

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,839
being improved and a huge amount of that

247
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,958
work comes down to

248
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,200
organizations especially like the

249
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,958
medicinal cannabis industry australia

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
which is the representative body for the

251
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,518
industry that just works so hard to

252
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,320
develop a relationship with the office

253
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,839
of drug control and the tga

254
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
to ensure that really sensible

255
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,720
legislation got through and that

256
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
we really would discuss with the office

257
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,200
of drug control the impact of that

258
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,200
legislation unintended consequences and

259
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
our industry had more knowledge about

260
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
cannabis than the office of drug control

261
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,599
did you know we were all out there

262
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,039
working with with the plants and working

263
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,759
with design so that really helped us to

264
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,120
then see a shift in

265
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,439
legislation

266
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,879
and a reduction in red tape for patients

267
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,920
and so from really late 2019 we've seen

268
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,000
a continual acceleration of prescription

269
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,199
much more ease of getting products for

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,958
patients

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
much greater volumes of product and

272
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,119
therefore the prices come down and this

273
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
is the thing that i think many other

274
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,360
jurisdictions can learn from australia's

275
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:15,359
you know 25 million people we're not a

276
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,320
massive population a really big country

277
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,200
but what we've been able to do by having

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,720
a steady consistent and evolving

279
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
evidence-based

280
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
regime

281
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
we've enabled the price to come down

282
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,159
more people to get access now it's not

283
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,399
perfect we've got a long way to go

284
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,480
but i spend a lot of time

285
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,879
in europe now and when i see the

286
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,560
struggles that are happening in the uk

287
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,759
where there's sort of nonsensical

288
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,919
application of legislation compared to

289
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,759
what we've been doing in australia

290
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,120
i'm actually super proud of our country

291
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,319
and i think the other thing that's been

292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,919
useful is that we've aimed to establish

293
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,320
a strong

294
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,159
industry that could produce high quality

295
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,519
gmp product because that's the standard

296
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,679
required

297
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
and therefore we can export that high

298
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,519
quality product we're now getting the

299
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,839
volumes and the scale to make the

300
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,759
product cheaper

301
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,680
and we're also then investing in

302
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,600
research and that's really important so

303
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,159
australia has a very good research

304
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,639
environment we have fantastic

305
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,000
opportunities through r d credits and

306
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,000
and

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
refunds so it's actual cash in your hand

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
as a company that money you've put into

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
research you get a large chunk of that

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,078
back which you can then reinvest into

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,039
research so we have a lot of clinical

312
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,639
trials

313
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,319
that's what doctors are requiring and i

314
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,759
think that's the strength of

315
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,920
our environment and then there's

316
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,639
industrial hemp which doesn't have any

317
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,240
access to licensing for cbd cbd strictly

318
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,759
strictly within medicinal

319
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,879
it sounds like you've advanced really

320
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,120
quickly i'm interested to know more

321
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,039
about the local market versus export

322
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
we'll get to that in a second uh tell us

323
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,199
about your land what's happening that

324
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,759
side yeah so in new zealand the

325
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,240
medicinal cannabis scheme came in in

326
00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:00,078
april of 2020 with a 18-month transition

327
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,159
period for

328
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,159
importers and local producers to be able

329
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,120
to meet the requirements

330
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,120
so

331
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,120
for producers in new zealand you need to

332
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,360
meet the gmp requirements

333
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,679
our gmp certificates are mutually

334
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,680
recognised as eugmp

335
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,799
you also need to hold a medicinal

336
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,719
cannabis

337
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,759
license as well for the steps in the

338
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,839
process where you're producing or doing

339
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,919
doing that research

340
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,639
new zealand is a small country we have

341
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,039
five million people our patient

342
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,919
population is growing quickly

343
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,799
so

344
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,078
we've seen a patient population of 30

345
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,958
000 and growing to 50 000 in the coming

346
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,359
year

347
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,479
so we're seeing month on month

348
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,120
uh six percent growth in patient numbers

349
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,759
so it's small when we compare that

350
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,759
patient growth trajectory to australia

351
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,399
which is a few years ahead of us the

352
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,720
trajectory is really similar so we look

353
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,799
from new zealand to australia to see how

354
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,200
the market is developing but also look

355
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,759
at what is happening around the world

356
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,399
and i think that while we are one of the

357
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,639
newest countries to enter into the

358
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,559
medicinal cannabis scheme there's a lot

359
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,440
of learnings we've been able to take

360
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,239
from

361
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,480
other markets around the world bringing

362
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,879
some of that talent into new zealand to

363
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,399
support our new zealand market and our

364
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,039
ramp up and that's been a really great

365
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,360
way to accelerate

366
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,958
um interesting thank you for sharing um

367
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,440
in terms of your your plans in thailand

368
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,000
is there is there a real focus on export

369
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,480
or are you trying to stimulate the local

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,879
market first what's what's your strategy

371
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,720
obviously you flooded the market plants

372
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,278
really kind of opened things up is there

373
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
a long-term strategy is export a big big

374
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,720
thing for thailand

375
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,958
yes uh

376
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
basically we are growers so

377
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,198
we

378
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,679
grow a lot of

379
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,919
candies in thailand

380
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,120
we did for have been doing that for a

381
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,599
year right now

382
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,919
so right now the

383
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,240
primary market is local

384
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,240
the buyer is the public hospitals

385
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,480
we haven't done anything in

386
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,959
recreation recreation yet

387
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,639
and we don't plan to i mean our company

388
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,359
so we're strictly

389
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,159
moving into uh medical cannabis

390
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,680
of course uh export is our

391
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,679
next top hit

392
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,559
but we are looking so

393
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,439
we need gscp we need gmp and so on and

394
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:36,078
so forth in order to export

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
we're working on that right now so gacp

396
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,319
should be around the corner

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,120
we've done sop already

398
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,519
so

399
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
i would say probably

400
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,879
will be in this year

401
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,879
and the next step will be eugmp

402
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,078
add a little bit because you talk about

403
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:57,519
the medical cannabis

404
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,679
we in thailand we have one department

405
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,198
for you know that goldman has for a long

406
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,319
time

407
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,799
they

408
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,480
use herbs

409
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,639
as medicine

410
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,199
so now cannabis

411
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,000
is one under the

412
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,000
the kind of herbs

413
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,959
we have a significant amount of

414
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,240
doctors

415
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,679
who use or utilize those

416
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,399
medicines

417
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,399
number of cannabis patients

418
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
still very low i think

419
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,360
a few thousand will be

420
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
but

421
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,000
hopefully that will grow up

422
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,600
in terms of your export markets so you

423
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,679
know from an african perspective we're

424
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,879
focused on europe south america is very

425
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,120
much about

426
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,519
the northern part of the hemisphere do

427
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,360
you guys have a specific region that

428
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,278
you're focused on trying to export your

429
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
cannabis into a particular place that

430
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,320
you've gotten by

431
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,838
um obviously europe yes because it's a

432
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,639
growing market

433
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,920
our advantage will be our cost

434
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,919
we

435
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,039
presented yesterday in the investor

436
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,759
group

437
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,360
i think our operation cost is about five

438
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,278
usn per

439
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,440
gram dry flour

440
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,439
so that's very low this is indoor okay

441
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,919
the main reason because of the

442
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,240
relies on the equator

443
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,278
so a lot of effort then just like

444
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,159
temperature like some nights

445
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,480
our daily sunlight is about nine hours

446
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,679
so you're talking about 12 12 is that's

447
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,039
three hour difference something like

448
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,559
that so we yes we move into

449
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,319
uh

450
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,879
target of europe we i don't think you

451
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,800
can export to u.s right now

452
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,879
so you the european market will be our

453
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,039
first goal yeah i heard yesterday you

454
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,639
said that you know one of your usps is

455
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,319
you have lots of sunshine and cheap

456
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,639
labor and i was like that's the same

457
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,879
thing we say yes i think so there's

458
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,560
obviously the competitive space that we

459
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,559
we need to and i want to talk about usps

460
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,958
across each territory in a second um

461
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,599
elizabeth just give me some insight into

462
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,038
is australia open for i mean i know we

463
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,599
are from south africa perspective

464
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,959
already exporting into australia um but

465
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,798
and you mentioned before we came on

466
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
stage that there is there's been a big

467
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,558
import market but now as the local

468
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,640
market is coming online there seems to

469
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,558
be a balance do you think that

470
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
eventually australia will have the

471
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,399
capacity to create all their own

472
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,798
medicinal cannabis or is there still a

473
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,519
market for developing countries

474
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,240
so looking at the licenses and the

475
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,879
production capacity then yes over time

476
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,200
if all of the licensed uh square

477
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,280
meterage gets built out then australia

478
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,519
absolutely would have the ability to

479
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,759
produce all of its own domestic animals

480
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,279
and also export so just to know a lot of

481
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,679
people don't realize that australia is

482
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,440
the largest exporter into the uk and

483
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,840
into germany so large amounts of

484
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,919
medicinal cannabis come from australia

485
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,519
and it's because it's gmp

486
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,400
it's ready to go

487
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,079
the certification process is

488
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
the same the standards are the same

489
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,279
they're recognized we don't have to have

490
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,279
german inspectors come out to australia

491
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,000
because they trust the inspectors that

492
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,240
we have in australia already so that's a

493
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,720
real advantage and we're seeing a lot of

494
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,798
diversification into dose forms because

495
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,880
there's so much research one of the ways

496
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,720
that companies because in australia you

497
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,480
can't advertise your medicinal cannabis

498
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,279
to patients

499
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
you

500
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,200
the differentiation is coming through

501
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,199
unique dose forms

502
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
rather than you know kind of branding

503
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,360
and

504
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,880
important feel

505
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,399
and so we're getting a lot of innovation

506
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,000
and because of our really good um r d

507
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,320
tax system

508
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,839
that means that you get a much better

509
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,279
return for your investment dollar in

510
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,279
australia than in many other places in

511
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,000
the world and you guys are importing a

512
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,480
lot of um you know gacp cannabis and

513
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,720
flipping it into gmp because uh you know

514
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,038
for for developing developing economies

515
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,279
if you look at eu gnp it's completely

516
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,558
out of our spectrum it doesn't make any

517
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,359
financial sense

518
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,798
so so that has been to start with so if

519
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,119
you can imagine when australia first

520
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,879
opened up medicinal cannabis there

521
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,279
weren't you know it's going to take two

522
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
three years before anyone would have a

523
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,359
license and be producing and so the

524
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,159
government allowed imported products to

525
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,359
not have to meet all the arms of the

526
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,440
therapeutic goods order 93 and 100 and

527
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,079
so you had products that were being made

528
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,798
under gpp or gacp in other parts of the

529
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,480
world coming in to meet that unmet need

530
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,918
but we're getting close to a position

531
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,000
now where that's not necessary and so um

532
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,799
the federal government announced um a

533
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,119
couple of months ago that from

534
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,639
july 2023 all products entering

535
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,798
australian month must meet the same

536
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,480
standards as products made in australia

537
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,319
so there'll be no more of this slipping

538
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,640
product in that is

539
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,720
made at a lower standard and then

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,160
upgrading it in australia or packaging

541
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,480
it or whatever to make it gmp

542
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,919
and that's really important because one

543
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,839
of the things in australia sets itself

544
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
apart not just in cannabis but if we

545
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,720
talk about food or we talk about other

546
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,200
medications

547
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,440
it's that you know uh ability to have

548
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,038
very high quality trusted products so

549
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
when other food products and medicines

550
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,640
going to asia or europe coming from

551
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,079
australia they're well regarded and what

552
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
we don't want to be seen as a place

553
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,480
where you could repackage things to make

554
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,919
them look gmp and get them out into

555
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,519
another market that's a shame we're

556
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,360
quite enjoying our relationship with you

557
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,119
so i'm so sorry

558
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,719
but fair enough you know i mean what it

559
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,239
means is developing economies that are

560
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
trying to get flower or whatever it is

561
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
art need to just up our game

562
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,919
um in terms of uh your do you have a

563
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,159
specific target region that you're

564
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,480
trying to push your canvas into and how

565
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,600
is that going well uruguay actually is

566
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,679
exporting

567
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,798
it's exporting to germany portugal

568
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,120
israel

569
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:47,759
and in hemp also it's exporting to

570
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,759
switzerland and started this year

571
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,839
exporting to ecuador

572
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:57,759
so mainly uh is focused as a

573
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,839
country with just 3.5 million is focused

574
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:04,400
on an export

575
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:06,798
and as a very qualified workforce

576
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,038
and it has companies with the

577
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,240
certification and

578
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,720
it's

579
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,960
it has done all the homework yes to have

580
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,960
a good product

581
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,319
but this is

582
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,360
the aim of all companies is export

583
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,839
do you think you know there have been

584
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,279
talks in certain regions of quotas that

585
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,599
are being said because obviously to some

586
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,279
degree you know as countries we protect

587
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,719
ourselves you know i mean there's no way

588
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,798
you're ever going to export into canada

589
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,880
right now you know they've got like tons

590
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:35,918
of stuff sitting around so do you think

591
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,200
that we're going to have to this

592
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,919
developing country is going to have to

593
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,279
really fight for our place um in these

594
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,799
uh these developed markets which

595
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,839
obviously are a lot more lucrative than

596
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,839
the last

597
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,440
historically has been an exporter of

598
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,798
commodities yes

599
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
and

600
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,839
we are seeing that in this case it's

601
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
happening more or

602
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:03,439
less same is exporting raw materials and

603
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:06,079
will be reporting finding finest product

604
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,320
yet also has developed pharmaceutical

605
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,199
products yes

606
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,279
but

607
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,558
in that way

608
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,038
we see that the euro will remove for for

609
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,240
for that for exporting raw materials

610
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,879
flowers

611
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,519
and

612
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,760
all of that for the countries and we

613
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,038
have a

614
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,558
we have potential to fight with the big

615
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,919
ones yes because i was saying that we

616
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,279
were the first one

617
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,960
so we have learned a lot in the way

618
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:41,918
yes and we see some countries that are

619
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,400
going back and forth yes with its

620
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,159
regulation and ui has

621
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,280
manually made

622
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,559
the homework very well in

623
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,480
that

624
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:53,519
my opinion

625
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,480
so

626
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,599
we have all in place to to to compete

627
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,120
with the business we've really

628
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,639
capitalized on your first group of

629
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,239
advantage i think it's very important to

630
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,919
know it was in the suture two weeks ago

631
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
which uh

632
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,919
as uh our american friends call it and

633
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,759
uh i was with governments and they were

634
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,159
just saying that they were first markets

635
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,759
in africa uh there was a huge buzz about

636
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
lesotho there's some amazing growing

637
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,440
conditions etc but then they didn't

638
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,639
capitalize on it at all so they've

639
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
completely fallen at the back of the

640
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,840
queue and they're trying to figure out

641
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,279
how they're back there so it is it does

642
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,879
take sort of a certain amount of

643
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,158
aggressive business to get out there and

644
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,679
build those channels and you guys always

645
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,679
had a great fun way to do that yes

646
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,960
of course the company always the

647
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,320
companies want to move faster yes

648
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,400
but

649
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,319
there will be regulation and the market

650
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,519
has moved maybe

651
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:46,399
not as fast that the companies expected

652
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,278
but safety that is very important

653
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,278
thank you carmen is there a market for

654
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,558
other countries to be shipping products

655
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,319
into new zealand or you're going to get

656
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,038
all from australia

657
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,200
so

658
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,440
in new zealand we do have some imported

659
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,120
products at the moment

660
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,360
those imported products actually are

661
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:08,319
much more expensive than the locally

662
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,319
produced products so prices

663
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,080
i

664
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,319
couldn't possibly comment

665
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,639
we'll take that as a yes okay so one of

666
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,200
the one of the earliest goals when we

667
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,360
entered market was to improve access and

668
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,278
affordability and we've been able to do

669
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,278
that compared to the imported products

670
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,400
which we're really proud of for our

671
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,558
patients

672
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,559
um but yeah there is an opportunity to

673
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,918
import into new zealand

674
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,759
our standards are relatively high from

675
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,240
those that have been trying to import

676
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,798
products already uh products that are

677
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,359
being accepted in australia or in

678
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,400
germany haven't been accepted yet in new

679
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,719
zealand

680
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,320
uh so it is something to look into and

681
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,240
really understand those regulations if

682
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,278
you did want to import

683
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,120
thanks

684
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,519
uh in terms of the thai markets i mean

685
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,439
you know you guys talk about medicinal

686
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,960
and that's obviously a focus

687
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,558
we all know that you know it's been

688
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,640
completely mind-blowing to be honest i

689
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,399
was at mary jane a few days ago and how

690
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,278
this cbd flower market has just

691
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,519
completely exploded you know with a very

692
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,880
well crafted flower

693
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,798
hash

694
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,559
and i'm also gathering that it's an

695
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,879
entry point so that most people do want

696
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,558
to go thc the reality is that we all

697
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,640
talk about medical cannabis but we know

698
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,278
the recreational market is huge and is

699
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,679
going to be massive you know um have you

700
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,519
guys considered that that there will be

701
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,200
a recreational market in thailand if

702
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,960
you've got models you know have you

703
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
looked at the club model like so so the

704
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,798
responsible apple use is there any

705
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,000
narrative around that at the moment or

706
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,400
are you just focusing on on medical

707
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,679
for company we're just focusing on the

708
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,919
medical

709
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,278
but for the country

710
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,720
i cannot

711
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,159
really

712
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,600
give you the

713
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,080
perfect answer

714
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,439
but for my opinion right now

715
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,859
this

716
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,059
is from this psychology

717
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,059
[Music]

718
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,000
so they will probably

719
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,000
already approve for the

720
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
medical cannabis

721
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,839
um

722
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,240
okay

723
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,918
so that's that's that's what i'm

724
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
explaining to you

725
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,000
on top of that what what internal

726
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,278
markets i think we

727
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,240
expect a lot of countries in asia

728
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,558
that will open for medical cannabis but

729
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,960
not open for growing

730
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,519
in the near future and that's a big

731
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,440
market for example like japan

732
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,079
and china

733
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,798
they have a movement to allow a patient

734
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,720
to use cannabis but not growing so

735
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,158
that's a big big opportunity for us to

736
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,079
move into it

737
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,240
and what do you think your your unique

738
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,599
selling point what are the advantages so

739
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,159
if you have to stand there with a whole

740
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,678
lot of other countries why should the

741
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,360
cannabis industry be interested in

742
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,919
catholics about product what are the

743
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,558
reasons how would you sell cannabis to

744
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,919
the to the general world

745
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,440
well i i think

746
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,000
i still

747
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,840
look at cannabis as a normal business

748
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,798
it's not totally different from other

749
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,678
businesses

750
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,798
according to my my opinion

751
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,640
so

752
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,639
first of all the quality of the product

753
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,480
we

754
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,079
doesn't have to grow

755
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,440
international strength

756
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,398
we have our own uh strain address yeah

757
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,278
and and

758
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,599
that

759
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,720
very high txt also

760
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:35,038
so we're talking about 20 25

761
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,240
if we do it properly

762
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,879
so that's how

763
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,038
our advantage

764
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,600
the second one is cost

765
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,319
so if you have good product with a lower

766
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,918
cost you can save anything

767
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,678
yeah absolutely i mean that's been the

768
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,520
word on everyone's lips is the cost you

769
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,440
know yeah and you guys obviously have

770
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,200
the sun so you can grow outdoor or

771
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,440
hybrid tunnels which is a lot more cost

772
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,120
effective um what are you guys growing

773
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,120
predominantly outdoors

774
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:06,000
no no for medicinal purposes it's a

775
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,479
greenhouse or indoor the

776
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,640
two possibilities you can grow also

777
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,880
outdoor but the companies have decided

778
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
to use that two months so what are some

779
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,799
of your u.s pieces of territory why

780
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,159
should you care about cannabis with your

781
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,519
mind well first of all

782
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,080
uruguay

783
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,798
is a hub it's between argentina and

784
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:31,519
brazil so if you want to enter a south

785
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:35,119
america yes as i said a continent of 440

786
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:37,759
million people yes you're why it's a

787
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,398
very good option first of all

788
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,720
second it's a

789
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,719
country that in south america has a

790
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,839
stability institution and it's more

791
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,679
important it's the

792
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,639
the country with less corruption

793
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,038
levels

794
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,799
and it has the investment grade but it's

795
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,278
also very important

796
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,759
also gives tax exemptions for the

797
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,798
company and have for the companies and

798
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,798
has qualified workforce and is the

799
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,038
second country worldwide yes in

800
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,200
renewable energies

801
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,319
and we also have the government

802
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,960
supporting yes our sector

803
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,599
in fact they would stand here the

804
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,079
uruguayan government yes they stand in

805
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,439
this expo to

806
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,599
invite investors to come to ui and

807
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
producing in europe

808
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,798
tell me when we come we talk about

809
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,440
developing economies we often talk about

810
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,359
the financial benefit of cannabis to the

811
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,720
people on the ground uh it's a big

812
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,719
challenge in south africa at the moment

813
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,159
you know we have um we have farmers that

814
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,480
have been growing campus for hundreds of

815
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,480
years who are still criminals who have

816
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
been growing cannabis to feed their kids

817
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,319
and to send their kids to school

818
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,799
who are to serve our technically

819
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,879
criminals and then we have big farms

820
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,278
that have a lot of capital invested into

821
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,039
them who can grow cannabis legally who

822
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,720
are not criminals so we have this

823
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,158
complete justice position between you

824
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,480
know the people who have actually put

825
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,320
cannabis on the map and are still unable

826
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,839
to do that so our licensing situation is

827
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,398
very very complex

828
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,240
does the uruguayan government recognize

829
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,959
that cannabis needs to be able to filter

830
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,558
down to build the economy and to also

831
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,798
filter down to the lower levels of the

832
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,639
economic spectrum or is it just really

833
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,980
focused on bringing as much cash in as

834
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,200
possible no no

835
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,519

2013 14 and 15 and over i would say

840
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,759
a has seen the the kind of sector as an

841
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,080
industry yes that

842
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,960
brings possibilities for

843
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,599
all the spectrums of the society not

844
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,640
only for the big companies yes you have

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,679
owners yes that invested 20 30 000

849
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,158
for

850
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,360
cbd flowers for example for for

851
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,440
exporting that's accessible exactly yes

852
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,918
well what about in thailand no i mean

853
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,759
you do you have a strong

854
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,440
mandate from government to make sure

855
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,278
that the people on the ground also

856
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,519
benefit from cannabis

857
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,000
yes they do um

858
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,759
i would like to classify it to treat

859
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,480
categories right

860
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,079
so one is a major player big player like

861
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,839
what we are doing

862
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,319
and the second one is the

863
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,720
they allow any household

864
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,839
to grow up to 10

865
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
plants

866
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,519
per household

867
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,919
but again you guys know better than the

868
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,599
growing cannabis to have flowers not

869
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,759
easy at all

870
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,240
so

871
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,079
in real life i don't know that they can

872
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,919
do commercially

873
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,678
you know and what can they do with those

874
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,799
ten classes they can do they can do

875
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,840
whatever they want to sell it they can

876
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,798
they cannot sell it they can consume it

877
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,359
okay

878
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:00,240
um and then there's a

879
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,319
gap in between which is the like the

880
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,038
underground who used to

881
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,319
have experiences to grow and now they

882
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,119
are legal

883
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,558
so that that can be like sme for me

884
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,959
you know who

885
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,038
who grow cannabis

886
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,960
a small amount but they can they know

887
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:20,079
exactly how to do it and

888
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,159
and sell it so we have three categories

889
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,398
right now so it is filtering down and

890
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,240
trickling down those opportunities

891
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:32,000
government even

892
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,000
announced to give away a million plants

893
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,519
[Applause]

894
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,640
where did you get a million clocks

895
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,798
because the government yeah nicole no

896
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,720
they they have seeds

897
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,359
but again it's fantastic as you guys

898
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,519
know growing cannabis is not easy so it

899
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,199
depends on but be interested to see how

900
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,159
many of those million plants actually

901
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,159
survive and go to flowers

902
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:00,649
[Music]

903
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,240
you guys are in completely different

904
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,639
economies so i guess the narrative

905
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,120
around the bottom layers of people is

906
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,038
not such so prevalent but but is there

907
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,719
access is it an exclusive kind of

908
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,720
industry where you need lots of dollar

909
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,640
to get in or or can you find that

910
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,278
there's a general sort of access people

911
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,679
have access generally so from the

912
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,398
industry the commercial perspective yes

913
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,000
this is an industry that requires uh

914
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,319
expertise

915
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,440
understanding of both agriculture and

916
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,079
gmp

917
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,480
and the costs of facilities uh you know

918
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,119
are very pricey um and then they're

919
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,440
long-term investments um the one thing i

920
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,959
will say uh from australia is that under

921
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,919
our constitution

922
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,840
uh things like personal use of something

923
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,919
like cannabis actually falls under state

924
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,480
legislation isn't in the remit of the

925
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,000
federal government and any time that

926
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,759
representatives federal government are

927
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,319
asked about this they'll say well it's a

928
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,679
matter for the states and so we've seen

929
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,558
the ict

930
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,000
has

931
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:08,159
legalized personal use personal growing

932
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,679
of cannabis for personal use they've

933
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,280
legalised that

934
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,398
a number of states have decriminalized

935
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,399
and i think

936
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,838
last week or might be this week in

937
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,239
western australia they're having a

938
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,159
debate about it in parliament

939
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,319
and so there is that kind of harm

940
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,039
minimization

941
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,079
and

942
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,159
um

943
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,480
kind of recognition of

944
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,919
kind of the ubiquity of cannabis within

945
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,639
australian society i think we actually

946
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:35,118
have almost the highest personal usage

947
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,000
of cannabis of anywhere in the world

948
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,919
um so you know a bunch of stones

949
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,159
well i i

950
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,579
i can't comment but you know maybe maybe

951
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,519
that's why we're so easygoing

952
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:47,039
[Music]

953
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,239
but from the from the medicinal

954
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,559
perspective um you know even our

955
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,039
supplement industry you know has very

956
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,440
high standards and so our nutraceuticals

957
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,358
and our food supplements

958
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,800
uh vitamins and minerals are always

959
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,078
produced are really high standard and

960
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,519
they're recognized around the world as

961
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,039
being you know really high quality

962
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,960
products and so

963
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,400
from when the law was changed the law

964
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,838
was changed because there were patients

965
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,680
in need who were dying or in severe pain

966
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,320
really suffering and their families got

967
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,480
together to really lobby the government

968
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,880
and got into the media and so we always

969
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,440
remember in australia that

970
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,200
we were begun by patients and

971
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,599
the whole idea of strengthening the

972
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,199
australian industry is to get that price

973
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,559
down and certainly why i started my

974
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,480
company was to do whatever i could to

975
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,039
help the industry to get to a place

976
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,760
where it could compete with the

977
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,039
non-regulated market and the floor price

978
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,760
for

979
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,759
licensed medicinal cannabis in australia

980
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,599
is now the same as the

981
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,520
price of the black market

982
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,960
so i think we've done extremely well

983
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,199
there now there are more expensive

984
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,720
products there's a whole spectrum but i

985
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,039
think we have almost the widest choice

986
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,039
of products in medicinal

987
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,559
medicinal varieties that don't when we

988
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,480
don't have a commercial recreational

989
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,000
market so there's a lot of choice for

990
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,358
patients lots of different ways they can

991
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,599
take the product

992
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,519
it's becoming much more personalized and

993
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,920
we're starting to see interest now some

994
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,079
of the work that um the medicinal campus

995
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,240
industry australia's been doing has been

996
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,400
to reach out through healthcare

997
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,319
practitioner and patient groups

998
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,320
to talk to the colleges of general

999
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,680
practice and specialist colleges and

1000
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,920
we're starting to now see movements

1001
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,319
towards education being developed by the

1002
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,240
colleges specific to medicinal cannabis

1003
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,599
and that's going to that's really what

1004
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,078
we're going to see a lot more doctors

1005
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,760
feeling comfortable prescribing

1006
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
obviously you've always got the bleeding

1007
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,800
edge doctors and the leading edge

1008
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,480
doctors

1009
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
but the more mainstream doctors will

1010
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,358
require that education and so that's a

1011
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,079
real focus of the industry

1012
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,078
and the industries organizations and the

1013
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,160
various patient groups in australia to

1014
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,720
get really well educated doctors at the

1015
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,118
end of cannabinoid system recognized you

1016
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,519
know within teaching schools and and

1017
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,119
continuing education programs i think

1018
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,719
that's essential everywhere but it's

1019
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,920
part of the evolution as the market

1020
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,919
matures

1021
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,720
and you know at first australia was

1022
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,599
pretty much just all oils and sublingual

1023
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,078
oils

1024
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,200
now there's you know i think 140

1025
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,839
different

1026
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,000
methods of taking the product in

1027
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,559
australia and we've also shifted from

1028
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,838
being predominantly processed products

1029
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,759
now to um high quality flower products

1030
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,199
um taking more and more of the market

1031
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,119
share

1032
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,960
thanks for sharing that um in terms of

1033
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,400
new zealand there are

1034
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,079
in developing economies you've got lots

1035
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,280
of parallel industries you know so if

1036
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,800
you've got a developed pharmaceutical

1037
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,240
industry or an agricultural industry

1038
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,839
it's a lot easier to pivot and bring on

1039
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,319
these new sort of uh

1040
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,799
areas um how does that mean an advantage

1041
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,599
in new zealand people capitalize on that

1042
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,200
as an advantage yeah one thing that's

1043
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,760
great about new zealand is that we have

1044
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,838
a really really strong horticulture and

1045
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,839
agriculture background

1046
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,480
we have a lot of innovation in this

1047
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:01,440
space that is being able to come across

1048
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,400
from other crops so from kiwi fruit from

1049
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,639
pinus radiata around tissue culture

1050
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,680
around light treatments

1051
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:12,078
so we're able to use that right now

1052
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,078
as we're entering into the industry i

1053
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,079
think that collaboration and that

1054
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,640
opportunity is really exciting for what

1055
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,880
we're building in new zealand and a key

1056
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,159
way of us being able to accelerate our

1057
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,440
pathway

1058
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,679
one of the other things that you were

1059
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,440
speaking out about before as well is

1060
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,960
just that licensing

1061
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,800
raging and how it filters down through

1062
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,639
so we have some of the

1063
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,320
larger companies like helios um

1064
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,719
which are vertically integrated but

1065
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,119
there is also over 40 cultivation

1066
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,719
licenses in new zealand

1067
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,880
and that can range from very large

1068
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,439
cultivation spaces like we have a

1069
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,079
strategic partnership with puro

1070
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,240
who grow on the beautiful kaikoura coast

1071
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,599
two very small boutique

1072
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,838
cultivators

1073
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,079
and we partner at helios with some of

1074
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,039
those small boutique cultivators for

1075
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,119
their

1076
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,838
biomass which we then take through our

1077
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,559
extraction process to get the unique

1078
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,239
terpene and full spectrum profile

1079
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,838
so i really like the fact that we're

1080
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,598
able to work with small boutique

1081
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,920
cultivators large cultivators we also

1082
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,000
have our indoor growing space

1083
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,440
at the site that we can use for high

1084
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,119
quality dried flower so a real range and

1085
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,960
a lot of that through the collaboration

1086
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,640
and the focus on innovation in

1087
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,639
horticulture using existing

1088
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,358
infrastructures essentially

1089
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:36,000
yeah absolutely existing infrastructure

1090
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,319
also existing research at the

1091
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,838
universities so we have some strong

1092
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
agricultural

1093
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,759
universities that are doing research in

1094
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,000
this space that

1095
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,320
can see the opportunity for the industry

1096
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,920
for students who are graduating and so

1097
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,200
those students are doing research and

1098
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,358
then feeding

1099
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,358
not only our product pipeline but also

1100
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,880
our talent pipeline as the industry

1101
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,960
matures

1102
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,559
thanks for that i mean in terms of the

1103
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,159
the thai market you've obviously got

1104
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,679
certain industries that are more

1105
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,679
developed than others

1106
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,519
have you identified industries within

1107
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,279
thailand that you think will embrace and

1108
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,519
help the cannabis industry move forward

1109
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,040
you know whether in pharmaceutical or

1110
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,440
agricultural or you know product

1111
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,239
development

1112
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,159
right now there's a few big projects

1113
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,279
going around

1114
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,039
which i can

1115
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,480
give you information for

1116
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,000
some of them one of one of them who

1117
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,719
plan to use

1118
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,079
part of cannabis plants

1119
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:36,719
to be become a chicken food

1120
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,400
they have research in thailand and they

1121
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:43,199
found that chicken after they have

1122
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,639
that probably cannabis leaf

1123
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,000
the chicken

1124
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:51,480
become more calm and lay eggs

1125
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,480
so that would be

1126
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,440
the other one also comes from the huge

1127
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,920
company

1128
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,880
they plan to open satellite cleaning

1129
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,358
using canopies

1130
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,480
that's why i love it so much i mean they

1131
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,119
plan to

1132
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,280
become using like csr for the one who

1133
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,559
cannot you know afford for price

1134
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,599
that's a good project moving on also

1135
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:27,759
and i i think i agree with her that

1136
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,760
to educate market is very important

1137
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:34,318
not only in school but you know

1138
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,400
country-wide because

1139
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:38,159
i almost believe that in any every

1140
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,318
country when you announce

1141
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,078
legalized cannabis they'll be pro-income

1142
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,920
i mean against

1143
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,720
a lot of people will say no

1144
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,599
but if we can educate market and let

1145
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,838
them

1146
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,079
realize the benefit of

1147
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,078
this

1148
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,969
education and educate markets

1149
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,969
[Music]

1150
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,679
um thanks for that i just wanted to

1151
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,280
quickly uh i want to take some questions

1152
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,919
out of the time i just wanted to quickly

1153
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,839
go through the the panel um where is

1154
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,838
industrial impact in your territory

1155
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,159
[Music]

1156
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:15,039
are you growing industry

1157
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,838
yes

1158
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:21,838
an industrial hemp actually is grown for

1159
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:24,159
cbd flowers yes and the market for the

1160
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,159
grain is under development there are two

1161
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:29,039
or three projects big projects under

1162
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,239
development but the industry of camp has

1163
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,199
developed

1164
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,959
in the market of the city

1165
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,039
australia

1166
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,920
yeah we have a strong industrial hemp

1167
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:42,000
sector in 2018 australia new zealand

1168
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,519
under the food standards australian new

1169
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,480
zealand act

1170
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,199
allowed

1171
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,079
hemp seeds to become a food

1172
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,519
and

1173
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,519
that means that you know health food

1174
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,519
stores have all sorts of hemp products

1175
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,318
we don't have an mcbd

1176
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,280
market cbd is either a schedule 3 or

1177
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:01,039
schedule 4 product in australia but the

1178
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,720
separation's actually worked really well

1179
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,318
because there's been no confusion for

1180
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:07,039
hemp farmers they know they're building

1181
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,838
either for industrial purposes or for

1182
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,599
food or for food for animals or for

1183
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:16,000
human consumption fibre fabric etc um

1184
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,400
and so there's been the farmers haven't

1185
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,159
kind of been lured by the promise of cbd

1186
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,838
flower and then forgotten all the

1187
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,279
fantastic environmental benefits of

1188
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,039
industrial have

1189
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,119
yeah absolutely and

1190
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,679
yeah so in new zealand um industrial

1191
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,559
hemp is available for food and fibre

1192
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,559
yeah

1193
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,838
that's good to hear we do have him also

1194
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,358
yes okay

1195
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:36,880
what's the focus for him today is it

1196
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,679
textile because obviously you've got a

1197
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,680
good industry style um

1198
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,879
maybe it takes time right now yes yeah

1199
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,440
because i mean you know we obviously

1200
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,119
will talk about the sort of you know thc

1201
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,119
cannabis which is more the sexy side you

1202
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,960
know but at the end of the day you know

1203
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,240
what as i started to learn more about

1204
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,480
hemp a few years ago the the the ability

1205
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,118
for all the the capacity for him to have

1206
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,880
us a positive impact on our environment

1207
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,960
is completely mind-blowing

1208
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,039
so we all we often get stuck in the in

1209
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,318
the high thc conversation but i started

1210
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,838
to touch and see where each territory is

1211
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:09,599
at so it's really encouraging to hear

1212
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,679
that there is hemp running in parallel

1213
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,838
to that guys we've got five minutes left

1214
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,440
so if there are any questions

1215
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:16,639
if you could put your hands up and this

1216
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,000
gentleman here will bring you a

1217
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,078
microphone

thank you so much i'm dr shakesha campus

1221
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,280
condition from south africa well done

1222
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,800
friends and my brother

1223
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
and for the panel so my question is

1224
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,079
there's an emerging markets guys what

1225
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,559
are your views

1226
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,318
on regulating the plants okay so we

1227
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,078
don't regulate poppy and we make more

1228
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,239
feed that can kill people

1229
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,599
we don't regulate tobacco and we don't

1230
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,598
tell the doctors don't tell your

1231
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,318
patients how many cigarettes to smoke

1232
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,000
but we don't regulate that either i just

1233
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,838
want to know as coming into the industry

1234
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,719
what are your views on regulating the

1235
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,880
plant instead of the end products are we

1236
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,239
looking at changing the narrative and

1237
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,680
looking at things differently i just

1238
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,118
want to understand what your views are

1239
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,960
thank you

1240
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,720
do you want to start yeah so in

1241
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,119
australia we do regulate the plants so

1242
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,279
we do regulate poppy and we do regulate

1243
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,519
tobacco so we don't just regulate the

1244
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,359
end product so australia was a big

1245
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,159
producer of

1246
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:26,480
opiates at least the the apis that went

1247
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,920
on to be become other things

1248
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,079
and especially down in places like

1249
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,639
tasmania and so

1250
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,160
it is a controlled crop so it's not that

1251
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,400
there weren't any regulations the other

1252
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,118
thing too is that when you look at

1253
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,960
a poppy um it's not so easy to take that

1254
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,880
popping yourself in in your kitchen and

1255
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,480
turn it into a drug and most people who

1256
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,039
do die

1257
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,159
and so it's quite different to the

1258
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,519
ubiquity of the uses of the plant

1259
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:52,879
growing in the fields and growing in

1260
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,679
someone's backyard

1261
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,079
but

1262
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,759
taking off my australian hat and looking

1263
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,318
at you know from my international

1264
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,880
relations background harmonisation is

1265
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,199
really important and the use of

1266
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,838
regulation to impoverish and imprison

1267
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:10,078
people is a global shame

1268
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,559
of this period and we need to do

1269
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,400
everything we can to remediate that

1270
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:18,400
situation and also to to ensure that we

1271
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,000
don't put people into health poverty

1272
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,079
that's one of i was born with a really

1273
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,519
rare disease my parents sold everything

1274
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,000
to keep me alive

1275
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,920
and so i'm here again 57 years of age

1276
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,599
when my parents were told

1277
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,599
at two that i was going to die and there

1278
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,680
was nothing that could be done and they

1279
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,440
spent every cent they had ever since

1280
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,159
they saved every cent they could borrow

1281
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,400
and took me to italy to get surgery that

1282
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,199
saved my life and then at 12 i had four

1283
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,000
strokes and they were told again so

1284
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,960
for me health poverty is an enormous

1285
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,679
issue

1286
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,318
and it's not you can't fix that by

1287
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,879
saying grow your own plant because

1288
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,318
families with very ill children

1289
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,480
can't make the medicine that their

1290
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:59,519
children need in most cases not all

1291
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,240
cases

1292
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,280
they need to trust supply that's high

1293
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,639
quality

1294
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,640
that is consistent that they can trust

1295
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,279
that is and that isn't going to bankrupt

1296
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,960
them so that's why i got into this and i

1297
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,960
i know a lot of the other ceos in

1298
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,440
australia and they all have similar

1299
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,720
stories of family members and and really

1300
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,639
compassionate reasons why they got

1301
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,558
involved thanks for sharing that story

1302
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,078
um it's uh it's very interesting how

1303
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,480
many people are in the campus industry

1304
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,559
who have stories to tell ultimately and

1305
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,559
what's incredibly important prohibition

1306
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,839
partners uh the recent global report

1307
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,359
they put out and we were quite

1308
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,199
disappointed because africa got quite a

1309
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,960
small mention but one of the things they

1310
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,279
talked about was the fact that

1311
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,838
the african uh markets are purely

1312
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,839
focused on export um so getting our

1313
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,000
medicine to other people but not looking

1314
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,358
after our own people uh and you're quite

1315
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,280
right i mean if you look at the cbd

1316
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:51,358
market it's completely for our populist

1317
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,040
unaffordable you know it's a tiny tiny

1318
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:54,719
segment of population

1319
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,079
and i think that is a massive massive

1320
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,000
issue the other thing is about

1321
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,599
regulating when you regulate in an

1322
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,280
advent developed economy you know

1323
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,880
there's an argument to be said that you

1324
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,720
don't regulate your cultivation in

1325
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,838
regulator processing and distribution

1326
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:07,598
you know because we've been trying to

1327
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,838
stop people growing in their backyards

1328
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,440
for decades and decades and never worked

1329
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:12,558
so there's all these models that i think

1330
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,400
are needed

1331
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,640
in different countries for different uh

1332
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,680
different different dynamics you know uh

1333
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:21,279
any other questions i think we can

1334
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:23,440
probably tell you one more yes sir

1335

1347
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,039
attention in reference to

1348
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:59,358
can you unpack that a little bit more so

1349
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:01,199
so ultimately one of the usps of a a

1350
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:04,480
developing economy that has good

1351
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:07,279
sunshine is obviously our light you know

1352
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:11,358
so if we if we start to grow indoor

1353
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:14,000
uh the cost of processing is is

1354
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:16,400
similar to growing in canada or europe

1355
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,039
you know because it's indoor uh yes we

1356
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,480
have low low cost in electricity and low

1357
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:24,000
labor costs um but as efficiency in the

1358
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,920
international market increases and the

1359
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,838
cost per gram comes down because of

1360
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,838
economies of scale et cetera

1361
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,799
the opportunity to compete price point

1362
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:34,480
wise on an eu gmp level is i don't

1363
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,960
believe it's long-term sustainable we

1364
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,880
need to i believe in our territory to

1365
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,559
grow medical cannabis that growing

1366
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,480
tunnels hybrid tunnels is the best way

1367
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,400
forward because you get utilization of

1368
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,079
the sun but you also will growing in a

1369
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,760
controlled environment so i think that's

1370
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,240
one of the biggest challenges is we only

1371
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,640
can't sell light for light we need to

1372
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,358
look at the strategic advantages we have

1373
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,719
from our territory from our sunlight

1374
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:57,920
and all those other elements we need to

1375
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,358
figure out what the best thing is the

1376
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,280
other problem at the moment

1377
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,759
from a south african perspective is the

1378
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,519
tail wagging the dog so we are being

1379
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,079
dictated and converted to commerce by

1380
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,400
the international markets who want a

1381
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,640
particular thc level or particular

1382
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,920
strains growth so i would like to see

1383
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,159
developing markets you know like

1384
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,838
yourself as uh being able to come to

1385
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,399
events like this and go this is what we

1386
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:23,199
grow this is how we grow this is our

1387
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,200
cost per gram and and sell the cameras

1388
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,598
based on what we are developing as

1389
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:29,279
opposed to being told

1390
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,359
the other fear we have is you know

1391
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,800
exporting raw products uh and then

1392
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,239
importing product back into our

1393
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,000
economies which we've been doing for

1394
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,598
decades especially in africa you know

1395
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,838
and that just can't happen because that

1396
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,359
makes no commercial sense so i hope that

1397
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:42,639
answers your question

1398
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,239
all right i think you have time for one

1399
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,318
more question

1400
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:49,439
one more question guys one more question

1401
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:53,639
anyone have any hands up

1402
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,639
no all right everyone

1403
