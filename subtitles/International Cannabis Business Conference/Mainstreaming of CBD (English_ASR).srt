1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,580
okay it sounds good right now there's a

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,059
lot of uncertainty in CBD we're kind of

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,780
facing some uncertainty with the FDA we

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:14,308
got a legal farm bill my three panelists

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,989
today are gonna help us kind of figure

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,189
out some of the patchwork of what's

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,910
going on out there on the federal level

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,800
here everyone's looking at CBD is a big

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,740
opportunity I think everyone in this

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,140
room has some connection to cannabis CBD

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,459
is sort of popped up in the last you

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,170
know few months as a federal

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,820
legalization and farm bill is come

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,230
around and I think a lot of us are

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,730
finding ourselves now kind of running

16
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,319
parallel businesses and trying to figure

17
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,909
out how we take advantage of what they

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,820
think is going to be a twenty two

19
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,890

of clued me in that this industry was

56
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:25,369
rapidly developing and it dawned on me

57
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,049
that I should figure out how to take my

58
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,688
skills from those other industries and

59
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:31,879

strategies for in this industry for how

70
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:58,069
to work within this complex legal system

71
00:02:54,408 --> 00:03:02,120

Switzerland two days ago

99
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,949
Switzerland is the country that's known

100
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:16,608
for chocolate the Alps and more recently

101
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:18,709
wheat its cannabis CBD cannabis i'm from

102
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,418
the breeding company under managing this

103
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,639
one but i'm representing the holding

104
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,649
which is a it's going to be an

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
interesting topic after it's fully

106
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:28,959
integrated to holding

107
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,709
varieties breeding all the way to the

108
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,479
sales were selling from Switzerland to

109
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:37,060
you to European Union but also

110
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,140
internationally were the biggest company

111
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,699
in Europe we started two years ago it

112
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:47,949
all took off and now we're selling

113
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,949
flowers flowers a cessation products

114
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,920
we're selling dietary supplements CBD

115
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:56,670
oils and we're doing white labeling

116
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,740
private labeling bulk orders worldwide

117
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:03,220
that's the story from my side looking

118
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,900
forward to this talk cool I think a

119
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,030
first question I want to start with is

120
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,469
for you two gentlemen who are in the

121
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,539
production end of this business and I

122
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,920
think audience might be curious about

123
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,700
sort of what products you guys are

124
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,680
producing what's selling well and sort

125
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:20,069
of the diversity of products and CBD

126
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,000
that you guys work with specifically

127
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:27,759
sure so CBD is like you've mentioned

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,079
early just this burgeoning business so I

129
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,849
think a lot of different products are

130
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,680
still being created out there what we're

131
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,000
focused on is dietary supplements to

132
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,180
help people take it in their day to day

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,949
life and invest in their health and find

134
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,889
ways to take CBD that fit into their

135
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:43,990
normal everyday life the powdered or the

136
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,129
micro encapsulated powder that we talked

137
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,230
about earlier is one of our newer

138
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,969
innovations to make sure that happens so

139
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,220
you can just take some of the mornings

140
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,320
from the afternoon some right before you

141
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,940
go to bed and take a little single

142
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,050
service serving size that kind of mix

143
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,699
into whatever you want to put it in

144
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,129
exactly so we have different flavors

145
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,409
throughout the day you know berry citrus

146
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,079
cocoa things like that but the idea is

147
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,300
that you're it's something that somebody

148
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,339
can add to their protein shake or their

149
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,040
oatmeal or their tea or their coffee on

150
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,418
a regular basis and just make it just

151
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,890
like all the other biohacking things

152
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:18,579
that people are doing to find better

153
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,870
ways to live and use natural plants to

154
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:23,859
give their body the information to heal

155
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,840
themselves I think for us we need to

156
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,080
distinguish two markets one is to

157
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,149
business to business market which is the

158
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,449
prevailing market for us internationally

159
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:36,788
there we as the largest producer in

160
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,479
Europe we clearly go for bulk products

161
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:41,300
we go for privately

162
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,360
and white labeling on on the whole

163
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,420
spectrum starting from flour cessation

164
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,139
products below 20% THC so it's really

165
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,090
nice flowers but they're federally legal

166
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:56,149
similar to the farm bill that has passed

167
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:58,819
here in the states all the way to seep

168
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:01,339
the oils and isolates terpene fractions

169
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,219
etc etc in Switzerland we're also

170
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,789
selling more dietary supplements to farm

171
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,980
seeds

172
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,350
we're having a few thousand points of

173
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,200
sales I know this sounds like nothing to

174
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,879
you guys here back home for a email

175
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,560
people market is it's quite a bit and

176
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,659
there it's also business to customer and

177
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,269
more so these tobacco cessation products

178
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,930
with up to one percent THC because in

179
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:29,599
Switzerland the law is not like these in

180
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,120
states with 0.3 percent THC but 1

181
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,460
percent meaning Switzerland's turning

182
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,259
into this hub of CBD production there's

183
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:38,750
different varieties we can grow it's not

184
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:43,879
hemp it's really this cannabis type with

185
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:47,660
a low THC and we we have the whole width

186
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,639
of products started with 50 sealed kind

187
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,680
of felt the market testing the waters

188
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,050
seeing that some are really worth it

189
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,189
others we've we've dispatched talked a

190
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,250
little bit about some of the ones you've

191
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:01,089
tossed aside some of the products that

192
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,649
you've decided not to pursue absolutely

193
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:06,619
we will resume those but for instance

194
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:09,079
the CBD infuse beer since it's a

195
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,840
considered a noble food we stopped and

196
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,609
we gotta wait for laws to change to to

197
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,549
bring us back onto the market we've had

198
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,470
some were selling candies these days but

199
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,110
for instance some CBD pace we stopped

200
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,360
doing so and we just had to focus on a

201
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,030
few things because we were organically

202
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,710
financed and we just can't do can't do

203
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:32,329
everything David maybe I'm going to

204
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,309
circle back to you and and have you

205
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,550
talked a little bit about how people who

206
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:40,098
are coming into the CBD space I know

207
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,439
that the USPTO Patent and Trademark

208
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,259
Office has said pushback against

209
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,360
cannabis in the past what what does the

210
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,559
farm bill mean for cannabis in the

211
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,389
future when it comes to patents and

212
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,778
trademarks great question

213
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:57,199
we don't know for sure yet exactly what

214
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:02,759
the farm bill is going to mean because

215
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,980
the law in general moves slowly and the

216
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:09,328
Patent and Trademark Office moves slowly

217
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:12,089
so for example on a good day if we filed

218
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:14,509
a u.s. trademark application today and

219
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,880
I'm talking for just this moment about

220
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:19,889
trademarks as opposed to patents so it's

221
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,429
the Patent and Trademark Office one

222
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:25,319
office but you can think of it as

223
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,208
there's the patent door over here and

224
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,589
the trademark door over there and

225
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,139
they're not the same and they don't

226
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:33,630
treat cannabis or cannabis related

227
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,088
products the same way but if we filed a

228
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:41,250
trademark application today for a brand

229
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:42,300
name you know Dave's Naturals okay I

230
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,458
want to file a trademark application

231
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,919
today for Dave's Naturals for any

232
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,169
product whether it's cannabis or not if

233
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,599
I file it today it's gonna sit in a

234
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:54,929
queue an electronic queue for a minimum

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,540
of four months before a trademark lawyer

236
00:09:54,929 --> 00:10:00,059
at the trademark office even looks at it

237
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,559
so farm bill was signed December 20th of

238
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:06,989
last year if somebody filed a trademark

239
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:08,578
application for shampoo containing CBD

240
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,019
that's compliant with the farm bill

241
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:12,629
let's say if that's how they described

242
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,209
it whatever that for Dave Naturals for

243
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,519
shampoo containing CBD that's compliant

244
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:19,349
with the farm bill they filed it that

245
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,789
day or the next day that application

246
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,470
isn't going to be looked at until

247
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:28,230
ironically 4:20 at the FDA least and

248
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,870
probably longer because of the

249
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,690
government shutdown and so we don't know

250
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,509
yet we don't know capital and capital K

251
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:39,149
capital n capital o w we don't know what

252
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:41,909
exactly they're gonna do we think I

253
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:47,970
think my office thinks others of my kind

254
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:49,500
think that they may allow trademark

255
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,990
applications for the first time they've

256
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,659
been prohibiting they've been excluding

257
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:59,399
trademark applications for anything that

258
00:10:54,659 --> 00:11:01,860
is cannabis contains cannabis or touches

259
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,958
cannabis such as a testing facility or

260
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,139
trimming equipment for the better part

261
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,789
of

262
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:11,840
the last five or six years they've been

263
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:14,429
very very prohibitive we think that now

264
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,410
certain types of products that contain

265
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:19,139
CBD that complies with the hemp bill

266
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:23,399
hemp deriving the farm bill hemp derived

267
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:26,490
CBD with less than 0.3 percent THC not

268
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,360
ingestible I'm thinking so not tinctures

269
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,450
not edibles

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,259
but topicals shampoos conditioners

271
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:36,000
patches where no health claims are made

272
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:39,179
that's going to be pretty pretty

273
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,830
important may get through so you're all

274
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,209
in and you're all if you're in this

275
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,910
business or thinking about getting in

276
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:48,139
this business or this industry or this

277
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:51,149
this movement you're risk takers so

278
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:53,250
we're thinking it's time to take some

279
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,100
risks and try these trademark

280
00:11:53,250 --> 00:12:00,750
applications don't wait we why wait for

281
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,620
four or five six months and the reason

282
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:09,600
we're not more sure is because although

283
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:12,299
the farm bill seems to decriminalize CBD

284
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,310
the FDA the same day the Food and Drug

285
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,500
Administration the same day that the

286
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:19,649
farm bill was signed the FDA issued the

287
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,389
Chairman chairperson of the FDA issued a

288
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,929
statement that essentially said not so

289
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:26,279
fast you're not sure I think there's an

290
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:30,599
important distinction to make there

291
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,639
between laws and regulations that we

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,420
passed the law now regulators are

293
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,679
stepping in to try to sort of steer the

294
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,229
ship when it comes to how that law is

295
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,559
interpreted and how its executed on on a

296
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,149
product level I think one of the big

297
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,949
lessons that we've learned from the FDA

298
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:47,909
and and the announcement you're talking

299
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,680
about is that you have to be very

300
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,899
careful about making health claims yeah

301
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,849
because there are not the studies to

302
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:56,100
back it up FDA is its own approval

303
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,889
process for that and that process takes

304
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,840
time it's it's not gonna happen

305
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:03,600
overnight so I think people who are

306
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,250
thinking about running a CBD business

307
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,279
here stateside there's gonna be a little

308
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:11,340
bit of an uncertainty from the federal

309
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,720
level and ultimately you they want you

310
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,899
to be really careful about making health

311
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,820
claims you guys have anything

312
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,799
on that well I think it's very important

313
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,879
what you just said that that federally

314
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:26,789
it's legal and the FDA what they did was

315
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:30,169
mention that now as a dietary supplement

316
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:33,750
there's a pathway for CBD to become

317
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:35,189
regulatory ly approved right and so

318
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,559
they're working with us they're working

319
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,210
with the hemp roundtable they're working

320
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,159
with lots of different organizations to

321
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,080
make sure that they figure all of this

322
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,449
out because it's not that they don't

323
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,389
want to do it it's that all the

324
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,190
different stores and people that report

325
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,019
to them or ask them and they work with

326
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,970
on a daily basis or saying what do we do

327
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,919
and so now they're trying to figure it

328
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,778
out so we're all trying to work together

329
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,299
to help them be able to figure it out

330
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:02,909
and each individual state with that

331
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:05,639
information from the FDA is now making

332
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:08,490
their own different regulations but it's

333
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,470
this isn't DEA this is an ATF this isn't

334
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,730
it you know they're not coming for you

335
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,200
and they don't care about anecdotal

336
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,940
evidence that that's not that's not

337
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,160
what's going on but I think another very

338
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,450
important thing you need to that you

339
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,350
made a distinction on is making claims

340
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:26,009
and making claims is something that

341
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,959
isn't just a CVD thing right I mean the

342
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:31,470
FDA jumps on all sorts of industries

343
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:33,389
that we all see on late-night TV for for

344
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,040
making all sorts of claims and I think

345
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,049
it's very easy for people in our

346
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,329
industry because CVD is such a powerful

347
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,740
thing to go to that low-hanging fruit

348
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,040
and start making those claims and we

349
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,539
really need to police ourselves now to

350
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,278
make sure that we're all saying the

351
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:50,599
right things and we're all being ethical

352
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:55,470
and moral not just following FDA and

353
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,629
legal guidelines I know that Nick I know

354
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,899
that Nick had some of the stuff in his

355
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:03,389
presentation prior to this about the

356
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,829
whu-oh and Europe maybe Jana could just

357
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:09,569
talk a little bit about how the the regs

358
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:11,550
are different Europe it is a different

359
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:15,720
approach European Union and Switzerland

360
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:18,120
take as long as the varieties meat is

361
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,060
0.2 percent THC level in the European

362
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,580
Union or this 1 percent in Switzerland

363
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,919
the plants are regulated in the sense

364
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,190
that it's perfectly legal like any other

365
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,939
crop like maize like soy you can grow it

366
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,030
you can sell it

367
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,790
and what claims is concerned the only

368
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:39,569
limitation is that we are not allowed to

369
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:41,579
put claims on CD products but there's

370
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,370
ways around it we have registered

371
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,190
dietary supplements you just need to

372
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,340
find those unfortunately the loopholes

373
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,700
we're working with the authorities with

374
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,410
the regular regulators we founded a

375
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,710
syndicate on cannabis in the European

376
00:15:55,409 --> 00:16:00,419
Union to bring forward and to bring

377
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,610
progress but currently it's

378
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,079
unfortunately kind of funding there the

379
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,230
ways through and the loopholes and

380
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,500
that's how we can do claims but we

381
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:12,840
currently refrain from doing so because

382
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,879
the laws changed quickly and as it is

383
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,550
here with the states it's with the

384
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,529
countries in Europe it can be that one

385
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:22,259
day you can sell and the other day it's

386
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:24,419
over yeah and so here in California I

387
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,610
think many of you may know that the

388
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,409
dispensary system and the manufacturing

389
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,560
systems here do not allow any hemp

390
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:33,360
derived CBD products so essentially in

391
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,099
our state regulators here on the hem

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,750
side are pretty far behind in terms of

393
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,930
building the brock bureaucracy and regs

394
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,580
and issuing permits and and so many many

395
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:45,029
hemp companies here stateside are going

396
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,400
to different different states Oregon

397
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:49,079
Kentucky North Carolina where they're

398
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,029
really embracing this business and

399
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,629
trying to fast-track it I think we've

400
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:56,549
also seen if you look at Oregon

401
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:58,529
cultivation as it as it sort of

402
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,729
commoditize is a little bit more a lot

403
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,100
of the farmers in Oregon have been

404
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,289
pivoting really hard to CBD because they

405
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,900
can move from a small canopy to hundreds

406
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:09,329
of acres and it's been a it's been a

407
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,710
boon for them and I think that's gonna

408
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,480
be their opportunity I know they were

409
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,579
lobbying to try to export cannabis a to

410
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,200
Oregon I kind of think that that's a

411
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,689
slim chance of happening but they can

412
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,480
produce CBD flour and hemp there and and

413
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:24,150
export it it's not still stopping

414
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,740
certain to incidences where truck gets

415
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,130
pulled over with CBD flour and somebody

416
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,569
gets arrested or because they a local

417
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,580
cop isn't gonna trust your paperwork

418
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:35,099
it's looks smells and quacks like a duck

419
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:37,949
it's duct to them so I

420
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,659
Oklahoma right yeah exactly so that kind

421
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,900
of stuff does happen and and I think

422
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,470
there's a lot of really smart people in

423
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,909
the dispensed

424
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,440
your business here in California and

425
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:48,090
they know what works and they're making

426
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,288
sure their clients get it whether it

427
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:50,939
comes from hemp or whether it comes from

428
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:52,769
marijuana and knowing the difference

429
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,519
between the actual legal definition of

430
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:58,200
what hemp is and the actual botanical or

431
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,720
biological definition of what hemp is

432
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,319
and providing what is beneficial to

433
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,048
their clients it's unfortunate that it

434
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,558
seems that a regulatory system is trying

435
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:13,769
to regulate something they don't

436
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:16,200
understand and so I think it's up to us

437
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:17,460
here in this room and and throughout the

438
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,319
state of California to continue to do

439
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,579
that we're providing our hem cvd

440
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,950
products throughout California it's one

441
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,149
of our largest states and while it's

442
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,529
unfortunate that most of the

443
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,538
dispensaries can't carry our products

444
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:29,220
currently today we're working closely

445
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,690
with the state of California to make

446
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,769
sure that it does but you can get it at

447
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,080
the grocery store you can get it from

448
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:35,940
your doctor you can get it from the

449
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:38,579
acupuncturist the coffee shop down the

450
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,460
street so it makes only sense that

451
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:42,750
people going for what they for what they

452
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,679
need should be able to get at the

453
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,929
dispensary - it makes no sense could you

454
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,669
guys maybe talk a little bit about the

455
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,950
different delivery systems I know that

456
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:54,750
Kris you guys have sort of a unique play

457
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,220
in this can you guys talk about some of

458
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,798
the other ways that people are consuming

459
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,500
this and and where the opportunities are

460
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,319
in that currently given especially given

461
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,288
sort of the FDA is sort of talking more

462
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,210
and more about food products and stuff

463
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:11,038
of that nature

464
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:13,169
sure well Yannick has a lot of different

465
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,720
delivery systems that he's talked about

466
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:17,520
his pre-rolls and he's very innovative

467
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,620
over in Sweden and throughout Europe

468
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:26,038
we're very sorry Switzerland overs my

469
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:27,359
completely my mistake additionally we're

470
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,190
working on a lot of different delivery

471
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,319
systems I mentioned a few times our

472
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,080
micro encapsulation process very proud

473
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,029
of our liposomal CBD but probably our

474
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,119
flagship product is our expand its the

475
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:41,548
most raw form of the CBD oil that we

476
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,219
provide in an airless delivery oral

477
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:45,418
applicator that people just love and so

478
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,860
they're taking it the most natural

479
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:51,659
version of the CBD product but we know

480
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:54,538
that not everybody wants to take their

481
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:56,669
CBD in the same way so we're trying to

482
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:57,989
find different ways to fit because

483
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,820
one of the hardest questions I'm asked

484
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,350
as a sales and marketing guy is what's

485
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,178
your demographic you know who's your

486
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:05,209
ideal client well with CVD it's like

487
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,859
everybody from eight to eighty right and

488
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,929
and trying to narrow that down we're

489
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:12,028
doing that by product sets finding a

490
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:14,309
delivery system that helps you know and

491
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:16,138
fits that demographic and that need and

492
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:18,028
filling the needs to make sure that

493
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:19,798
somebody doesn't have to look at a big

494
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:22,739
giant scary white syringe and say how

495
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,868
much do I take and you know the size of

496
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:26,940
a grain of rice like what and that

497
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:28,259
doesn't make any sense and so trying to

498
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,580
figure that stuff out for people and

499
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,440
help them get really good

500
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,288
well-thought-out delivery systems and

501
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,970
products you got anything to add there

502
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:39,538
in terms of your delivery systems and

503
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,639
sort of what'swhat's working yes the

504
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:44,220
delivery systems are closely linked to

505
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:47,969
claims because back home were not

506
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,710
allowed to do claims on CVD and but

507
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,350
we've experienced from patients

508
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,440
reporting that the SE candies or

509
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:57,538
sublingual drops work much better far

510
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,580
better than things they ingest also

511
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:01,919
what's very important to us is to go

512
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:04,230
with full-spectrum extracts because from

513
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,669
experience and from reports these are

514
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:11,730
far superior in terms of the efficiency

515
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:13,649
than the isolates that's that's kind of

516
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,079
our experience we're working together

517
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,969
with patients and hospitals more so

518
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,329
outside of the European Union because

519
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,608
within it's quite difficult we'll be

520
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:26,878
bringing new products soon to the

521
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:30,928
markets not to the state tip but anyways

522
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:32,849
you can ship worldwide so maybe but it's

523
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:37,379
more the claims that are limiting it

524
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:38,878
than the delivery systems cool I want to

525
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:41,069
skip back to you David here for a minute

526
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:43,949
I want to talk a little bit about the

527
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:46,888
difference between a USPTO LA and

528
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:50,249
California law when it comes to doing

529
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:52,048
business as sure so the difference

530
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:55,350
between California law and federal law

531
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:57,239
it again keeps us keeps us awake at

532
00:21:55,349 --> 00:22:01,439
night trying to figure out things

533
00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:03,980
different keep everything separate or

534
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,929
understand the differences so we've got

535
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,839
the federal system which for many years

536
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:09,580
the

537
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,490
that on the trademark side again on the

538
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:15,339
on the trademark side has been very

539
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,549
restrictive when it comes to trademarks

540
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:19,959
for cannabis products or anything that

541
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,099
contains cannabis or anything that

542
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,380
touches cannabis and I draw that

543
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:28,419
distinction again because people say to

544
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:30,250
me often well can I get a can I get a

545
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,200
trademark registration I can't get it

546
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,299
can I get a trademark registration for

547
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,299
my clothing product if it has a pot leaf

548
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:41,049
on it and the answer is yes it's not the

549
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:42,669
pot leaf on the product that triggers

550
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,889
the refusal from the Patent and

551
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,019
Trademark Office it's the product itself

552
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,420
if the product is cannabis such as

553
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,400
cannabis or contains cannabis no you can

554
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,320
call it you know again

555
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,750
Dave's Naturals not have a pot leaf on

556
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,639
it but if it contains cannabis or is

557
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,920
cannabis it's gonna get rejected or you

558
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,840
can have a product that has a giant pot

559
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,769
leaf all over it if it's not doesn't

560
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,539
violate the CSA it's gonna sail through

561
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,670
so the trademark office has had this

562
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:12,399
prohibition for years they in fact have

563
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:15,820
five or six lawyers who I informally

564
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,920
referred to as the pot Posse who are

565
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:20,200
specifically assigned to looking at all

566
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,210
trademark applications federal trademark

567
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,650
applications that appear to have

568
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,819
anything to do with cannabis and they're

569
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,830
very smart and they're very

570
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:29,859
knowledgeable and they're carrying out

571
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:32,379
their job as they are told to do their

572
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:34,089
job and the irony is the reason you can

573
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,030
walk through the Patent Office door and

574
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:38,769
get a patent for cannabis or a cannabis

575
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,660
product but you can't get a trademark

576
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:42,549
for a product that contains cannabis is

577
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,850
because the trademark law specifically

578
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:48,369
says words to the effect of thou shalt

579
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:50,859
not issue a trademark registration for

580
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:55,569
anything that is illegal so that puts

581
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:59,079
cannabis under that the CSA and nuclear

582
00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:01,389
weapons in the same category where there

583
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,769
is no such sentence in the patent laws

584
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,600
so that's why you can walk through the

585
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:06,849
patent door and get a pen now we go to

586
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,129
California which for years and years and

587
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:12,309
years and years followed the federal law

588
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,480
no trademark applications for cannabis

589
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:17,409
products or anything that touched

590
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:20,110
cannabis until January 1 of 2018 a year

591
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,730
ago and the law changed in California

592
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:23,919
and the California trademark unit

593
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,980
Sacramento now accepts trademark

594
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,350
applications for products for cannabis

595
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:34,210
products or that products that container

596
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:37,209
touch cannabis so long as they are

597
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:39,850
compliant with California law so you

598
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:43,210
have to be able yeah basically they

599
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:45,399
don't ask for your BCC license in other

600
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,730
words the state trademark unit does not

601
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,980
ask to see your BCC license when you

602
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,079
file a trademark application they ask

603
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,700
you to sign your application under your

604
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:56,589
trademark application or in a penalty of

605
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,080
perjury they'll take your word for it

606
00:24:56,589 --> 00:25:00,909
and they'll leave it to litigation later

607
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,069
on down the road with a competitor if

608
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,509
you sue a competitor and it turns out

609
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:07,149
you falsified your trademark application

610
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:09,339
to get your trademark registration the

611
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,900
kind of trademark unit in Sacramento

612
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:12,879
will leave it to the courts to decide

613
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,400
whether you fraudulently got your

614
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,010
trademark registration but you can get a

615
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,560
trademark registration in California I

616
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:22,720
would say make sure you have your BCC

617
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,220
license in your file so you can show

618
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,809
that if you ever have to down the road

619
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:31,210
so there's a lot of companies in the

620
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:33,220
cannabis space with the same name that

621
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,900
that's a common occurrence you see it

622
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,360
pretty frequently that some of the names

623
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,450
or we have seven clients and on my

624
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,159
little firm that have Humboldt in their

625
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,080
name and we've had to put pictures of

626
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,150
the names and the pictures of the

627
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,069
operators like on the and the post

628
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,640
office yep to keep them separate

629
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:54,689
everybody and their brother wants to use

630
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,490
Humboldt emerald-green

631
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,190
can or canna

632
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,980
and it creates confusion in the

633
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,720
marketplace you might recommend people

634
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,880
go a different way I think I recommend

635
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,410
people go a different way yes I do the

636
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,690
more clever and creative you can be the

637
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,700
better off you are so the classic

638
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,890
example that I like to use to help

639
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,740
people understand this is Apple is a

640
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:23,980
dictionary word word you can find in the

641
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:27,430
dictionary that makes it seemingly

642
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:30,039
generic but when applied to computers

643
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:33,940
and small electronic devices its unique

644
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,009
because apples are not computers and

645
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,259
small electronics of

646
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:39,269
in the real world so Apple is a

647
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:42,509
trademark for computers and small

648
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:44,250
electronics is a 10 on a scale of 0 to

649
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:48,059
10 zero being the worst ten being the

650
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:51,029
best however Apple as a trademark for

651
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:53,879
applesauce or apple juice would be a

652
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:57,029
zero because in that context it would be

653
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,680
generic say you want to be as clever and

654
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:02,549
unique as you possibly can

655
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:05,400
mrs. Fields Exxon Kodak Xerox Famous

656
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:07,589
Amos those prot those trademarks those

657
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,240
brand names help you identify and

658
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:11,159
distinguish your product from the

659
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,319
competitors product and they stand apart

660
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,750
on the shelf and in the magazines and

661
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,549
all your advertising and they're easy to

662
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,589
remember and they say nothing about the

663
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:21,210
product yeah and then occasionally you

664
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:24,869
might get lucky and end up being a

665
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,610
Kleenex where a Kleenex where you wear

666
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:28,199
your brand name becomes the thing that

667
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:31,979
it actually although they have to spend

668
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,100
millions of dollars a year advertising

669
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,860
that Kleenex is a noun not a verb yeah

670
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:39,559
they don't want you they don't want

671
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:42,289
people going to the store and saying

672
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,309
where's the where's the Kleenex aisle

673
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:46,470
they want you to go into the store and

674
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:50,579
say where where can I find the Kleenex

675
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:53,910
brand tissue paper exactly cool cool I

676
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:56,579
guess I want to switch back to you Chris

677
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,860
I want to hear a little bit about the

678
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:02,309
challenges of sort of taking a CBD

679
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:03,839
company global from from sort of I think

680
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:05,639
you know I think yeah everyone needs to

681
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,799
start somewhere but finding global

682
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,870
opportunities obviously is a is a

683
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,460
challenge could you sort of talk about

684
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,199
your guyses journey a little bit from

685
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,170
from where you guys started and have

686
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,600
where he ended up going global sure so

687
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,550
Alexson all was founded by Paul bending

688
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:23,039
him who has been in the hemp industry

689
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,740
over two decades he brought the very

690
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,649
first hemp bar to the UK the 9:00 bar

691
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,120
and he's been innovating in the imp

692
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,700
industry and growing in the industry

693
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,319
ever since so he did a lot of the heavy

694
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,250
lifting for a lot of people in the

695
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,539
industry including us and so when he

696
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:42,329
decided to found

697
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:45,329
Alexson all because so many people

698
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:47,329
wanted CBD five years ago and there was

699
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:48,889
no way to get it so

700
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:52,129
what we started doing initially was

701
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:55,490
importing CBD I'm working or from Europe

702
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,720
we had farms yep so we had to import CBD

703
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,680
from Europe initially because they

704
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,539
wouldn't let us grow it here in the

705
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,519
United States and when they finally let

706
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,990
us grow it here in the United States we

707
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,279
quickly moved to be able to do that so

708
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,630
we have farms in Colorado growing it and

709
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,210
it's difficult I mean you mentioned

710
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,740
earlier esct acre I was very very

711
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,990
privileged to be able to work with Paul

712
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,420
and Gabe who have been risk takers

713
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,370
because they saw what good CBD could do

714
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:22,279
in the world and they saw the impact

715
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:24,829
that hemp can make in the world so by

716
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:27,980
taking those risks and being innovative

717
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:30,259
and understanding that good will went

718
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,120
out they they were invested a lot of

719
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:35,390
time and took a lot of risks and there's

720
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:38,959
been times that you know it didn't look

721
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:42,740
good for the CBD world and when we went

722
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,360
public a year ago January going through

723
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,450
the legal process and not just

724
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:49,000
backfilling and you know reverse merging

725
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,350
into an existing company but actually

726
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,390
going public on the Australian Stock

727
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:56,269
Exchange explaining to lawyers and

728
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:59,900
explaining to finance people the risks

729
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:03,430
that we took importing CBD and creating

730
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:06,140
our CBD and all those type of things are

731
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,460
are challenging you know and they they

732
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,550
gave me a lot of the gray hair I have

733
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:12,470
today and definitely have been worth it

734
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,899
though every second of it and every

735
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:18,110
minute of it's been worth it and we all

736
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,759
work really hard and and are a testament

737
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:21,559
to though the work that the people that

738
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,039
came before me I mean the very first

739
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:27,349
cannabis trade show I came to was ICBC a

740
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,450
little over five years ago great and so

741
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:31,819
it's it's been it's been amazing awesome

742
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,860
I guess this questions for maybe both

743
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:34,519
you and Yannick how do you guys compete

744
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,669
with the big dogs

745
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,139
if this thing becomes federal legal and

746
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,420
well it is but when when the when the

747
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,980
regs shake out and we start getting the

748
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,750
General Mills into the business or some

749
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,220
of these other major companies coming in

750
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,630
like how do you guys how do you guys

751
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,269
compete with them how do you compete

752
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,820
with wholesale extracts and isolates

753
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:55,519
coming out of China you guys just talk a

754
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:59,500
little bit about that it doesn't feel so

755
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,500
much like competition to be honest too

756
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:08,519
say we started small and which is two

757
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,039
years old and then we kind of start

758
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:14,910
producing people started demanding we

759
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,950
started growing and there's few things

760
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,570
to our success one was the vertical

761
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,850
integration I know there was this debate

762
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:22,859
before whether it's smart and not to be

763
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:24,629
vertically integrated for us we have

764
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:27,269
this family cultural constant exchange

765
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,920
between the various companies and this

766
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:31,279
was one thing that's helped us at the

767
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,350
same time we've been diversifying and

768
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,720
specializing which is near impossible

769
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:40,439
this was thanks to the growth and lastly

770
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:45,089
we have the strategic alliances to other

771
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:48,269
continents to universities law firms etc

772
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:51,869
etc and this kind of helped us sustain

773
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:57,150
in the market and there's such a large

774
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:59,039
demand there space for many more cool I

775
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,660
think we're gonna take we only got about

776
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,750
five minutes left so we're gonna open it

777
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,220
up for some QA if anybody wants to try

778
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,470
to get any girls attention I'm right

779
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,230
here man alright let's hear it again for

780
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:13,319
Mitchell the whole panel on CBD which is

781
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:16,710
everywhere it's like I'm the presence I

782
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,849
got a quick what do you do when I guess

783
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:21,120
it doesn't matter to you but when they

784
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:22,469
ban CBD in like New York where you can't

785
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,869
put it in food and stuff anymore have

786
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:28,650
you seen a dip in anything or so the

787
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:30,599
city was it's banned which is a pretty

788
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,450
cool sensational headline on a news

789
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:36,359
article but what CBD what they're

790
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:38,370
looking to do is follow regulations that

791
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,979
they think are coming from the FDA and

792
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:44,639
not allowing people to put it into a

793
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,200
commercial food or like a cocktail so

794
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,759
that's the regulation that they just

795
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,410
brought in but you can still buy all of

796
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,339
our products throughout you know in New

797
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,900
York and we're still shipping in New

798
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,879
York so they're just working through

799
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,200
those regulations and we work really

800
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,330
close with the state of New York to help

801
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,279
them start to figure out these things

802
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:02,309
and it's just a knee-jerk because

803
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,629
everybody wants to it because the other

804
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:05,909
side of it because you really have to

805
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:09,810
have a 360 view New York is also the one

806
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,670
handing out the licenses to grow hemp

807
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:12,419
everywhere they're handing out licenses

808
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,279
to

809
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,558
extract him you know they're really

810
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,910
investing in the EM community so they're

811
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,410
they're just not talking to each other

812
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,670
yet and once they do it'll all get

813
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,650
worked out it sounds like they're

814
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:27,058
fumbling through interpretation of

815
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:29,820
federal law right do you think that the

816
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:31,678
FDA should be the entity to regulate CBD

817
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:35,879
or should it be left to States or just

818
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,200
hippies or so FDA the FDA is a great

819
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,299
organization for us to be able to work

820
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,130
with I think they're looking for to

821
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:42,808
education to figure it out and I think

822
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,640
the individual organizations in each

823
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:46,710
state absolutely should be able to

824
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,140
figure it out their own - and we're

825
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,730
working with each one to help them we

826
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,650
have a you know a giant spreadsheet on

827
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,910
each state and we're always working with

828
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,798
them with our different lobbyists and

829
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,630
different organizations - to make sure

830
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:59,039
that they know what's going on yeah I

831
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,570
think everyone in this room here can

832
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,639
help also by engaging their lawmakers

833
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:03,509
and regulators if you ever have an

834
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,799
opportunity to have those conversations

835
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:11,280
um I think there's also a deeper need in

836
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:13,739
this business for data studies and I

837
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,629
think the more that we can convince our

838
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,279
institutions and science organizations

839
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:19,858
and health organizations to study this

840
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,240
and lobby groups and lobbyists crews the

841
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:24,509
better off the better off we're all be

842
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:27,079
in the end and rally your mother your

843
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:30,690
father your grandmother your grandfather

844
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:33,418
your aunt and uncle because so that your

845
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:36,148
legislators see that it's not just a

846
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:39,329
certain demographic that is pushing this

847
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:41,309
but that there are like real adults in

848
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:43,559
the room health benefits up and down the

849
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:45,299
entire spectrum of the show and how many

850
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:46,980
have a mother father grandmother or

851
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,869
grandfather who in the last year have

852
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,710
said something like oh my girlfriends

853
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:55,470
and I just love that CBD stuff yeah

854
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:58,108
it's phenomenal seek the dialogue with

855
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:59,429
everyone yeah I guess I guess the point

856
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:03,000
there is we all know somebody who's

857
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:05,699
benefited from it but that's not enough

858
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,880
for the FDA we need people to study this

859
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:10,469
we needed to be done the right way you

860
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,930
know and and when we get there I think

861
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:15,480
the whole thing will grow better with a

862
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:18,809
lot less pain so I have a quick question

863
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,730
so um I am working with jetty extracts

864
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:23,789
who's traditionally been the THC space

865
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,719
we're looking to now we're looking to

866
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,818
create jetty CBD so

867
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,559
my job has been like procuring where to

868
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:31,059
find distillate we're having trouble

869
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,549
finding folks that are able to actually

870
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:37,029
produce whole plan full-spectrum

871
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:39,339
extracted distillate better that that

872
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:42,099
protocol after extraction has less than

873
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:43,989
0.3 percent THC you know not the dry way

874
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,640
but the after so you know like someone

875
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:48,818
like us who's looking to do like 20 you

876
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:50,409
know kilos a month on going you know not

877
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:51,519
only is that a sourcing issue but also

878
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:54,549
I'm wondering what you guys are seeing

879
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,440
in markets like core power yoga or you

880
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,589
know different you know health food

881
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,940
stores cafes if we're trying to go into

882
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:02,920
the vapor out which hasn't been

883
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,119
traditionally as popular as like the

884
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,650
tinctures or topicals

885
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,079
what are you guys seeing as far as the

886
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,000
interest in that why has it more why

887
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,130
haven't worn that because I'm coming I

888
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,539
feel like am I missing something I feel

889
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,970
like we're kind of first to market to do

890
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:17,739
this but I'd love some kind of context

891
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:21,489
from y'all I'm not an expert in this but

892
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:26,318
part of what I think is nicotine I think

893
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:28,929
that has a big big effect on vaping in

894
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:31,900
general I think the FDA's made that very

895
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:33,759
clear to that they see nicotine vaping

896
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,680
is a big problem especially in with

897
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,200
youth usage and some of these other

898
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,259
things that the nicotine in vape pens is

899
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:45,219
powerful and additionally you know

900
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:46,800
vaping is an exercise one hand you've

901
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:51,250
got THC the other hand you've got

902
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,539
nicotine CBD it's a different delivery

903
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,338
method that I think these guys could

904
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:55,539
also talk about in terms of all the

905
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,489
different delivery methods that are

906
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:58,630
coming on there's space for it but maybe

907
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,068
you guys could add I think I think

908
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,720
you're exactly right on I think it's an

909
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:05,380
amazing market I think you should be

910
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:08,500
going full force into it and I think

911
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:11,200
that the the risk that we talked about

912
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,838
earlier is nicotine but that people are

913
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:17,199
associated with nicotine but mainly that

914
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:20,259
big hesitation has been ATF that you

915
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,480
that product set has to be regulated by

916
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,980
that three-letter organization and the

917
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,079
CBD industry already has so many other

918
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,818
three-letter organizations coming after

919
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,160
them that they've been hesitant to pick

920
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:31,719
one more but I think it's an amazing way

921
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,190
to get CBD into your body and I think

922
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,419
you should talk to me after and we'll

923
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,780
make sure that we get jeti because I

924
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,090
love jetties sushi

925
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,220
so let's let's make sure we get daddy

926
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:45,050
some good CBD fantastic time for two

927
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:47,599
more hi my name is Sean Blackwell and I

928
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:49,250
am actually from Idaho and I have a I

929
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,759
have a Facebook page

930
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:54,699
that's called legalize hemp in Idaho

931
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,170
it's actually still illegal in Idaho and

932
00:37:54,699 --> 00:38:01,039
we we had a bust

933
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,480
in southern Idaho recently they got my

934
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,590
face on the news cuz people started

935
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,650
asking me questions

936
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:08,570
what is marijuana as opposed to hemp

937
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,720
because Idaho obviously is not

938
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:14,000
interested in marijuana at all and

939
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:17,029
making it a really great place for hemp

940
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,059
to be grown because there won't be any

941
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,230
cross pollenization so a lot of people

942
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:22,789
don't really think about that because

943
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:27,260
that's gonna be a huge issue camp coming

944
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:29,360
up I want you to like elaborate on like

945
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,630
the legalization in states like Idaho

946
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,030
and also like the fact that it will be

947
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:38,840
beneficial for a state like that because

948
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:41,600
of the lack of cross pollenization so

949
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,829
you're talking about a growing hemp in I

950
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,349
know so what you're talking about

951
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:48,409
which is it is still definitely illegal

952
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:49,880
in Idaho right growing it right we were

953
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,909
talking about that busted green room

954
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,670
right so grow growing it and obviously

955
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:58,699
that's a big source of income social

956
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:00,860
revenue source of of ways for to revive

957
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:02,269
our economy here in the United States so

958
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,349
I'm really happy that all these

959
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:04,009
different states are starting to

960
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:06,079
legalize it

961
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:09,500
I would love Idaho to grow it because

962
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,619
finding areas like Idaho that have land

963
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,630
that you could easily certify organic to

964
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,250
grow is hard to find because there's

965
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,400
lots of states that are legalizing it

966
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,019
that don't have hardly any land that you

967
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,630
could certify organic because they've

968
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:25,400
been growing tobacco or cotton or or all

969
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,470
sorts of things on it that have GMOs and

970
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,849
pesticides and things in it so I'd love

971
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:32,059
Idaho to do it and we're absolutely

972
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:33,619
working with the hemp around table we're

973
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:35,630
working with the hemp Industrial

974
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:37,190
Association we're working with all sorts

975
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,809
of organizations to help move those laws

976
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:41,420
along so I think it's only a matter of

977
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,380
time before it happens so thank you for

978
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,119
doing the work that you're doing there

979
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,170
and and just hang in there it's gonna

980
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,098
it's going to happen soon

981
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,170
let me ask two

982
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:53,880
guy I'm over here sitting down my feet

983
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:55,499
hurt hi so I to his point about cross

984
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,778
pollenization like I'm all for Idaho

985
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:59,608
growing him because you know we grow a

986
00:39:57,778 --> 00:40:01,949
pretty good weed out here in California

987
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:06,268
we don't want your boys and our girls as

988
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:06,929
I laugh that was a good job you

989
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:08,939
understand what I'm talking about

990
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:10,679
because him pollen can fly up to 30

991
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,960
miles sometimes and if you got a

992
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:14,728
recreational grow five miles from a hemp

993
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,298
grow all of a sudden you've got problems

994
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:20,248
and so please PLEASE legalize hemp in

995
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:28,338
Idaho and Nebraska so they can grow it

996
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:31,288
and we can just grow good we high panel

997
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:33,058
my question is sort of bringing it back

998
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:35,670
to basics a little bit I think that a

999
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:37,559
lot of people don't really know what CBD

1000
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,108
is versus cannabis and the general

1001
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:42,749
market outside this room and I'm

1002
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:45,058
wondering if there is any effort to

1003
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:47,969
educate people out there in the public

1004
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:50,339
as to the benefits of CBD not on a brand

1005
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:53,218
level but on a basic level so that

1006
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:54,659
people can go out there and look to

1007
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:58,019
buying it and actually know what they're

1008
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:59,969
buying it for maybe to give you some

1009
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:02,488
insight how we've done it back home is

1010
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:04,588
we started with the cannabis farm and

1011
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:08,699
we've grown cannabis publicly meaning

1012
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:10,619
cannabis a low THC and people could just

1013
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:13,889
walk in there were information banners

1014
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:16,289
we've been giving tours to police to to

1015
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:18,058
the government etc etc it's a it's

1016
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:20,960
absolutely amazing I was there a few

1017
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:23,160
weeks ago it's Alex

1018
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,719
this is how we've got this media

1019
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:29,848
coverage to to represent CBD make people

1020
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:32,969
realize what its benefits are how they

1021
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:36,119
can use it might be an approach you can

1022
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:37,739
go for afterwards the other speakers one

1023
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,479
is from Switzerland Ben from Canada

1024
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:41,219
trade that will give you more insights

1025
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:43,710
on the whole regulations and Swiss

1026
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:48,239
market European market so you might want

1027
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:50,068
to stay put with him so absolutely we're

1028
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,400
alright we're working on education on

1029
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:54,538
our end as well we're working with

1030
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,639
lobbyists we're working with hospitals

1031
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:58,380
we're working with colleges working with

1032
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,579
States to make sure that everybody

1033
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,269
understands that CBD

1034
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:05,289
is an amazing product and that hemp is

1035
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:08,019
the difference between the biological

1036
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:10,509
definition from hemp and the legal

1037
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:12,759
definition of him because you know I

1038
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:15,130
think earlier you said the difference

1039
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,940
between CBD and cannabis which is not

1040
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,970
really the case

1041
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,820
CBD comes from cannabis obviously in the

1042
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:25,449
CBD that we sell comes from cannabis and

1043
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:27,880
it's the legal definition of hemp which

1044
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:29,829
is a cannabis plant that has less than

1045
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,619
0.3 THC in it

1046
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:34,329
so we sell that so you're talking about

1047
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:36,130
the difference between industrial hemp

1048
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:39,069
which is really much of pretty much a

1049
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,390
beanpole that is really used really

1050
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,800
grown for its stock that's it's just

1051
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:43,779
like breeding dogs in a different way

1052
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,690
it's a chihuahua to coordinate feed corn

1053
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,340
yeah that's all the time we have let's

1054
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:51,119
hear it once again it's a fantastic and

1055
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,120
enlightening panel
