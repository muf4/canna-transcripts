you okay well uh we are in a an

29
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,920
interesting uh period of time I'm sure

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,000
you've been uh hearing throughout the

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,079
day some of the things that are evolving

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,680
and changing in the regulatory framework

33
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:37,399
with regards to cannabis and uh one of

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,720
our sort of guiding principles uh here

35
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,719
with the thean group located here in

36
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,158
Slovenia is that the research in the

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:49,039
world of cannabis has been sort of

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,719
limited and biased by the uh the legacy

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,520
of our uh prohibition and our regulatory

40
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,879
approach and now as we move into a more

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,640
modern and an

42
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:04,239
open-minded uh approach to cannabis we

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,960
hope to see a a opening a broadening of

44
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:11,919
the approach to research in cannabis and

45
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,878
uh and also an increased investment in

46
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,598
that so that means that there should be

47
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:20,518
some new things that are possible that

48
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:22,399
haven't been before um so first you know

49
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,680
it's a it's an optimistic view it's an

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,319
idealistic view I'd like to First just

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,400
ask the panelists um in your experience

52
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,719
uh do these changes

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,360
regulations uh mean that there will be

54
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,318
um new opportunities in cannabis

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,200
research or how would you like to see

56
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,598
these uh potential changes in regulation

57
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:46,238
affect that um I can talk for Slovenia

58
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,119
unfortunately we don't have yet uh the

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,719
new

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,800
regulation but I hope as Government

61
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:56,080
promised uh we will have it soon and I

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,239
think it will be also easier to uh

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,640
research the plant the Cannabis is

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,319
actually very much uh

65
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,679
research plant most research plant on

66
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:10,518
the planet but still we are failing on

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,280
the preclinical clinical trials and real

68
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,519
life uh data you know we have

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,158
high uh I don't know science and all

70
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,158
that but it on the field of medicine

71
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,919
nothing changed actually in the last few

72
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,639
years this is our goal so you you

73
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,919
mentioned that the cannabis plant is one

74
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,000
of the most studied uh plants uh in the

75
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,079
world and yet you you say that the the

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,120
real relevancy and applicability of that

77
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,080
um data and the science doesn't really

78
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,480
uh impact medicine and and its practical

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,560
use what would have to change um in

80
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,518
order for that to first we have to

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,959
change narrative and uh you know uh uh

82
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,319
about uh cannabis as it whole because uh

83
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,280
until when the mainstream professionals

84
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:04,158
or medicines is a priori against the

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Cannabis you cannot do really changes uh

86
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:11,280
then uh another big thing uh is how to

87
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,598
convince the industry to support

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,919
cannabis research we know the Pharma

89
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,399
industry is supporting clinical trials

90
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:23,360
all all over the world because they have

91
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:26,159
their own benefits uh but in the area of

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,639
cannabis research you don't really get

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,280
any

94
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,439
funds not the state funds not in

95
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,038
Slovenia and mostly Europe so this

96
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,120
should change as soon as

97
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:41,680
possible and what about you um you want

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,600
to tell us what your experience is and

99
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,319
how the regulatory framework is or isn't

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,400
encouraging research and and what kind

101
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,399
of changes you'd like to see okay in

102
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:55,000
terms of it depends from country to

103
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:57,879
Country I know better the situation in

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Portugal so Portugal was first country

105
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,439
in Europe to legalize the production of

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,680
Canabis and processing of Canabis for

107
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,160
medical

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,439
purposes this law came in July

109
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,800
2018 but it was of course a slow process

110
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,560
first it came as a surprise many people

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
didn't believe it that it would be

112
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,759
approved it was of course there were two

113
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,720
or three companies already ready to

114
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,960
start one of done till big multinational

115
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,680
but then local companies a few reacted

116
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,359
fast to start

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,439
producing but it was just they were just

118
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,720
growing no real

119
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,000
research we as

120
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,080
also say that in Portugal science means

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,560
European money no European money no

122
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,159
science private or

123
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,120
public and so 2018 this was at the end

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
of framework at Horizon 2020 so money

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,038
for research was

126
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:58,680
ending and the new framework Horizon

127
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,680
2030 was coming and there is always here

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,120
at that period between the end of one

129
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,360
framework and beginning of next and to

130
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,519
make it worse so on beginning of the

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,919
Horizon 2030 framework it came pandemic

132
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:15,000
and everything stopped

133
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:17,159
it uh and with pandemic everyone start

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,918
talking about the recovery and

135
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,240
resilience plan that somehow made

136
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:27,000
investments in the framework of horizon

137
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,079
2030 to delay meaning that first the

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,279
recover resilience and Recovery money

139
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:36,159
came that despite this was decided in

140
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:38,439
2020 only in 2023 start arriving to the

141
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,039
European countries and it's still going

142
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:46,680
now the good news is that the 2030

143
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:49,839
Horizon um monies programs it started

144
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,478
now now we see it happening so there are

145
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,839
lots of gr

146
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,478
submissions and I can't say to my

147
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,719
surprise immediately but thinking better

148
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,680
yeah it was happening now because these

149
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,240
monies there were no grants for research

150
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,319
for many years since

151
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,079
201819 but now that there are these

152
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,759
grants submissions in Portugal I see

153
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:16,079
that several companies are investing in

154
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,520
research uh goes from technology it can

155
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:22,719
go to growth growth technology

156
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:25,560
production Pro processing but several

157
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,520
Growers and processing companies are

158
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,079
actually uh submitting grants to do

159
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,959
preclinical

160
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,519
studies

161
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:38,519
so it's happening you know these

162
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:41,359
processes never go widely massively some

163
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,598
companies they are to lead they are

164
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,120
Beginnings they

165
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:49,478
pioneers and has these companies are

166
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,439
putting these new projects with PR

167
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:55,360
clinical tests so private sector working

168
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,120
with medicine schools with Pharmacy

169
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,919
schools they will bring more in future

170
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,519
so I think it start happening

171
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,598
um this is Portugal in Germany now also

172
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,478
with legalization and this is Germany

173
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:13,240
things I think will go much much faster

174
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:16,318
uh also with Horizon 2030 there we will

175
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,319
see definitely preclinical studies

176
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,479
going clinical studies it's another

177
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,158
division we are not talking about

178
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,800
investing a few hundreds of thousand or

179
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,158
even one or two million it's big big

180
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,038
Investments then it will be required or

181
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,958
governmental really governmental

182
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,038
programs or the Far big farm industry to

183
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,639
come seriously into this but it's

184
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,199
happening I think it's starting there

185
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:45,559
will be big developments on the years to

186
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,879
come I just want to add Justin uh you

187
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,879
ask which kind of legislation I want I

188
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,320
want to have

189
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:55,439
legislation which would not uh limit the

190
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,560
you know uh

191
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,240
research and uh so the science can be

192
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,639
real science and not as many too many

193
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,000
times today uh politically correct

194
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,000
science and then legislation should

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,679
follow the real science otherwise we

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,120
will not you know otherwise we are in

197
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:19,359
catch22 for a long time thank you for

198
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,360
that understood um apologize because I

199
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
realize um I didn't give you guys an

200
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,440
opportunity here to to let the crowd

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,920
know um and the people here know what

202
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,440
you actually specialize in and work in

203
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,439
and so as a moderator I'm sorry I didn't

204
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,839
give you a chance to introduce

205
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,120
yourselves there it's such a big family

206
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,000
here at uh at the events that we do

207
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,240
sometimes we get very comfortable and

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,039
familiar with each other but why don't

209
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,000
you just real quickly for a minute um

210
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:47,240
let folks know what your work is in

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,559
cannabis and where that might um

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,320
influence your view on

213
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:58,518
Research uh our main work actually is

214
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,160
for last 10 years to follow kabinet

215
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:05,440
products which which are used by uh

216
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:09,399
patients from any Market black gray or

217
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,519
regular uh Market uh because this is the

218
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,600
only way that you have really good

219
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:19,120
insight into what is good what is not

220
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,240
good what helps and what not helps uh I

221
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,519
hope all those research as I said will

222
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,919
be legal very soon uh because the real

223
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,200
research should not be limited you know

224
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:34,719
by bureaucratic uh obstacles which

225
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,040
is uh actually the biggest problems

226
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,079
anywhere among funds of

227
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:44,919
course okay how about

228
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:48,439
you okay so complicated to Define my

229
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:50,479
company we are in business for 42 years

230
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,279
and we started by being Distributors of

231
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,278
analytical equipment we were founded by

232
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,600
PhD students from chemical engineering

233
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,078
but since beginning that we were also

234
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,320
doing was development of certain Key

235
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:06,319
Systems for people doing research

236
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,879
usually chemist departments chemic

237
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,879
engine departments biotechnology

238
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,838
departments Pharmacy schools so we

239
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,480
always

240
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,880
been also a kind of um not manufacturers

241
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,720
because we always developed

242
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,799
prototypes but somehow extraction became

243
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,000
always something that we were looking a

244
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,879
lot for and with legalization in Canabis

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,240
in

246
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,320
2018 uh

247
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,000
companies working on this area and

248
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,079
wanted extraction equipment we were the

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,519
ref so they start calling us to supply

250
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,599
equipment for extraction this is how we

251
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,919
entered in Canabis so we are in Canabis

252
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,200
by the technology not by the science of

253
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,000
uh the Therapeutics of Canabis we are

254
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,399
going there slowly but we entered by

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,559
technology so this is how we enter then

256
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,320
we expanded to post Harvest but in terms

257
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,078
of research and development we kept on

258
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,240
just expanding our knowledge and our

259
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,719
Technologies on all downstreams

260
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,839
processes of extraction and also more

261
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,560
extraction techniques we were initially

262
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,880
just CO2 superal for the extraction and

263
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:20,518
over time we start having ethanol

264
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:24,000
solvent L um and now also either carbons

265
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,679
extraction and all on streams at same

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,839
times because we are an ISO 90001

267
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:33,039
certified company and recently in

268
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,519
meantime we got ugp certified lab and

269
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,319
even more recently it was this last

270
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,839
quarter we got a license to do research

271
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,040
in Canabis because we were selling and

272
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,760
developing equipment but we could not

273
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:45,958
test equipment in the house we had to go

274
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,639
to the customers because we could not

275
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:52,879
have Canabis not even hemp in Portugal

276
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:56,519
hemp is more forbidden than Canabis

277
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,720
actually hemp in Portugal is fiber and

278
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:04,560
seeds flowers is a residue to be

279
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,440
destroyed so finally we got the license

280
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,359
for R&amp;D meaning we can have Canabis in

281
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,040
house and we can test so this

282
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,800
immediately we increas it the number of

283
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,278
technologies that we are

284
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:19,919
developing and with this new framework I

285
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:22,278
mentioned between our own projects and

286
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,919
together with uh universities and

287
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,799
Canabis companies we submitted for

288
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,360
Grants and with grants or without grants

289
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,599
we are going forward with the research

290
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,879
projects

291
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,720
um and it's expanding so it's

292
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:39,519
growing um in meantime we are also

293
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,000
getting um a certification in management

294
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:47,000
of innovation so we are going developing

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,440
very seriously these R&amp;D uh R&amp;D

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,120
Department in our company in which 80%

297
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,639
of work is Canabis

298
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:59,078
related and uh may I add I forgot to say

299
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:02,278
that our Institute is also uh cooran

300
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:04,120
organizing seminaries and uh education

301
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,480
courses on the faculty of Health

302
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,519
Sciences about cannabis because if we

303
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,839
don't start to teach you know new

304
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,799
students about cannabis yesterday not

305
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,399
tomorrow we will not have Professionals

306
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,799
for 10 years uh then we help also or

307
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,958
helped some startup

308
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:27,559
companies uh and with this cooperation

309
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,719
we also joined the space exploration we

310
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,758
were sending some

311
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,320
samples to the space you know you have

312
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:39,879
to follow somehow the so we are active

313
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,560
on many many fields great cannabis in

314
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,240
space that certainly sounds like

315
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,879
something new in the field of research

316
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,000
so uh there is a theme here though that

317
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,759
um we could reiterate we you you

318
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,720
mentioned again you know cannabis being

319
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:58,440
the most studied plant and yet we hear

320
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,399
how people involved in the industry um

321
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,440
uh as a matter of practice are unable to

322
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,919
conduct the research most relevant you

323
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,800
couldn't even bring in you know biomass

324
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:12,719
material from Cannabis to to figure out

325
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:15,439
how to extract it within your business

326
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,240
uh you have a difficulty um sometimes

327
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,360
being able to obtain material to to use

328
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,120
in the the practice of medicine and so

329
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,159
though it has been really studied and

330
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,959
has been really researched it hasn't

331
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:30,120
been done in the context of what's most

332
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,318
relevant and important um as we look as

333
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,720
a cannabis industry to move forward I

334
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:37,559
think that's got to be the emphasis in

335
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,600
our communication from the industry to

336
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,638
The Regulators about what needs to

337
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,720
happen um so can you point out maybe

338
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,278
we'll start with you um one piece of

339
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,399
something that's kind of new um and or

340
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:54,519
exciting to you a piece of research or a

341
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,799
development of a new technology in um in

342
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,039
in your part of the field of cannabis in

343
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,758
you know either extraction or

344
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,000
postprocessing

345
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,720
can I speak can I speak about

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,360
two as long as we have time good so well

347
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,360
uh we have to Fields is post Harvest and

348
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,440
it extraction purification so in post

349
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,519
Harvest and this is a quite Hot Topic

350
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,199
because bioburden

351
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,679
reduction it's a very serious

352
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:26,799
problem I I speak about lots of Growers

353
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,559
and say we will not have contaminations

354
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,159
I never had a contamination everyone

355
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,439
lies everyone has

356
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:37,559
contaminations and this is not us this

357
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,639
is Europe we have to count that are very

358
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,000
well defined limits everything has to be

359
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,720
analyzed it doesn't matter if it is gacp

360
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,078
or if it is GMP it has to be analyzed

361
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,519
limits are the same so when we have a

362
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:53,359
crop that is contaminated what to do

363
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:57,639
with uh people are using typically

364
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,560
radiation by ionizing um radiation B

365
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,318
gamma radiation Electron Beam or

366
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:07,318
x-rays um but this always affects

367
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:11,038
quality of flour loss ofin potential

368
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,038
loss of cannabinoids and flow oxidizes

369
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,400
get brownish there is a less of quality

370
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,240
and even worse in terms of Market

371
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,519
Commercial aspects in Germany nowadays

372
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,318
flower that is irradiated so that is

373
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,639
subject to ionizing

374
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,078
radiation it has to be Market as IR

375
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,120
radiated product and and people don't

376
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,960
want to buy

377
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,918
so there is new techn and all the other

378
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,000
Technologies even without having to put

379
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,960
on label like uh termal processes by

380
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,640
radio frequency or microwaves or plasma

381
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,319
or ozone all of these oxidize and flow

382
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,200
is affected but there is a brand new

383
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,480
technology American technology using

384
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,360
cryo pasturization

385
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,038
basically they freeze instantly to very

386
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,759
very low temperatures cryogenic

387
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,240
temperatures with leak nitrogen with

388
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:03,879
these microbes uh um molds bacteria is

389
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,679
killed instantly and flower doesn't

390
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,640
suffer it keeps all thein keeps all the

391
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,200
cannabinoids and even all these

392
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,799
pathogens that are eliminated that are

393
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,640
killed because this is a process in whe

394
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,079
there is a flow of nitrogen always

395
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,080
passing all these let's say corpuses of

396
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:25,199
these dead pathogens they are that are

397
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:28,359
very thin particles they are swept it

398
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,919
away so when packet this material will

399
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:34,759
not give that

400
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,000
smelly taste or on on moldy flavor so

401
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,679
you get high

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,558
quality and um you get a very high

403
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,440
quality product even starting with

404
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,519
highly contaminated product this is a

405
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,400
huge

406
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,720
advance I follow these bioburden

407
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,320
reduction Tech Technologies and this is

408
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,960
absolutely the very very big step this

409
00:18:53,319 --> 00:19:00,000
is next Generation bioburden uh

410
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,038
reduction uh in terms

411
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,119
extraction especially thinking medical

412
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,400
cannabis we go to German pharmacopia

413
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,839
that recommend say say say the

414
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,640
recommended technology CO2 extraction

415
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,918
meaning super critical fuid extraction

416
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,480
so at high pressures and temperatures

417
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:19,919
above ambient like 35 40

418
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,200
45 this is not a must but is a

419
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,280
recommended one and I agree that gives

420
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,919
you the GLE the best extracts at least

421
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:32,279
in terms of Purity and in in a

422
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,240
controlled way but we are traditionally

423
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,000
using dry flour when we look for other

424
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,759
techniques more in recreational like

425
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,319
hydrocarbons extraction that use fresh

426
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:47,119
frozen flowers so these extracts can

427
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:49,079
reach in tpin which is great because

428
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,239
fresh flour is far more tpin than a

429
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,359
dried flour this is great but then there

430
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,519
are problems of contaminations residual

431
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,000
residual solvents like propane and Bane

432
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:02,519
on the extracts to take them out that

433
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,400
means go away and in Europe it comes

434
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:10,918
legislation and limits is very easy is

435
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:14,600
no measurable residual solvents so this

436
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,120
doesn't go well with the highin content

437
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:20,439
if you have to put under VI L of time to

438
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:23,199
decreas now there are new developments

439
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,120
in CO2 extraction not in supercritical

440
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,000
but using cryogenic temperatures again

441
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:32,879
but not so cryogenic like 0 to minus 20

442
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,200
- 30° Centigrade so we have liquid CO2

443
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,720
with small amounts of Co solvent this

444
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,558
allow you to extract not from dry

445
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,839
flowers but also from fresh flowers

446
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,519
Frozen fresh flowers and so you get the

447
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,079
best of both worlds you get a very high

448
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,359
Purity extract very potent extract

449
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,839
coming out of the extractor potency is

450
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,279
typically of 80% even if you are

451
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,839
extracting from

452
00:20:54,279 --> 00:21:02,879
hemp and with a huge huge tpin potenti

453
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:05,439
concentration too exciting um so in in

454
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,240
both instances um you're you're looking

455
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:13,558
to get cold with Excuse me to do uh to

456
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,200
to have these new advances um uh Bojo do

457
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:19,319
you have something that you'd like to

458
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,240
speak to about um in the field of you

459
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,759
know medical application that's a new

460
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,000
area of research or do you want to tell

461
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:27,200
us why you're sending samples to space

462
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,880
um something

463
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:36,880
uh yeah about space you know um space

464
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:40,360
exploration last uh years it's uh quite

465
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:44,840
interesting story from China to USA and

466
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:47,599
India and um cannabis is uh one of the

467
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:51,639
plants who can which can

468
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:54,119
withstand uh high dose of of light

469
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,919
radiation uh very high and let's see

470
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:01,879
what uh damage can do or will do the

471
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:05,679
cosmic ation on the uh on the plants

472
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:08,600
then we also send some uh other cannabis

473
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,559
products to space and we want to test

474
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:14,959
then what is the difference if any when

475
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:18,599
those products come back uh from the

476
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,200
space so we don't expect anything we

477
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:24,959
will just uh follow the science or let's

478
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,240
see what will happen and maybe next year

479
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,360
on in next two years we will be able to

480
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,640
tell you more is there any conversation

481
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,158
about people being able to use cannabis

482
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,520
in space not yet but you never

483
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:43,679
know uh actually they uh it would be

484
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:47,440
very good for the uh astronauts because

485
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,400
of the all symptoms they can get like

486
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,880
anxiety or depression or whatever so

487
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,240
very good idea Justin okay but it might

488
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,559
be a little while before we see any

489
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,640
pictures of anybody with a joint in the

490
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:02,200
space station joint necessarily you have

491
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,640
other Administration Ro extracts extract

492
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,120
indeed indeed um and G how are we doing

493
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,679
on time you about three minutes and then

494
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,359
questions after no no okay got it well

495
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,840
then let's let's take a moment to some

496
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:19,079
things up um really quickly because the

497
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:22,798
the field of research in cannabis is

498
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,319
actually so big um that we could you

499
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,319
know in this moment just talk about a

500
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,558
couple of small aspects of it obviously

501
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,200
we're we're looking at at um the way

502
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:35,440
that these regulatory changes can

503
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,080
encourage um or limit research but when

504
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,440
you look at the plant itself um cannabis

505
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:45,480
produces at this last count something

506
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,480
close to 140 phyto uh cannabinoids it

507
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:52,599
has well over uh a 100 terpenoids

508
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,519
there's a a whole number of um

509
00:23:52,599 --> 00:24:00,038
flavonoids that is approaching that as

510
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:03,798
well as amines and am Ides and a whole

511
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:06,640
bunch of other phyto compounds over 500

512
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:09,639
in total that this one plant produces

513
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,080
okay now those interact with each other

514
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,840
those interact with each of your's endoc

515
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,038
canabo system in really unique ways and

516
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:18,959
a lot of times when research is done

517
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,079
that it starts with the supposition well

518
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,319
if we give cannabis to this person is it

519
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,158
effective for this but in fact I've just

520
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,079
mentioned that there's 500 different

521
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,799
variables you have to look at and

522
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:35,278
potentially control for to understand

523
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:38,759
this genotype this choar and and all of

524
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:41,278
the interactions with a person uh unique

525
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,558
uh conditions that have to be looked at

526
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,798
and accounted for and we're not even

527
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,440
talking about the

528
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:49,879
agronomics uh of how you grow and

529
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,038
cultivate the plant the extraction or

530
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,399
postprocessing um and then the many

531
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:56,359
industral applications far beyond just

532
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,439
medicine so the field of cannabis

533
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:01,359
science is actually really F and though

534
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,360
it seems like we've studied a lot you've

535
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,879
heard from folks here in the industry a

536
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,439
lot of that research hasn't been

537
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,880
directed into how we're going to really

538
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,278
utilize this plant to get all the

539
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,840
benefits out of it so what's new in

540
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,759
cannabis research will actually um a lot

541
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:19,119
more research that's what's needed

542
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,480
investment in it from a public and a

543
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,678
private sector and also investment in an

544
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,599
open-minded approach that just doesn't

545
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,840
look at things in really simple terms um

546
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:31,519
black and white cannabis good or bad

547
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,000
um and so hopefully that's the evolution

548
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,398
in the industry that we'll we'll be

549
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,319
taking forward appreciate your guys' uh

550
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,199
time and attention here I think uh and

551
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,519
gu's going to take us away can you

552
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,880
please uh give our panelists another

553
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,079
round of applause and thank them for

554
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,278

thank you all very much and if you have

556
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,798
questions I'm sure you can ask them cuz

557
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,720
we're going to take a 15minute coffee

558
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:57,038
and pastry break we have coffee and

559
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,038
pastries in the next hallway
