1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,370
this is what we were calling an

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,318
intellectual property law on cannabis

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,530
update it's not intended as an

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:13,440
introductory primer to the entire field

5
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,599
of copyrights patents trademarks and

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,250
trade secrets as they apply to the

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,199
cannabis industry it's really intended

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,789
as an update of a couple of new things

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,529
that have happened in the last year a

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,350
couple of new interesting things what

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:29,399
they're handing out the piece of paper

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,910
is my one pay my one piece of paper two

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,039
pages back two sides cheat sheet that is

14
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:38,640
kind of my intellectual property law

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:42,149
primer on two pieces of paper the first

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,590
page has a horizontal grid that compares

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,808
copyrights patents trademarks and trade

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,640
secrets which are the four basic

19
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:51,959
intellectual property tools on five

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,340
different criteria so you can kind of

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,530
get a feel for what the differences are

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,559
and then if you flip that over I created

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,439
a fictional product that attempts to

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,709
show how each of the the tools can be

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,688
brought to life in a real product and

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,000
the reason we're talking about this is

27
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:12,389
part of the reason is this is the kind

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,310
of work that I've been doing for four

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,228
decades in general clothing electronics

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,859
restaurants music TV film any kind of

31
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:25,709
industry you can think of I'm based in

32
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:32,310
San Diego California but get up here all

33
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:34,469
the time and about ten years ago a light

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,790
bulb went on that as this industry was

35
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,849
starting a more from an underground

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,740
economy to a real enterprise for

37
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,649
entrepreneurs and creative people and

38
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,169
businesses to help get the medicine

39
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,329
medicine out it dawned on me that was

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,950
only a matter of time before the

41
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:51,989
investors we're gonna start coming in

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,359
and saying this is I like your product I

43
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,759
like your business but how do I protect

44
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,349
my investment where's the collateral

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,670
where the copyrights where the patents

46
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,000
where the trademarks where the trade

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,409
secrets and so about ten eleven years

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,959
ago I just started learning everything I

49
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,909
could about the industry and taking what

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,639
I knew from intellectual property law in

51
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,259
general and applying it to this industry

52
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,729
and so

53
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,719
there's been quite a quite a few

54
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:20,429
developments in the last 10 or 11 years

55
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:22,489
you know you hear a lot at this

56
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,409
conference and all conferences about

57
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:28,259
branding you know figure out what your

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,149
brand is protect your brand I figure out

59
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,378
what your identity is what your personal

60
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,079
brand is but in my experience

61
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:39,389
particularly in the cannabis industry

62
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:42,450
branding without intellectual property

63
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:44,759
IP for short protection they go hand in

64
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,039
claw they go hand in glove if you have

65
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,959
IP protection but no brand that doesn't

66
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,669
do you much good if you have a brand but

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,950
no IP protection that doesn't do you

68
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,929
much good you put the two together now

69
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,419
you got something that's going to be of

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:02,219
interest down the road as you grow your

71
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:06,899
business now a lots happened in the last

72
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:08,459
year a lot of new developments given a

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,489
few minutes we have I'm just going to

74
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:15,709
touch on three or four of the ones that

75
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,039
I think you'll find most interesting

76
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,229
afterwards

77
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,519
I'll make myself available outside or

78
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,619
downstairs at the lobby bar depending

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,049
and I'll be happy to answer questions

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,519
but what's what's really different this

81
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:32,159
year what's changed in the last year

82
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,329
let's talk about for a moment trademarks

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,068
brand names logos brand identifiers

84
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:41,030
anything that identifies your brand from

85
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:44,518
somebody else's brand Exxon Kodak Xerox

86
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:49,739
mrs. Fields Apple so forth and so on

87
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:53,069
those are all trademarks the Nike swoosh

88
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,310
it's a trademark the Yahoo yodel that's

89
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:59,189
a trademark all these brand identifiers

90
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,090
z' that separate your brand from the

91
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,289
competitors brand this is a hot area

92
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,519
before we talk about what's changed

93
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,280
what's talk about what hasn't changed

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,359
what hasn't changed and it's still the

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,750
big conundrum

96
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,609
for the cannabis industry is that the US

97
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,478
Patent and Trademark Office PTO for

98
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:21,629
short will still not allow a u.s.

99
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:25,169
trademark registration for anything that

100
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:27,750
is cannabis contains cannabis

101
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:33,689
or touches cannabis so by touching

102
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:36,930
cannabis I mean retail stores testing

103
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:40,079
labs and things like that delivery

104
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,090
services so we have a real problem in

105
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,519
this industry in getting federal

106
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:48,389
trademark protection for the cannabis

107
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:50,490
industry that's a challenge that's what

108
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:53,189
people like me like we like challenges

109
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,389
so we spend a lot of time trying to

110
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,300
figure out what the alternative

111
00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:00,659
strategies are now what has changed in

112
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:05,759
the last year is because in on December

113
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:09,140
20th of 2018 the farm bill of 2018 was

114
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,610
signed starting last year 2019 the

115
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,189
trademark the federal trademark office

116
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:19,560
started allowing trademark applications

117
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:22,199
for hemp and CBD derived products or

118
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,160
hemp derived CBD products with less than

119
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,170
0.3 percent THC this is monumental

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,240
breakthrough for the trademark office

121
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,250
because for the last 10 years the

122
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,680
federal trademark office has had a total

123
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,240
block blanket wall against anything

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,689
trademark any kind of trademark

125
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,670
applications pardon me for cannabis or

126
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,980
CBD

127
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,830
so if you are or intend to be in the CBD

128
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,080
business you now have the opportunity to

129
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:53,069
get some federal trademark protection

130
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,539
and just in December six weeks ago we

131
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:57,569
finally started seeing the first

132
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,689
trademark registrations actually being

133
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:03,990
issued and granted for CBD products

134
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:08,819
that's new that's news we also think

135
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:11,610
that now let me back up the challenge

136
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:16,529
with CBD applications or applications

137
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:19,920
for CBD products is the trademark office

138
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:22,439
will no longer use the Controlled

139
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,020
Substances Act as a basis for rejecting

140
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,610
your federal trademark application but

141
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,879
it will cite the Food Drug and Cosmetic

142
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:34,370
Act which doesn't allow orally

143
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:37,379
ingestible products to be marketed

144
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,319
commercially at least as far as the FDA

145
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:40,899
is concerned

146
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,209
so the Patent and Trademark Office will

147
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:46,509
reject a trademark application for

148
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:48,219
orally ingested CBD products on the

149
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:52,029
basis of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act

150
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,440
not the Controlled Substances Act we

151
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,089
don't think that they're gonna do that

152
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,219
for sublinguals we think they're going

153
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:59,799
to draw a distinction between other

154
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,960
orally ingested products and sublinguals

155
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,449
why I'm not exactly sure

156
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,120
other than the FDA considers sublinguals

157
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:09,219
not to be nutritional supplements so

158
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,139
there are some opportunities there what

159
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,990
else can you do on the federal level if

160
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,310
you can't get a trademark registration

161
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,560
for your cannabis product or your

162
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,170
cannabis service or your CBD product

163
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,470
because it's orally ingested well you

164
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:26,230
got a you'll excuse the phrase plant

165
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:29,740
some seeds by filing trademark

166
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:33,540
applications for ancillary goods and

167
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:39,100
services clothing educational services

168
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:42,520
website information classes videos those

169

171
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:51,339
violate the Controlled Substances Act

172
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,310
because they aren't cannabis don't touch

173
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:55,599
cannabis don't contain cannabis so you

174
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,610

product but you can for ancillary goods

177
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,519
and services good thing to do build up

178
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,240
some protection plant some seeds for the

179
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,680
future what else

180
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,500
California well one of the things that's

181
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,319
changed in the last year is California

182
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,389
the fifth largest economy in the world

183
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,870
arguably therefore the most important

184
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:25,419
economy cannabis economy in the world

185
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,399
California now is allowing trademark

186
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,520
registrations for cannabis products and

187
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:32,468
services if you are licensed to provide

188
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,029
your product or your service by the

189
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,190
state of California that's a

190
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:38,168
prerequisite but you can get a trademark

191
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,690
registration for your cannabis product

192
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:42,460
or service in California which you can't

193
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,169
get federally given the fact that

194
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,960
California is the fifth largest economy

195
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:49,210
in the world that's pretty good by the

196
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,030
way most other states that allow for

197
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:55,450
either medical or recreational cannabis

198
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:59,289
also allow state trademark registrations

199
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:02,200
in the old days most trademark lawyers

200
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,699
were only concerned about federal

201
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,250
trademarks they didn't give to two hoots

202
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,560
about state trademarks but in this

203
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,440
economy and in this world where cannabis

204
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,750
is hindered by federal illegality state

205
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,970
trademark registrations really important

206
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,529
okay

207
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,970
by the way state of California will

208
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:21,549
allow you to file your trademark

209
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,340
application online something they didn't

210
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:26,439
allow until last year that's new you can

211
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,690
search for other trademark registrations

212
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,760
that have already been issued online

213
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,500
that's something new in the last twelve

214
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,419
months that you couldn't do a year ago

215
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,889
so you might as well before you file

216
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,689
your trademark applications spend your

217
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:39,189
time spend your money see if anybody

218
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,540
else has already gotten a trademark

219
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,060
registration for the same or similar

220
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:46,689
trademark so you don't run up against a

221
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:48,609
brick wall by the way the state what

222
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:53,230
also is new is the state of California

223
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:55,300
trademark unit is applying a much more

224
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,830
strict scrutiny looking much more

225
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:00,099
closely at California trademark

226
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,290
applications to make sure that they the

227
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,860
packaging and labeling is California

228
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:07,839
compliant if your packaging doesn't

229
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,669
comply with California law they will

230
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,009
reject the trademark application and

231
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:14,620
tell you to go back and fix it that's

232
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:17,590
new the fact that the trademark office

233
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,870
is looking at these trademark

234
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,530
applications much more closely what else

235
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,659
is new

236
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:28,029
last month Keva health versus Kiva

237
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:30,879
brands show hands everybody familiar

238
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,159
with Kiva edibles Kiva Edda mill has

239
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,629
been around for quite some time well

240
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:39,539
there's another company called Kiva

241
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:42,939
health a non cannabis company they sued

242
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,949
Kiva brands in federal court for

243
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,490
trademark infringement not state court

244
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,480
federal court for trademark infringement

245
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,519
claiming that Kiva Health had a

246
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,259
trademark registration Kiva brands was

247
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,149
infringing Kiva Brands Kiva edibles

248
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:01,240
filed a counterclaim a cross claim

249
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:03,490
saying hey not so fast Kiva health we

250
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,690
have unregistered common law trademark

251
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,330
rights based on our lawn

252
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,370
standing use of khiva for edibles in

253
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,740
California we may not have it registered

254
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:17,210
for edibles but we've got common law

255
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,519
rights based on our long-standing sale

256
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:23,210
of khiva branded products which is by

257
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,559
the way a valid legal doctrine you don't

258
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,740
have to have a trademark registration

259
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,750
it's really good to have one you're not

260
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,220
required by law to have one you have

261
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,220
these common law rights if you've been

262
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,490
selling the product unfortunately the

263
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,550
court dismissed

264
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:42,009
Keva brands counterclaims against kiva

265
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,419
health said sorry

266
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:47,419
cannabis is illegal under federal law

267
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:49,429
you're in federal court we're not going

268
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:52,969
to give your common law claims any

269
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:55,759
credence in federal court this is a game

270
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,860
changer for brands and for trademark

271
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,830
enforcement rights I think it means a

272
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:04,789
couple of things stay away from federal

273
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:06,740
court if you can build up your ancillary

274
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:09,559
trademark registrations on the federal

275
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,960
level for those non-radioactive products

276
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:14,239
and services clothing educational

277
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,120
services website information so forth

278
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,149
and so on and get your state trademark

279
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,389
registrations there's a possibility that

280
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,970
if you have more of your found found a

281
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:29,059
tional bricks in place you might be able

282
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:32,360
to avoid a similar fate that happened to

283
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:37,009
poor kiva brands also you know

284
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,590
hindsight's 20/20 but I'm thinking now

285
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:42,080
if I have a client that's being

286
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:45,019
threatened with trademark infringement

287
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,360
lawsuit by somebody I may not sit around

288
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,189
for too long waiting to see what happens

289
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,649
and going back and forth with the letter

290
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,770
writing and the phone calls and can't we

291
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:57,529
all be friends what I might do is I

292
00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:00,250
might go racing into state court here in

293
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:03,470
California and file a pre-emptive

294
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,259
trademark action called a declaratory

295
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,600
relief action in state court where I

296
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:11,539
think my client might get a better shake

297
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,600
from the judge than in federal court and

298
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:16,189
say judge we've been threatened my

299
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,470
clients been threatened with trademark

300
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,760
infringement by this other company I'm

301
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,950
filing suit

302
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,019
because I want a declaration from you

303
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,830
that we do have valid and enforceable

304
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:30,439
common law trademark rights and maybe

305
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,750
state trademark registrations too and I

306
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,370
want to preempt this and get this into

307
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,509
state court and keep it out of federal

308
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,539
court the federal court conundrum is

309
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:43,939
also rearing its ugly little head in

310
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:47,179
claims litigation claims that are coming

311
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:50,810
up now also in the patent and trade

312
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:53,870
secret arena ironically you can't get a

313
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:56,809
federal trademark registration for

314
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,049
cannabis products and services from the

315
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:02,000
Patent and Trademark Office you can't

316
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:04,399
get a trademark registration if you walk

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,590
in the patent door I'm sorry if you walk

318
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,889
in the trademark door but if you walk in

319
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,440
the patent door you can because there's

320
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,659
nothing in the federal patent law that

321
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,320
says the patent office is not allowed to

322
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:20,719
grant a patent for cannabis there is a

323
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,060
prohibition against granting a trademark

324
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,190
there's a specific prohibition by law

325
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:27,319
against granting a trademark

326
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,360
registration for cannabis but not for

327
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,140
patents so cannabis patents are issuing

328
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,110
by the dozens whether or not they'll be

329
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:38,360
enforced in federal court which is the

330
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,090
only place you can go to sue for patent

331
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,220
infringement same with copyrights you

332
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,590
can only go to federal court we don't

333
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,009
know yet these are the cases that are

334
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:52,730
starting to rear their heads now 2019

335
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:54,529
2020 and in the future when I any good

336
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,480
old days when I first started doing this

337
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:58,909
work ten years ago there were no

338
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,190
lawsuits nobody was suing everybody

339
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:02,870
anybody everybody was holding hands

340
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,380
singing Kumbaya we're all in this

341
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,789
together

342
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:10,340
then about 2014 2015 when Colorado

343
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:12,079
Washington Oregon went legal the stakes

344
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,840
started rising more money started

345
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,360
floating in and you started seeing non

346
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,790
cannabis companies suing cannabis

347
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,669
companies over cannabis parodies like a

348
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:28,459
she's instead of Hershey's and ganja joy

349
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:28,899
instead of almond joy and so forth and

350
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,040
so on

351
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,199
Starbucks filed some lawsuits you

352
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,319
started seeing non cannabis companies

353
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,680
suing cannabis companies over these

354
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,290
so-called parodies and that was where

355
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,279
most of the litigation was between 2014

356
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:46,659
and 2018

357
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:50,539
then 2018 2019 is when we started seeing

358
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:52,759
cannabis companies suing cannabis

359
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:55,549
companies hadn't seen any of that really

360
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,759
before 2018 but it was sort of the

361
00:15:55,549 --> 00:16:00,979
inevitable consequence of the increase

362
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,629
in the financial stakes that's taking

363
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,850
place and all the money that's floating

364
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:07,039
in and coming into the industry this has

365
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,860
happened for a hundred two hundred years

366
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,689
in our society as in as in - new

367
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,629
industries come online and become more

368
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,820
mature though the bigger players the

369
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:20,899
players are more aggressive realize or

370
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,820
after a period of time that they can use

371
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:25,459
the litigation system to [ __ ] their

372
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,260
competitors I don't like it I'm not

373
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,629
saying it's a good thing but it's

374
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:32,059
happening it happens all the time it

375
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:34,159
happens not just an industry but it's

376
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,409
starting to happen in this industry and

377
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,559
I think if I'm invited back next year

378
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:42,139
I'm predicting I'll probably have 10 or

379
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,869
12 different trademark copyright patent

380
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:46,370
trade secret infringement lawsuits where

381
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,679
one cannabis companies suing another

382
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,289
cannabis company to report to you it's

383
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:54,589
happening plan ahead that's my

384
00:16:51,289 --> 00:17:04,549
recommendation for 2020 let's see what

385
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:09,220
else is new in 2020 copyrights because

386
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:13,129
we can't get trademark registrations on

387
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,750
the federal level for cannabis products

388
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,449
for the illegality problem the

389
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:21,019
Controlled Substances Act copyright

390
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:24,410
registrations for your logos your

391
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:27,440
graphic designs like let's take the ICBC

392
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,779
logo it's got all this rich detail in it

393
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,570
it's got the bridge it's got the tower

394
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:34,730
it's got the sales it's got the blue

395
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:37,730
it's got the green that's what I call a

396
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,500
graphically rich logo it's not just a

397
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,750
horizontal line and a vertical line it's

398
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,569
got some real content to it

399
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:48,170
that graphically rich logo that you see

400
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:50,240
up there and which hopefully many of you

401
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,509
have to identify and distinguish your

402
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,670
brands those can also be registered not

403
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:58,759
just as trademarks but with the

404
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:01,820
Copyright Office not the letters ICBC

405
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:04,670
but all the graphics copyright protects

406
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:07,639
content graphics illustrations drawings

407
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:11,410
photographs computer programs so because

408
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,509
we can't get trademark registrations for

409
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,060
cannabis products copyright

410
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:20,210
registrations to be filed with the US

411
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,759
Copyright Office copyright gov very

412
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,799
simple fifty five dollars the best

413
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:29,119
bargain around you could do it online

414
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,740
yourself I'll be happy to do it or guys

415
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,750
people like me are happy to do it but

416
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,490
honestly if you have the bandwidth you

417
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,180
have the patience and want to open up an

418
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,410
account you can do it yourself what's

419
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,039
interesting about copyright

420
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,019
registrations for graphically rich logos

421
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,299
the Copyright Office doesn't care that

422
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:50,269
your business is a cannabis business

423
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:52,609
they don't have no prohibition against

424
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:55,369
granting a copyright registration to a

425
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:57,769
cannabis business they're agnostic you

426
00:18:55,369 --> 00:19:00,319
fill out the form right you pay the fee

427
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:02,319
you provide the specimen the the

428
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,869
evidence of what it is that you're using

429
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:09,349
your copyright on they're gonna register

430
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:11,000
that copyright for you and if somebody

431
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,579
infringes your copyright you get to go

432
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,559
to federal court not state court and we

433
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:16,849
don't know but we don't know how judges

434
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,859
in federal court are going to view

435
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:20,599
copyright infringement claims I think

436
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,949
they're gonna be favorable but I don't

437
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,659
know that for a fact yet but at least

438
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,370
you have the copyright registration and

439
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,710
you have something to hang your hat on

440
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:31,159
the other advantage of copyright

441
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,740
registrations and as a supplement to all

442
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,170
your trademark registrations is unlike

443
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,750
the trademark office which divides all

444
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,360
goods and services into 45 different

445
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,039
categories and you have to pay a filing

446
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,879
fee of either two hundred and

447
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,139
twenty-five dollars per category or two

448
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,450
hundred and seventy-five dollars per

449
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,850
category so if you want to file for

450
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,769
clothing and educational services and

451
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,609
website information that's going to be

452
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:59,528
three cat

453
00:19:55,609 --> 00:20:04,519
at 225 bucks a pop the Copyright Office

454
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:06,138
essentially has one category $55 so if

455
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,329
your cell you're putting your trademark

456
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:10,908
on cannabis and clothing and somebody

457
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:12,618
puts it on lunchboxes and bed sheets you

458
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,450
can make a claim against them for trade

459
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:16,999
for copyright infringement without

460
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,028
having to pay fifty five dollars times

461
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:22,009
three four or five categories I'm really

462
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:24,079
bullish on copyright applications for

463
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:32,329
the cannabis industry what do you think

464
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:34,428
are we done oh four or five minutes you

465
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:35,960
have a question do you mind taking a few

466
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:37,580
questions I'll take a few questions

467
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:45,048
we got time you let me know when we're

468
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:47,028
done in Doyle so it's growing litigation

469
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:48,798
over the trademark registrations if

470
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:51,378
someone is to go to federal court and

471
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,628
lose what type of liability do you think

472
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:54,998
their attorneys are taking on and what

473
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,528
is the risk for malpractice

474
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:59,450
advising then on something we expect to

475
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:08,528
go to court and be challenged and most

476
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:08,528
likely not well it's a risk obviously

477
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:16,278
anytime you're you're out on the cutting

478
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:18,829
edge whether you're just giving advice

479
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,419
or whether you're litigating when you're

480
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:22,249
the lawyer and you're out on the cutting

481
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,899
edge whatever industry you're in whether

482
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:29,118
it's cannabis or weapons of mass

483
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:30,979
destruction or alcohol and other

484
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:33,079
controlled substances there's always a

485
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,349
risk that the advice that you give a

486
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:38,449
client is somehow going to backfire we

487
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:40,398
try to mitigate that risk we try to use

488
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,470
our brains we try to talk to our

489
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:44,298
colleagues we try to talk to the other

490
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,899
partners in our law firm and make sure

491
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:50,538
we're not making obvious mistakes so as

492
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:54,079
to mitigate that risk but you know when

493
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:55,638
you're out at the cutting edge sometimes

494
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,849
you got to push the envelope I mean

495
00:21:55,638 --> 00:22:03,288
that's part of our job and whether or

496
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:06,168
not something rises to the level of

497
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:09,109
malpractice boy that's it that's a tough

498
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:12,250
one that's for others who are

499
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:15,289
smarter than I am to answer definitively

500
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:18,470
but you know it's part of the reason

501
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:22,670
lawyers charge what they charge honestly

502
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,920
I mean I lawyer hourly rates if any of

503
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:29,110
you have hired lawyers you know they're

504
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:33,279
pretty high no pun intended

505
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:38,240
yeah but part of the reason is because

506
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:41,779
we have to cover that risk and pay rate

507
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,308
outrageous malpractice rates per year to

508
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,470
cover those risks when we push the

509
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:46,220
envelope if we don't want to push the

510
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,900
envelope

511
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,269
we shouldn't be in the cannabis industry

512
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,220
we should Rick you know we should we

513
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:55,429
should represent yogurt companies and

514
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,779
stuff like that how much I'm not sure

515
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:04,850
that answers your question but I'm

516
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:06,168
trying as a copyright or some of the

517
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:08,359
other ways you're suggesting in the

518
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:11,509
ancillary fashion against someone who

519
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,678
else so I I didn't hear the beginning of

520
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:14,329
the questioning guy oh could you repeat

521
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,890
it yeah she said are there companies who

522
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:18,798
have successfully defended their

523
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,030
copyright right so you you suggest

524
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,379
getting a copyright instead of a

525
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:23,089
trademark or something like that and

526
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,200
then you have a chance so are there

527
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:25,759
examples of people using that

528
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,240
successfully in court to defend their

529
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,910
property

530
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,919
you know I right now the amount of

531
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:34,370
litigation that we're seeing in the

532
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,520
cannabis industry I can reel I can

533
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:40,668
almost literally count on two hands I

534
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,460
mean there's just very little litigation

535
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,309
right now that's out there I think

536
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,100
there's gonna be a lot more this year I

537
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:51,319
haven't seen any copyright infringement

538
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,730
lawsuits I've seen trademark

539
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,129
infringement lawsuits patent

540
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,890
infringement lawsuits trade secret

541
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:01,160
infringement lawsuits but not copyright

542
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,860
but I'm waiting and I'm ready to go when

543
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,570
you know if and when a client has the

544
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:09,500
right set of facts but I think it's

545
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:12,230
coming and as far as on the trademark

546
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,700
side well if there's if there's a

547
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,798
plaintiff and the defendant and the

548
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,750
lawsuit gets down the road there's

549
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:20,190
usually one winner and one loser so

550
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,619
there's usually one of each at the

551
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,970
that at the end of that fight there you

552
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:29,658
go thank you so much let's hear it again

553
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,659
brandman that was very elucidating
