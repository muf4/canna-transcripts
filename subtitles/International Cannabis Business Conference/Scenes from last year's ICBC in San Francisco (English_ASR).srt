1
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:39,539
this is international business

2
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,429
conference and many people who came here

3
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,369
kind of took a chance bought a ticket

4
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,289
wasn't sure what to expect right and the

5
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,599
feedback I'm getting is I can't believe

6
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,409
this I didn't know what was going to be

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,550
this good what they mean by good is

8
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,949
information and networking and just the

9
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:59,339
general attitude of the people here just

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,650
want to thank Alex and the dial for

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,759
putting on it and that really blends

12
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:08,159
activism and business in a really really

13
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,489
great way and I believe in karma I

14
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,519
believe in community I believe in love

15
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,569
and understanding and I actually believe

16
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,939
if you hold true to some of those

17
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,289
tenants and precepts that you're only

18
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,629
going to benefit yourself for so many

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,310
reasons and in my case it's actually

20
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:25,189
helped me make money also so it's this

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,960
new win-win situation that's happening

22
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,700
with the cannabis industry in particular

23
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,439
and I think that's what people are very

24
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,560
surprised about that that they can make

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,840
money they can be successful and no one

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,519
else has still to lose we just wrapped

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,710

do with people are actually overly

35
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,849
excited and happy that we have decided

36
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,118
to dedicate so much of this to culture

37
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:06,379
politics and advocacy and I'm

38
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:09,318
tremendously happy with the feedback

39
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:12,318

40
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,479
citizens can change the world it is

00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,289
