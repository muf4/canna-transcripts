112
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:00,939
cannabis cultivator and the founder of

113
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,729
bellavista cannabis I'm a fifth

114
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:06,250
generation farmer on our organic

115
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:10,360
certified certified organic farm two

116
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,949
hours east of Toronto Ontario cannabis

117
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,150
medically under various licenses

118
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:17,379
licenses for ten years and as I've been

119
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,870
working with the land

120
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:22,330
I've looked out across the industrial

121
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,478
cannabis production landscape and know

122
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:28,978
that there is a better way industrial

123
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:31,329
cannabis cultivation is expensive it is

124
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,810
sometimes not so good for the

125
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,500
environment

126
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:40,750
and quality is often sacrificed for

127
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:45,629
quantity at bellavista we know that in

128
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:48,038
terms of work and input for plant life

129
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:51,968
nature has been doing a pretty good job

130
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,318
for countless millennia we look to

131
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:56,860
embrace these natural systems and

132
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,930
processes amplify them and put them to

133
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,210
work for us and we'll tell you a little

134
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,728
bit about that today we are asking for

135
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,629
$800,000 in start-up capital and the

136
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:06,370
majority of that will be going to a

137
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,610
greenhouse to execute our three-year

138
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,218
plan now we'll tell you a little bit

139
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,270
about our farm my great-great

140
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:19,930
great-grandfather settled on our farm

141
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:22,329
170 years ago and this is my grandfather

142
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,129
here that would be his grandson this is

143
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:28,060

145
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:35,050
Robert Michael Matthews the fifth look

146
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:39,310
to carry our family tradition into a new

147
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,598
era with bellavista cannabis so I'll

148
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,360

149
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:46,180

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,479

combined with my 20 years farming

154
00:06:54,908 --> 00:07:03,370
experience is really an ideal skillset

155
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:05,310
to bring our cannabis plan to market our

156
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,750
farm has been certified organic since

157
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:11,110
1999 we've developed and maintained

158
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,180
various sales channels to deliver our

159
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,879

160
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,069

164
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:30,639
in terms of cannabis in 2008 I partnered

165
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:32,829
with red canoe cannabis to serve medical

166
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,769
patients under the MMAR licensing system

167
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:39,550
and in 2014 we sold genetics and flower

168
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:42,639
to tweet incorporated now I'll tell you

169
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,348
a little bit about our method and I'll

170
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,168
probably provide a little bit of context

171
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:49,300
with a quote from a Canadian Press

172
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:51,758
journalist Laura Cain where she notes

173
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,079
that as Canada nears cannabis

174
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,210
legalization

175
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:59,408
it was only so green for the environment

176
00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:00,638
we aim to change that we look to work

177
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:05,769
with nature

178
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:08,769
not without so one interesting example

179
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:11,439
of this is the power of compost one very

180
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:13,838
large massive pile of compost consisting

181
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,899
of manure and what chips can produce

182
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:19,300
heat temperature heights of 180 degrees

183
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,319
Fahrenheit that's 80 degrees or 82

184
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,259
degrees exactly

185
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,020
Celsius that's extremely hot and so with

186
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:28,629
compost heat recovery system and heat

187
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:32,828
exchange fans we can harness this energy

188
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:35,318
source can heat buildings lower your

189
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:39,218
heating costs with the supplementary

190
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:41,228
heating furthermore the decomposition of

191
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,810
this matter is great growing medium it

192
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,870
can be used for compost teas for a

193
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,149
foliar sprays of course and your to

194
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,929
inoculate the rhizosphere the root

195
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:54,539
system the root zone of of plants with

196
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:57,549
beneficial microbes beneficial bacteria

197
00:08:54,539 --> 00:09:02,639
the list goes on and on and on this is

198
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:05,289
just one of the many different tools and

199
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,708
concepts that we have the ability to do

200
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:11,329
on our farm so let's look at our

201
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:14,299
competitive analysis

202
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,160
in terms of this this table shows cash

203
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:19,009
production cost this is a metric in

204
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,929
which we look to outperform our cost

205
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:24,110
saving strategy involves reductions

206
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:28,759
across the board in this way

207
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:31,550
we can bring our continuous innovation

208
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:36,708
and the integration of our systems that

209
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:39,949
are all on farm to produce low cost but

210
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:43,639
very very high quality farm grown

211
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,170
cannabis the next step is the

212
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,449
construction of our greenhouse it'll be

213
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,620
a 5,000 square-foot gutter connect

214
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,940
greenhouse we're currently in

215
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,889
discussions with contractors suppliers

216
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,430
and engineers and can begin construction

217
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:56,958
in as little as 12 weeks our three-year

218
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,969
plan will be executed in two phases

219
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,309
phase one has seen the completion of our

220
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,200
business plan we are will we will be

221
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,359
applying for micro licenses as soon as

222
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,610
they become available our greenhouse

223
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,850
construction is penciled in here for

224
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,709
early 2019 but again we can do sooner

225
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,320
our first harvest and testing is

226
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:17,989
projected before late 2019 and finally

227
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,700
phase 2 is the beginning of our build

228
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,589
out for our vertical integration plan

229
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,209
and this is just the beginning of it

230
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:24,890
here with our processing facility

231
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:28,389
construction so we can take our farm

232
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:31,100
growing products and move into extracts

233
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:32,449
we are seeking $100,000 in start-up

234
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,850
capital to execute our three-year plan

235
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,589
the majority of the cost will go towards

236
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,139
our greenhouse and we expect in addition

237
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:40,970
to our core team to hire a staff of five

238
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:45,250
individuals in the beginning for

239
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:49,339
day-to-day operations we have the team

240
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,639
the skillset the experience the farmland

241
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,140
and the passion and the vision and we

242
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,948
are very excited about the future of

243
00:10:54,139 --> 00:11:02,269
bellavista cannabis thank you

244
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:05,088
I have a very simple question so which

245
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:07,448
is a technical question when you grow

246
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:12,050
cannabis under the current regime

247
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:15,708
there's strict rules around my micro

248
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:18,620
testing the amount of bacteria and

249
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:20,388
microbes on on the product the challenge

250
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,230
that organic

251
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:27,739
cultivation has is there are a lot of

252
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,129
alive organism in the soil how do you

253
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:33,459
plan on resolving that issue and produce

254
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:38,600
organic product that passes the

255
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:40,458
regulatory requirements right and so to

256
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,230
the best of my knowledge so far I don't

257
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,568
know if they're gonna paint with one

258
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,850
broad brush and count all different

259
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:48,528
types of bacteria as being unsafe for a

260
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,589
consumption or if they will just specify

261
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:54,438
the more unsafe ones right we would

262
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:58,129
definitely be assessing the situation as

263
00:11:54,438 --> 00:12:00,669
things move forward foliar sprays you

264
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:07,579
know in such a case might not be used in

265
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:09,588
flowering and in terms of maybe soil

266
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,328
bacteria or something

267
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,399
I just think where there's a will

268
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:18,258
there's a way maybe it would be some

269
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:22,009
type of mulch cover the beneficials are

270
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:23,539
completely safe so yes it doesn't really

271
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,399
matter what the regulations are going to

272
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:27,139
be with that in terms of the bacterial

273
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,938
count and what what they'll be

274
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:31,188
identifying as safe or unsafe but yeah

275
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:32,719
we have our eyes on that thank you and

276
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:34,308
great pitch and thank you for coming all

277
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,829
the way to Ontario to be here today it's

278
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:38,480
fantastic my question for you is I'm

279
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:40,099
wondering if you can tell us about one

280
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,048
of the patients that you worked with

281
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,909
early on in your cannabis cultivation

282
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:45,139
that has inspired you to go down the

283
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:47,988
path of being a medicine maker

284
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,159
yeah really quite early on as I'm

285
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:51,709
actually like when we part when I

286
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,828
partnered with red canoe cannabis in

287
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:56,178
2008 I saw a lot of different cases of

288
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:59,138
different patients with different needs

289
00:12:56,178 --> 00:13:02,149
one in particular had Crohn's and

290
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:05,269
medical cannabis was a game changer it

291
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:08,149
was a life changer we even had to come

292
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:11,269
out to our gardens to work and that was

293
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,739
very much therapeutic and of itself she

294
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,308
did also require quite a lot of cannabis

295
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:19,800
as well so that was kind of a success

296
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:21,569
story in the medical realm

297
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,919
thanks for taking the opportunity to

298
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,810
tell us about your passion and really

299
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,659
appreciate that it obviously does come

300
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:29,969
through I have sort of two questions I

301
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,219
have a I have a curiosity question and I

302
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:36,600
have like a dragon's den kevin o'leary

303
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,340
type question also so the clocks tickin

304
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,899
so I'll ask you the curiosity one first

305
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,269
and if the mic swings back I'll ask you

306
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,669
the tougher one you've got ten years of

307
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:45,990
experience cultivating organic outdoor

308
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,089
cannabis yeah

309
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,240
the federal government is contemplating

310
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,250
licensing organic for legal growth and

311
00:13:51,240 --> 00:14:00,990
distribution why the switch to green

312
00:13:53,250 --> 00:14:02,490
house what motivated that decision about

313
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,490
trying to decide if I should be green

314
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:16,769
house or do outdoor for extracts or oils

315
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:29,430
and so on right and yeah we'd love to do

316
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:33,360
green house specialty craft stuff having

317
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:36,449
grown organic outdoors obviously you you

318
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,100
sort of swayed away from growing longer

319
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:42,840
flowering sativas yeah yeah you

320
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,940
surprised like I can get crops

321
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,830
I guess they took my pictures anyways

322
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,910
we're gonna add one more minute to the

323
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,129
questioning around so everybody within

324
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:54,809
five minutes instead of four if you

325
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:57,779
could bring my presentation back up that

326
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:00,869
would be cool so yeah so if you could

327
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:04,529
explain getting into sativas outdoors

328
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,539
and yeah yeah I hear a lot of that but

329
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,509
I've had great success growing sativas

330
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:12,449
outdoors the the flower in many cases

331
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:14,819
might not be quite as as dense as it

332
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,340
could be given our temperate region

333
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,650
right but you have a great great THC

334
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,740
some of my favorite products I'm all

335
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:26,250
about THC myself for my own consumption

336
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:28,139
so yeah Steve is growing out into

337
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,240
November frost can become an issue but

338
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:33,319
it takes like minus 7 or something to

339
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,320
really get into doing some damage

340
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,370
all right so I'll ask the I'll ask the

341
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,129
tough question we're gonna get into

342
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,740
numbers here a little bit then you've

343
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:48,269
you've at you've got an $800,000 ask and

344
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,799
you said a majority of that is for

345
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,090
greenhouse construction about half of

346
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,769
that's actually for greenhouse but we

347
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,080
can start sortin dollars

348
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,029
you've got $300,000 in salary and wages

349
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,220
here which is a substantial chunk of

350
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:02,669
this over three years who's that going

351
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,870
to is it the sort of core team or is it

352
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:05,849
these individuals that you're planning

353
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,610
to hire or a mix of the two well let me

354
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:13,279
tell you this we're in when all comes

355
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,279
down to it we're gonna be needing and

356
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:26,000
appreciate that that's good the guy with

357
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,000
the monies at this end so

358
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:37,039
all right and here we have Thomas Fraley

359
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,110
from Bavarian farms lab testing they're

360
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,000
an independent lab providing cannabis

361
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,100
producers with regulatory mandated batch

362
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,089
testing services and scientific support

363
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,480
let's hear it for Thomas Fraley thank

364
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,149
you

365
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,800
hello ICBC as mentioned my name is

366
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:54,139
Thomas Fraley I'm the president and

367
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,669
founder of Bavarian laboratories and I'm

368
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,769
here to talk to you today about why an

369
00:16:55,669 --> 00:17:00,019
investment in cannabis testing is not

370
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,000
only a good financial opportunity but

371
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,929
critical for the success of our industry

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,480
as a whole

373
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:07,159
Health Canada mandates lab testing of

374
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,019
each batch of cannabis or cannabis

375
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,610
product before its release for sales to

376
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:12,558
consumers there's been a lot of

377
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,479
attention and investment in the industry

378
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,668
and scaling up production capabilities

379
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,500
the very little focus paid attention to

380
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,699
the capacity in the testing market to

381
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:26,808
test these products that are being

382
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:28,850
produced there we go so more a little

383
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:30,558
bit about us we have it was an 800

384
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:32,839
square foot site located in masago

385
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:36,259
beside Pearson Airport we filed for an

386
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:38,209
LD application in May of 2018 we raised

387
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:40,308
just north of 1 million dollars in our

388
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,289
early financing activities we have an

389
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:45,849
anticipated go live data of our testing

390
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:48,200
services and fall of 2018 we are seeking

391
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:49,939
$500,000 of additional financing from

392
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,130
canopy rivers for capital equipment

393
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,289
upgrades we will spend this money very

394
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,059
fast likely within the first year likely

395
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,889
within the first six months as mentioned

396
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:59,298
our team brings together 40 plus years

397
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:02,179
of testing and life sciences industry

398
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:03,200
experience prior to beginning this

399
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,940
venture our is working with

400
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,919
sigma-aldrich corporation down in the

401
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,470
United States and contract manufacturing

402
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,330
partnerships for diagnostic tests I have

403
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,769
some experience with plant adilyn local

404
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:15,859
chemistry through the National Research

405
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:17,509
Council of Canada in Saskatchewan and by

406
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,009
some experience with plant tissue

407
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:21,558
culture and Relic Euler biology as well

408
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:23,658
to our quality manager's name is Dallas

409
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:26,119
Takeo Qi not only has he accomplished

410
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:28,760
analytical chemists but he has 24 years

411
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,769
of testing lab auditing experience it is

412
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,470
very nice to have a quality manager who

413
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:35,808
was an ISO auditor as well - Angelica

414
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,370
Gordon is our lead analytical chemist

415
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:39,048
prior to joining us her and her

416
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,069
colleagues set up in ran a pesticide

417
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:42,109
testing lab

418
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:43,519
in Colombia where they screened all

419
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:45,619
types of produce from across South

420
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,809
America for over 200 different types of

421
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:49,639
pesticides our operations and

422
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:52,039
administration manager Paul Callan dong

423
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,280
joins us from Estee Lauder MAC Cosmetics

424
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,500
where previously he was in charge of

425
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,149
consumer event strategy and execution we

426
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,859
currently have an open position for our

427
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,720
lead microbiologist if there are any

428
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:06,079
talented microbiologist in the audience

429
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,670
please come chat with me afterwards here

430
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,259
are some of the here are the tests that

431
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,450
are required by Health Canada currently

432
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:13,579
on each batch of dried cannabis or oil

433
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,559
product released to the market the regs

434
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:17,449
for concentrates and food products are

435
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,339
still TBD but we imagine they'll mirror

436
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,170
this somewhat with the exception of the

437
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:22,970
foreign matter test and dry weight test

438
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,470
which are fairly easy conducting the

439
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,360
remainder of these tests requires a

440
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,730
fairly advanced chemistry lab and a

441
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,500
fairly advanced microbiology lab the

442
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,329
same equipment and processes that we

443
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,799
invest in to bring these testings online

444
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:35,389
can also be used to provide our

445
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,549
customers with more custom bespoke

446
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,780
testing services to help support them

447
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:41,629
with their process and product

448
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:43,759
development this is what we see the

449
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,070
cannabis market looking like under the

450
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,109
cannabis Act here we created kind of a

451
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:50,269
heat map with red being the area of

452
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:52,309
hottest business opportunity for us this

453
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,200
is the cultivators and micro cultivators

454
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,119
the processors and the micro processors

455
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,039
because this is where Health Canada has

456
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,739
requirements on mandatory laboratory

457
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,509
batch testing for each batch of product

458
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,370
we see secondary business opportunities

459
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,650
in other areas of the ecosystem as well

460
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,509
- for example you could be a nursery

461
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,120
trying to breed a strain of cannabis

462
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,559
that's high in CVG we could support your

463
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,659
breeding program with our testing

464
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,179
services you could be a hemp cultivator

465
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,200
looking to determine how much CBD is in

466
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,820
your hemp crop that you've harvested

467
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,130
this year before you sell it on to a

468
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:24,649
processor in addition as good

469
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,450
manufacturing practices or GMP becomes

470
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,280
more entrenched in the Canadian cannabis

471
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,289
industry one requirement for our

472
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,670
customers will be processed validation

473
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:33,379
for in order to get their GMP

474
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,360
accreditation process validation

475
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,160
requires an element of testing to prove

476
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,689
your validation is on track as well to

477
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,190
you so we'll be able to support our

478
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,910
customers of the cheating GMP

479
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,529
accreditation as well - there are

480
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,269
already a handful of labs out there that

481
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:48,740
service the existing licensed producers

482
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:51,049
and I'm not here to say today that

483
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,730
anyone is doing any subpar Sciences or

484
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,548
any faulty testing in fact the major

485
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,950
challenge in the

486
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:57,778
industry today's capacity issues we her

487
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,819
stories have turnaround times in excess

488
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:01,798
of four weeks at some sites and some

489
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:03,269
labs actually advising quality managers

490
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,069
a tailpiece a day that they should start

491
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:07,019
looking for a second source lab testing

492
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:08,849
provider because they are anticipating

493
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,669
capacity issues as the cannabis act

494
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:13,798
passes we face some competition from our

495
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,749
customers well-funded LPS are able to

496
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,460
open their own internal laboratories to

497
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:19,288
conduct some of the testing the

498
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,058
exception is the pesticide testing which

499
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:22,589
under the cannabis Act will always have

500
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:25,618
to be mandatory third party with a

501
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:27,358
laboratory like us as micro cultivators

502
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,220
and micro processors enter the market

503
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:30,720
it's very unlikely that these customers

504
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,368
will invest in opening their own

505
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,019
internal laboratories because the

506
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:37,470
economics won't make sense for the scale

507
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:39,269
of their operations a little bit more

508
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,220
about how we plan to do business we will

509
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:42,868
be a cannabis first laboratory so in

510
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,700
other words our customers cannabis

511
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,519
samples will not compete with potatoes

512
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,319
for instrument time we will be investing

513
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,269
and focusing on developing a streamlined

514
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,798
digital customer experience for sample

515
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,778
submission and archival of your

516
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,608
certificates of analysis and touch bas

517
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:59,220
results we are conveniently located

518
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,019
adjacent to Pearson Airport which means

519
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,608
we can receive Next Day Delivery from

520
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,200
across the country allowing us to

521
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:06,538
service producers from coast to coast

522
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,399
with their batch testing will also be a

523
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:10,259
one-stop shop for all your testing needs

524
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:12,358
some labs focus just on the chemistry

525
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,950
just on the micro we will in fact do

526
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:17,009
both so you only need one provider to

527
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,359
achieve your batch testing a little on

528
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:20,278
the licensing note as I mentioned

529
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:22,648
earlier we filed an LD application in

530
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,179
May of 2018 this is the current

531
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:26,398
framework that Canada's testing labs

532
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,499
operate in industry today there will be

533
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:30,418
a new permit created under the cannabis

534
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:32,669
Act called an analytical permit all

535
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:34,859
existing cannabis testing labs will have

536
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:37,850
to reapply for this permit the go-live

537
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:40,230
data this permit is currently unknown

538
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:41,998
over a little short on time so for our

539
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,230
go-to-market plan the main takeaway is

540
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:44,940
that we intend on beginning our

541
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,419
commercial operations at the end of q3

542
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,129
beginning of q4 of this year here are

543
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,690
some of our sales forecast and potential

544
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:53,730
revenue that you're looking at so at

545
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,558
year 5 we would like to get between five

546
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,358
and six hundred samples per month of

547
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,739
both the full batch testing where our

548
00:22:57,358 --> 00:23:00,960
customer is coming to us for a full

549
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:02,608
panel of tasks and this day an equal

550
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,319
volume of the stand alone pesticide

551
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:06,118
pesticide test where a customer has her

552
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,789
own lab and is coming to us for just a

553
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,369
pesticide

554
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:11,559
first this volume by all means does

555
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:12,909
exist in the market today if you look at

556
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,409
some of the advertised production

557
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,720
capacities of the larger producers

558
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,540
thousands of kilograms per month and

559
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,039
divide that by a batch size of 50 to 100

560
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,049
kilograms you're seeing a positive

561
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,470
opportunity we've got a catch-all okay

562
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,450
sure

563
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,890
no worries thanks for the presentation

564
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,170
appreciate it

565
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,880
let's just sort of springboard it in to

566
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,800
where you were gonna go talk to us about

567
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,770
your sales forecasts I notice you're

568
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,930
projecting a pretty huge jump in

569
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:40,869
year-over-year growth from year 1 2018

570
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,820
year to 2019 why do you think you're

571
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:45,519
gonna see sort of a it looks like about

572
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:48,309
a 20-fold increase in revenues from year

573
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,720
1 year 2 so certainly as more customers

574
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,759
come into market there will be more

575
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,319
opportunity we will also be building out

576
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,000
our sales team as well as our

577
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:56,559
technicians and operating team in the

578
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,450
laboratory to process that additional

579
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,859
capacity as well - but in our plans at

580
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,370
the moment we have plans for a sales

581
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:04,509
force that will be driving their growth

582
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:06,069
that was a great presentation thank you

583
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:09,400
for packing a lot of information in

584
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:10,990
there one we're a few years in the

585
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,850
future and you have experienced this

586
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,779
exponential growth and you have juicy

587
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:16,480
profit margins

588
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:18,549
what would your company do to give back

589
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,440
what would your so your dream be around

590
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:22,299
a social responsibility venture of some

591
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,279
kind with the science sector in general

592
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:26,109
particularly with a chemistry aspect

593
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,970
there are lots of opportunities to green

594
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:31,209
the activities in that space a lot more

595
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,769
for example we can examine switching one

596
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,779
chemical with another is it what we

597
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,190
drink we will consume a lot of helium in

598
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,930
our operations for our gas phase

599
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,850
analysis this is a very unsustainable

600
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,860
resource that's harvested from the earth

601
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:44,109
and mining and once it's used it's gone

602
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:45,819
you can actually validate the use of

603
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,529
hydrogen instead for your gas phase

604
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,509
analysis but that takes time and effort

605
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:51,309
to run the two in parallel to show that

606
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:52,869
they're equivalent so if I had all the

607
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:54,669
unlimited time and resources that I

608
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:56,529
could I would love to invest more into

609
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,450
greening our efforts publishing those

610
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:00,129
publicly as application notes so that

611
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,690
other labs could use those as well -

612
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,980
because I don't see any benefit for us

613
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,019
to keep that internally for our own

614
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:10,788
operations

615
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:15,079
[Applause]

616
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:18,048
thanks a lot very useful sort of a you

617
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,359
talked about the fact that there is more

618
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:25,329
demand and supply at the moment and

619
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:27,769
eventually the supply will catch up I

620
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:29,509
have a question about your financial

621
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,240
projection because you're you're showing

622
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:35,029
an acceleration of sales despite the

623
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,099
fact that there is more supply and then

624
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:40,240
you're also showing I think I just

625
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:44,209
calculated quickly an increase in your

626
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,849
dollar per sales at the same time which

627
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,210
would imply that you're you know getting

628
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,949
more money out of every test so can you

629
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,350
help us understand how is the

630
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,150
commoditization going to impact your

631
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:59,449
business and how will you remain

632
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:02,298
relevant when there is more supply than

633
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,740
demand so I apologize if the numbers

634
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:05,359
presented anything to the contrary but

635
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,579
in our calculations we didn't account

636
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,109
for any kind of making more on each test

637
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:11,389
as we go but to answer your question

638
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:13,308
with regards to the commoditization in

639
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,288
the short term we will be able we will

640
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:16,548
benefit from the lack of capacity which

641
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:18,079
will give us an advantage but

642
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:19,819
longer-term that's not sustainable

643
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,369
what's really going to take over is

644
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:23,779
going to be the more custom type testing

645
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:25,219
services that we provide to our

646
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:27,589
customers to help them improve their

647
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,269
processes and make better products that

648
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:32,089
will allow us to guard and also keep

649
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:33,769
growing the base core routine testing

650
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:37,418
despite the fact that's becoming a

651
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:37,418
little bit more commoditized as well -

652
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:45,319
my question pertains more to sort of

653
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:46,759
personal use because i use the labs a

654
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:49,639
lot and they get they get really

655
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,460
expensive really quickly one thing I'd

656
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,730
like to ask labs a lot is do you have

657
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,610
like a group sort of rate instead of me

658
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:02,870
coming in sort of single source I want

659
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:04,639
like a rate for the months and I can

660
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:06,359
give you as many tests as I can jam and

661
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,910
for that month

662
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,469
and then have a single and have a single

663
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,210
price like there's a lot of labs out

664
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,460
there I know in the United States that

665
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:19,259
offer breeders and growers bulk discount

666
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,269
scenarios sure so given the volume

667
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:23,309
expectations and projections we could

668
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:25,230
we'd certainly expect to offer scale

669
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,579
discounts based on the volume I don't

670
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,650
know if we could agree that it would be

671
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,990
a thousand dollars for the month

672
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,519
regardless of 10 samples or 10,000 I

673
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,710
don't know if we could necessarily agree

674
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,450
to that but certainly as far as discount

675
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,980
scale goes that's something that we

676
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,870
would be able to offer as well too and

677
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,490
just to throw in there I noticed that

678
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,889
you didn't have terpenes on your list of

679
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,630
things yeah so terpenes is not a

680
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,920
mandatory batch test requirement

681
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,350
terpenes is something that we will

682
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,670
certainly be able to offer testing

683
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:52,049
services for with the equipment that

684
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,580
we're buying to provide those batch

685
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:54,779
testing services so I didn't have it

686
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,549
listed because Health Canada does not

687
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:04,309
require you to test returns on each

688
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:06,419
batch 30 seconds no pressure

689
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,889
thank you very much for your time was

690
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,279
very informative and in thank you very

691
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:13,620
much thank you everyone

692
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:16,019
fantastic next pitch will come from

693
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:18,239
cannabis arms or Kristalina it's a

694
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,750
cultivation monitoring software

695
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,980
it stands for analytics research

696
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,200
management system it's a purpose-built

697
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,940
intelligent light system which provides

698
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,460
cultivators with actionable information

699
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,130
to monitor their groves the company is

700
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,509
led by Chris Salina who brings a decade

701
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,120
of federal government experience

702
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:37,470
primarily with the Royal Canadian

703
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,019
Mounted Police and is partnered with

704
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,460
proxy Logica Corporation a professional

705
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,440
engineering team with two decades of

706
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,360
experience designing complex high-speed

707
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,130
circuit boards the company aims to get

708
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,319
their product to market later this year

709
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,620
or early next let's hear it for Chris

710
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,619
Alena

711
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:59,150
hello everybody hello dragons

712
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,330
how's it going I get to skip the first

713
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:05,750
part here that's brilliant

714
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:08,119
so the the Cannabis arms platform is an

715
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,359
intelligent complete solution to monitor

716
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:13,129
track light measure and improve licensed

717
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,099
cannabis grow operations in Canada and

718
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,500
around the world the overall project

719
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:20,480
budget finance wise is two million

720
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,130
dollars some of which has already been

721
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,809
raised for this strategic partnership

722
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,660
the funds will be used to field test

723
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:28,250
beta units and essentially fine-tune the

724
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,259
design of everything and make sure that

725
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,579
this is the best that we can make it and

726
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:36,410
we're looking at commercial production

727
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:39,559
by summer 2019 so over the next two

728
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:42,050
years the top 15 licensed publicly

729
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,119
traded producers are forecasting about a

730
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:47,690
tenfold increase in the square footage

731
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,429
of grow-op space so given that size

732
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,470
we're looking at a potential market of

733
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,000
about 800,000 sentinels which is a

734
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,579
device that I'll show you in a minute

735
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,440
here and the world is watching Canada

736
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:59,000
and of course as other countries start

737
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,320
to come into the fold with the same sort

738
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,019
of legislation we're gonna see that

739
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:07,789
market continue to increase the arms

740
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:09,769
project is a limited partnership right

741
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:11,569
now I represent the general partner and

742
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:14,150
as mentioned in my lovely introduction

743
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:16,490
I've worked for the RCMP for quite a

744
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:18,140
while my job was negotiating and

745
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,910
drafting agreements with municipalities

746
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,490
all the way up to federal government

747
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,930
agencies about a year ago I went to work

748
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,490
for a company called Wolf Paw data

749
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,289
centres they've been in business for two

750
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,970
decades and they have all of the usual

751
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,579
things that an internet service provider

752
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:33,460
has on offer business networking server

753
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:36,079
colocation a lot of that kind of stuff

754
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,930
in one of our projects we got together

755
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,059
with dr. David southwell and his team at

756
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:43,850
proxy logica to work on a disaster

757
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:45,289
recovery cloud they're experts in the

758
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,299
supercomputer industry they've been

759
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:49,609
working with companies like IBM and

760
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:51,289
hewlett-packard organizations like NASA

761
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:54,199
the US military and intelligence

762
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:57,559
communities and various international

763
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,660
research institutions as well so over

764
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,869
the last year they've been developing a

765
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,250
proprietary analytics technology

766
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:06,409
high-performance computing in areas like

767
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,509
genetics and smart cities

768
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:11,600
and anything that involves an enormous

769
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:14,119
enormous amount of data so with their

770
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,859
assistance ongoing we have licensed this

771
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,739
technology for the cannabis industry

772
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:20,689
worldwide we'll also be putting together

773
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,970
a technical advisory committee made up

774
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,160
of licensed growers regulators and

775
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,990
research institutions to give us

776
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:30,410
feedback and make sure that everything's

777
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:32,990
perfect so let's talk about what it

778
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,550
actually is analytics direct on the

779
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,440
floor information gathering from a

780
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,960
device that's hung just above the plant

781
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,640
it brings in information locally through

782
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,009
a variety of sensors computes that

783
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,120
information locally and sends the useful

784
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:49,430
data to a remote data center the

785
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:51,259
information is sent encrypted via an

786
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:53,539
auditable ledger both in flight and at

787
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:55,129
rest to ensure data integrity and then

788
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:59,109
it's analyzed there and sent back to the

789
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,110
operator in a much more useful fashion

790
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,920
the next piece is research what we're

791
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,019
looking to provide is an eye on the sky

792
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,690
over the entire facility trying to

793
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:09,980
eliminate human error will be working

794
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,670
with private laboratories and

795
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,809
universities to try and help them prove

796
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:20,840
effectively once and for all what are

797
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:22,579
optimal grow conditions the next thing

798
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,470
is management every facility could have

799
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:26,689
hundreds or even thousands of these

800
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,279
devices over their plants they'll have

801
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,960
common sensors like temperature and

802
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,180
humidity things that you're already

803
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,519
measuring but also uncommon ones a

804
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:37,039
multispectral camera which can detect

805
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,389
very specific wavelengths of light can

806
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,730
detect things like the chlorophyll

807
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,950
levels in a plant the health of the

808
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:46,430
plant pests in your facility and also

809
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:48,200
where they are in the facility it'll

810
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,690
also provide all of the light that the

811
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,840
plant needs to grow whether LED or

812
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,750
phosphorous or some other technology

813
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:58,189
depending on what the operator wants and

814
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,049
ultimately if your capex budgets already

815
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,950
spent I mean that is only one feature of

816
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:05,569
the device itself so this is my favorite

817
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,090
slide because I get to show you what it

818
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:09,980
looks like we call them sentinels it's a

819
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:12,529
central processing core with all of the

820
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,079
sensors and cameras mounted on it the

821
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:16,369
cameras provide live security video feed

822
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:18,169
and because you're dealing with a large

823
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,149
number of these this can help you comply

824
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,759
with Health Canada's every inch

825
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,200
your facility that needs to be covered

826
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,299
the device can track the position of

827
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,230
individual plants people and equipment

828
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:31,819
whether moving or stationary and as I

829
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,670
mentioned all of the information is sent

830
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:40,129
encrypted secure to a remote data center

831
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:42,170
for disaster recovery as well we've also

832
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,940
already begun discussions with the

833
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,370
industry part of the reason that we're

834
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,289
here of course as well as regulators and

835
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:52,309
researchers to start building out that

836
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:54,319
technical advisory committee at this

837
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:56,089
stage we're open to strategic investment

838
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,099
we're flexible on the type of entity or

839
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:59,629
finance instruments that are used the

840
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:01,639
bulk of the money that we receive will

841
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:04,670
be used to configure and refine and

842
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,170
perfect this device because at the end

843
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,850
of the day the hardware design has

844
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,148
already been designed it's it's been

845
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:13,009
completed our initial estimates we

846
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:14,898
expect to be able to replace lighting

847
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:20,030
tracking and security systems for just a

848
00:34:14,898 --> 00:34:23,179
fraction of today's cost our seed round

849
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:25,550
is oversubscribed by October we'll have

850
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:28,550
100 sentinels ready to roll out to our

851
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:31,220
strategic partners and at the moment

852
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,260
we're seeking 1.75 million dollars over

853
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:35,779
three tranches from October until May

854
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:41,270
with an official launch in summer of

855
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:43,130
2019 cannabis arms platform represents

856
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:46,039
the culmination of decades of data

857
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:48,590
management data movement analysis and

858
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,940
security experience it's been designed

859
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,510
in such a way that it can replace light

860
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:55,190
security and even staffing resources and

861
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,770
as all as an all-in-one intelligence

862
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,809
suite to try and drive efficiency across

863
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:02,269
the board for growth in the cannabis

864
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:06,320
industry and I throw myself at the mercy

865
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:08,389
of the judges well my question was also

866
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,130
gonna be around the environmental

867
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:11,719
impacts of this if there's a

868
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,160
multifunctional device is gonna replace

869
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:15,609
a lot of other gears so I wonder if

870
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:18,469
there's any other additional eco

871
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,809
footprint improvements you want to speak

872
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:22,399
to and then also I'm just wondering if

873
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:25,460
you're open to a comment that's not a

874
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,289
question Mike I think this device sounds

875
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:31,510
amazing it's not my area of expertise

876
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:33,090
and my comment is that the word arms and

877
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,700
Sentinel it

878
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,519
a bit of a military vibe and so while I

879
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:40,289
think that this device is like

880
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,509
potentially an incredible evolution of

881
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:44,400
the technology in our system maybe one

882
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,050
part of the processes we can like

883
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,440
rebrand it and make it a little more

884
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,670
loving and warm somehow we we could call

885
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,880
it if it looks a little like a flower

886
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,200
doesn't have a good brainstorm about it

887
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,599
maybe we come sweet at the after-party

888
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,919
later and have a jam I look forward to

889
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,139
it

890
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,139
yeah that sounds great as far as the the

891
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,969
eco impact when I was talking about it

892
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:07,379
being able to recognize pests in the

893
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,539
facility one of the things that happens

894
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,880
a lot right now is is blanket spraying

895
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:14,039
of the entire facility if you can nail

896
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,260
down this is the section of four or five

897
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,599
plants and we can we can get early

898
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,400
detection of those pests showing up then

899
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,860
you can spot treat rather than doing the

900
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,050
entire facility and I've I've heard of

901
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,670
situations where companies have had to

902
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,580
throw away an entire greenhouse worth of

903
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:33,389
product because it was a problem and if

904
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:35,730
you can catch it early it's great I have

905
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:36,929
two questions one might be it's quick

906
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,030
straightforward question you mentioned

907
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,949
earlier it's built for purpose-built for

908
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,810
indoor application are you including

909
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:45,559
greenhouse in the category of indoor

910
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:47,670
application yes okay

911
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:50,400
cannabis is obviously not the first

912
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,769
plant that's been grown at scale in

913
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,720
greenhouses for human consumption that's

914
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:57,469
a pretty highly developed food industry

915
00:36:54,719 --> 00:37:00,509
out there and I have to imagine that

916
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:03,209
food producers for example have in

917
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,160
existence technology that is sampling

918
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,840
the environment sampling the temperature

919
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:10,230
sampling the moles hittin the plant

920
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,240
doing the kind of things that the soon

921
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,960
to be renamed sentinel is going to be

922
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:18,959
doing how are you going to penetrate

923
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:24,630
what i think is probably a very well

924
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:27,119
developed market for greenhouse plant

925
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,849
reporting technology in our research

926
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,480
it's not nearly as well developed as one

927
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,699
would think

928
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,159
and our suspicion is is because the crop

929
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:38,369
is very low value on an individual plant

930
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:40,559
basis you know LED is something that is

931
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,659
taking off but hasn't really replaced

932
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,460
everything which is you know evidenced

933
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:46,480
by a lot of the greenhouses in in

934
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,170
cannabis still using the old

935
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,519
high-pressure sodium so we haven't been

936
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,769
able to find anything that really

937
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:58,900
consolidates all of these pieces into a

938
00:37:53,769 --> 00:38:01,420
single focal point preper comes to mind

939
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:05,590
for me it's a greenhouse monitoring

940
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:07,030
system that anyways I'm gonna break off

941
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,190
of a few questions

942
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,640
how big is how big is this four foot by

943
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,840
four foot area so is it so does it like

944
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:16,929
sticks to the roof that's what those

945
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,090
sort of arms do yep they're those those

946
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:21,099
arms are removable so they're at in this

947
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,210
particular design they're LED so they

948
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,789
can be removed to change though

949
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,929
different kinds of lights or things

950
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:27,699
along those lines what's the square

951
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:30,039
footage coverage of each unit like how

952
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:31,899
many would you need for 4 foot by 4 foot

953
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:34,000
for each one for every 4 foot by 4 foot

954
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,860
you would need another one yep now at

955
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,269
the moment as I say the the physical

956
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:42,550
design is something that we're looking

957
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:44,199
for feedback on right because get into

958
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,390
one a canopies greenhouses it's a

959
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,189
million square feet yep

960
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:50,769
what's the cost of one of these units I

961
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,240
don't have an exact cost but we're well

962
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,610
under a thousand dollars magnify have

963
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,139
you built one do you have a prototype we

964
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,120
have prototypes that we've that we've

965
00:38:56,139 --> 00:39:00,009
constructed or a prototype design but

966
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:01,509
one that looks like this at this

967
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,190
particular design not yet don't have

968
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:09,880
yeah so that's October we'll have a

969
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:11,769
hundred of them built gotta have the

970
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,000
dragons in there we got 11 second 12

971
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:16,150
second no no that's over

972
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,800
that's over we're trouble now so so tell

973
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,960
me a little bit more than about how it

974
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,120
can detect bugs on on a plant like if

975
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,920
you do it's a spider my second spider my

976
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,389
twenty twenty seconds okay so pine

977
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,130
beetles in BC they use a two hundred

978
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:28,750
thousand dollar camera on a plane and

979
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,579
they fly it over the over the forest

980
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,500
when you're only a few feet away from

981
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:35,590
the plant you don't need a two hundred

982
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,090
thousand dollar camera so essentially it

983
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,590
does the same kind of thing where you're

984
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,660
looking for a particular light signature

985
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,890
but because you're so much closer you

986
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:43,629
can do it with a much less expensive

987
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:45,579
product so it's like an infrared or

988
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,950
something you'd have to talk to the

989
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:50,369
engineer about that sure okay all right

990
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:50,369
let's hear

991
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:58,059
here we go it's the stache kin of group

992
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,769
Jorah Frazier grower and branding

993
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:01,599

craft cannabis on the store shelves come

1107
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,868
fall of next year

1108
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:29,358
most of our corporate energy has been

1109
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:32,338
into the retail to brand development and

1110
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,960
we'd like to continue the work and

1111
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:37,048
development we've been doing in that

1112
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,869
regard and so we're looking to enter in

1113
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:43,018
and open up some shops in the summer

1114
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:44,369
next year and I'd like to do a quick

1115
00:44:43,018 --> 00:44:45,719
shout out to the audience here if anyone

1116
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,220
wants to learn a bit more about what we

1117
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:48,959
have going on what our plans are for the

1118
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:51,149
future or just to meet us on a personal

1119
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,019
level we'll be in the room next door

1120
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:56,519
after their presentation and yeah I just

1121
00:44:55,018 --> 00:44:58,459
want to thank you all for spending such

1122
00:44:56,518 --> 00:45:02,038
a beautiful little afternoon with us

1123
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:05,720
panel but that's our presentation thanks

1124
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:05,720
a bunch will toss mic over these guys

1125
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:13,259
between if you could tell me an

1126
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:14,940
impactful story of of someone that

1127
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:17,608
you've helped in the medical marijuana

1128
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:20,190
industry that would be my mom she has

1129
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:22,018
Parkinson's she doesn't use cannabis she

1130
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,909
never did as a as a personal consumer

1131
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:25,318
and she uses it mostly for the

1132
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:27,358
medication that she takes to helps with

1133
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:29,338
the side effects so I think not only is

1134
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,588
it useful for medical benefits directly

1135
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:33,748
but it also helps offset and can reduce

1136
00:45:31,588 --> 00:45:37,170
the effects of a lot of other harsh

1137
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:39,389
pharmaceuticals out there thank you for

1138
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,039
the great presentation and I know that

1139
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:42,778
you guys work with a couple of my

1140
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,249
favorite extractors on the Gulf Islands

1141
00:45:42,778 --> 00:45:46,018
and you also live in one of the gulf

1142
00:45:44,248 --> 00:45:48,929
islands which is very like close to home

1143
00:45:46,018 --> 00:45:50,368
for me but I want to ask a little bit

1144
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:52,768
about your staffing so you have a pretty

1145
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:56,220
big team of staff and I imagine that

1146
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:58,229
with the retail locations you want to

1147
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:59,939
open up you're gonna have quite a big

1148
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,920
team so I'm wondering if you can talk a

1149
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,710
little bit more about your hiring

1150
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,389
practices and the kind of how the

1151
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,548
diversity of your team and how important

1152
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:10,518
it is to you around hiring diverse

1153
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:14,400
people to work in your company

1154
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:16,048
thank you yeah I think that the cannabis

1155
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,809
company of the future is really gonna

1156
00:46:16,048 --> 00:46:22,199
have to be into disciplinary and diverse

1157
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:23,430

cannabis which brings people together

1159

workplace we've got people from Turkey

1171

1172

culture in the world all the different

1173
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:07,710

to have fun a thanks a lot

1177
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:23,400
very exciting business idea can you just

1178
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:26,069
explain a little bit your current

1179
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,610
business what do you do and how does the

1180
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:31,650
cultivation and retail tie-in with the

1181
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:37,680
current business and not so clear on how

1182
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:39,869
the big art works no we're no we're like

1183
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,159
a vertically integrated group similar to

1184
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:46,650
some of the people that spoke earlier

1185
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:48,629
today production value-added products

1186
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,460
building brands and also recreational

1187
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,720
brands that engage with consumers we're

1188
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,400
a small company but we're super

1189
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:54,539
dedicated and passionate and think we

1190
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,800
have a really good knowledge base to be

1191
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:58,199
successful in the future but we're

1192
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,030
taking a holistic approach vertically

1193
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,939
integrating ourselves a lot of our work

1194
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:05,670
is done online because Canadians about

1195
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:08,519
90 percent of all retail purchases

1196
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,680
whether done in person or online start

1197
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:12,960
online and so we've done a lot of work

1198
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,089
focusing on developing some online real

1199
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,260
estate that we think is going to be

1200
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:22,050
valuable in the future so you've asked

1201
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,570
for the funds to do two things one is

1202
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:27,450
micro cultivation and you've suggested

1203
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:29,490
you need 360,000 Canadian on that end

1204
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:32,279
and the others development of the retail

1205
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:36,089
brand which I understand to be opening

1206
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:38,550
retail stores is that correct yes the

1207
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:40,590
bulk of the spend is in the application

1208
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:43,769
for the licenses in locking

1209
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:45,000
down locations and and how many of this

1210
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:46,590
for the sport at five hundred

1211
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,260
seventy-six thousand dollars who's

1212
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,420
seeking on the retail side how many

1213
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,030
stores do you think you can get open for

1214
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,740
that amount of money depends on the

1215
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,650
market whether we're talking like small

1216
00:48:55,739 --> 00:49:00,419
town you know our city or so it really

1217
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,490
depends you know we've had to be pretty

1218
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:06,090
flexible we've kind of been the way of

1219
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:09,000
the wrap up us which is a rabbit octopus

1220
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:10,860
combination and so we're have been you

1221
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,500
know collecting you know low-hanging

1222
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:15,120
fruit as it becomes available and trying

1223
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,710
to do what we can it also depends where

1224
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,059
the licensing we put in applications for

1225
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,559
Saskatchewan but we didn't win the

1226
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,420
lottery there so it kind of depends on

1227
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,250
which region which municipality it's

1228
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,320
gonna change the cost when you're

1229
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:27,449
actively engaged in seeking retail

1230
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,490
spaces and making the applications were

1231
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:31,649
available it's going out definitely yeah

1232
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:33,989
we have all the SOPs and everything done

1233
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,190
