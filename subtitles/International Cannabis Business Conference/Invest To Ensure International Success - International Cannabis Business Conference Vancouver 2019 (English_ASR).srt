1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,269
Beasley everybody no podium in a hard

2
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,359
act to follow I have a couple slides

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,679
this is gonna be a fun one here main

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,538
thing like since we're in Canada I'm

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,489
gonna try not to offend Canada even

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,269
though there's a lot of examples of what

7
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,768
not to do here just like Colorado which

8
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:27,299
is gonna be very very important and I

9
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,479
know lunch is coming so I'll try to do a

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,099
high-level keep things brief and good so

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,509
when you think about a Canadian company

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,849
how are you gonna be relevant in this

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,439
big change and what's your play

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,200
internationally that's really what we

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,359
help to do just to kind of start as a

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,379
disclaimer I'm not a lawyer I'm not a

17
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,750
CPA you must use these professionals in

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:50,488
everything you do and as you're growing

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,799
this industry this is going to be a

20
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,359
normal business and if you don't set up

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,339
yourself to be a normal business you

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,488
will be crushed as litigation is

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,500
skyrocketing just a quick background on

24
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,018
myself I started in the cannabis

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,868
industry in Colorado 2006 after the

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,310
military I've seen the entire cannabis

27
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,319
industry emerge from the first

28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,090
commercial sales in Colorado which we

29
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,908
kind of helped to start with medical and

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,609
on the first adult use market scaled and

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,020
have worked in 34 states worked in 16

32
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,519
countries already so we have a pretty

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,560
good idea of what's going on in the

34
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,359
world and specifically we're not

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,740
guessing when it comes to some of these

36
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,959
countries and policies that we're gonna

37
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,209
go over but I started I'm a farm kid

38
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,009
from Wisconsin really deep focus on

39
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,169
agriculture which is what we started in

40
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,359
but now having worked in all sectors of

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,250
the industry a lot of the truths that

42
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,379
will share about Canada are very very

43
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,420
similar to other markets but the thing

44
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,699
you have to remember is that US cannabis

45
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,920
and Canadian cannabis it doesn't

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,420
translate to international cannabis and

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,189
you can't just think you're gonna launch

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,379
some gummy bear brand here and then be

49
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,989
selling in Germany next year which is

50
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,640
pretty pretty important so when we think

51
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,709
about the world and what happened from

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,500
California Compassionate Care Act in

53
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:04,169
1996 how that's scaled and what's

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,879
happened it's pretty [ __ ] incredible

55
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,610
to think that we actually have a

56
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,068
bonafide industry today that's not only

57
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,650
disrupting but interrupting normal

58
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,060
business processes

59
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,039
and as you're looking at the rest of the

60
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,680
world a lot of like that black area

61
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,810
still it's only a matter of time and

62
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,150
it's not going to be Finland producing

63
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,549
in for Finland it's not going to be this

64
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,099
continual rollout model where can you

65
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:30,530
produce lower cost at the same standards

66
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:32,750
to achieve like a global domination and

67
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,340
that's what the big players that haven't

68
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,739
gotten into this space yet are really

69
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,090
looking at us this scales so today we're

70
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,769
going to cover some on the global side

71
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,049
some on the US side and some on the

72
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,730
Canada side and really think of how it

73
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:46,099
all comes together and the key

74
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:47,539
difference here like I have a consulting

75
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:49,250
company we have venture capital

76
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:52,310
companies now do private equity

77
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,739
international the really similarity here

78
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,900
in everything is capital without it

79
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:58,939
you're screwed and how to actually get

80
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,459
institutional capital or private

81
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:04,000
investors is challenging everyone went

82
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,199
public here in Canada good for a few

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,969
hasn't worked out for a lot of them and

84
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,318
based on a few of the things that we'll

85
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:11,419
talk about it's not going to work for

86
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,939
many of them so private capital as

87
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:17,659
you're scaling is so so critical to

88
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:20,239
focus on a big thing about international

89
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:22,759
like I said it's not the same as the US

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,549
or Canada in Canada and Uruguay very

91
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:28,399
ballsy in legalizing a narcotic for

92
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:30,200
adult use purposes and God bless Canada

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,319
for having the first mover advantage in

94
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,780
this but Health Canada had no idea how

95
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,388
to go from medical to recreational and

96
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,939
it's been one of the biggest

97
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:42,169
catastrophes I'd say in our industry

98
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:44,209
since the inception like bigger than

99
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,609
vape things bigger than like children

100
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,019
getting products or wrongful deaths so

101
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,730
when you're going international you have

102
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,650
to know the rules to play this game an

103
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,899
international policy when it comes to

104
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,060
the single convention how the UN is

105
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,430
looking at this how that you like whe o

106
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,169
is looking at this if you don't know

107
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,329
those rules and you're planning global

108
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,669
partnerships it's not just about some

109
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:07,579
country in Zimbabwe or Swaziland or

110
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:09,889
Uganda or some Giorgio RAC play that's

111
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,359
gonna be a big big deal they have to be

112
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,919
compliant with these drug policies

113
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:17,449
because if not they just won't happen

114
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,478
GMP is a big thing everyone talks about

115
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,978
it thinks it's so so easy and Health

116
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,569
Canada there were five maybe six

117
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,810
companies that are now getting GMP

118
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:27,149
compliance

119
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,310
but it's not just about doing GMP to

120
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:30,989
sell to Europe you're trying to make

121
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,910
sure that you don't have risks and

122
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,668
liabilities as your business scales and

123
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,050
GMP is just one of these the really

124
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:40,259
important one if you're in cultivation

125
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,418
GA CP everyone thinks GA P is so

126
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,430
important but it's actually GA CP good

127
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,168
agricultural collection practices that

128
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,550
most of these businesses are founded on

129
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:52,560
but if you're doing anything

130
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:55,139
international GA P G ACP GMP GDP and GL

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,490
p for laboratories critical because

132
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,519
that's the big challenge here that

133
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,829
you're gonna see in Canada when we think

134
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,319
about the US quick which many Canadian

135
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:05,250
companies are coming down to launch into

136
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,110
Canada because they're highly

137
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,720
capitalized from their public markets

138
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,050
you think in the United States there are

139
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,660
47 of 50 states that have some sort of

140
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,329
medical cannabis law we've got 11 states

141
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,070
that have adult use 31 that have some

142
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:22,680
sort of commercial sales for medical

143
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,839
that's over half and like the previous

144
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,030
gentleman said like once there's 25 rec

145
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,699
states it's only a matter of time but

146
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:31,409
you have to know in the United States

147
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:33,629
medical legalization will happen first

148
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,919
and just because everyone thinks Trump's

149
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:37,829
gonna legalize it to try to get

150
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,019
reelected even if he tried there are

151
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:42,209
many steps and policies that would have

152
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,038
to happen before that would happen so

153
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,620
focus on medical legalization in the

154
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,750
u.s. first followed by an adult use and

155
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,079
it's not a question of if this is going

156
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,939
to happen it's when but in the United

157
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,219
States with Colorado right where we were

158
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,589
and started to now think of all of those

159
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,720
blue states that adult use is happening

160
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,609
and yeah Michigan is slow Illinois is

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,610
about to happen Maine and Massachusetts

162
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,288
kind of messed up programs initially but

163
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,000
over ninety two percent of all of the

164
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:12,478
revenue in the United States reported

165
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,310
today is from the adult use side and I'm

166
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,019
a disabled vet that's how I got into the

167
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,990
cannabis industry and we have to

168
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:21,959
remember the medical side from taxes and

169
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,030
quality but here even in Canada the

170
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,159
medical industry who's talking about it

171
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,899
who cares about it anymore and the

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,970
medical is the foot into the door into

173
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,679
the adult use market we've seen it in

174
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,240
the United States a hundred percent of

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,280
the time if you were medical licensed

176
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,500
you have some sort of first preference

177
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,009
to get to adult use sounds similar to

178
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,009
Canada

179
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,508
so big opportunities in the United

180
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,759
States now it's not a closed market but

181
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,439
it's state-by-state and until interstate

182
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
commerce is allowed from federal

183
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,509
legalization I can't produce an Oregon

184
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,339
and then ship it to another state so you

185
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,468
have to have new companies in each state

186
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,179
new business partners sometimes there's

187
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:03,240
residency requirements you look at

188
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,639
Arkansas v cultivation processing

189
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,590
licenses for 3 million people if that

190
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,199
was Colorado equivalent you'd have 10

191
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:13,198
growers for Colorado the growers that's

192
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,718
about 1.4 billion of the addressable

193
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,848
revenue so when there's a limited market

194
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:20,339
and you can get into it you have to get

195
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:22,500
into it first but the big ones right now

196
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,198
in the United States Illinois when you

197
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,348
think about that map first adult use in

198
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,669
the Midwest and Michigan was a very we

199
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,378
call it like one of the dirty seven

200
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:32,788
states it had a medical program you can

201
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,250
have the cards on the wall and like not

202
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:36,718
sell it but then of course like four

203
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,699
billion dollars of cannabis were

204
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:41,069
flooding out of Michigan every year to

205
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,620
the to the East Coast same thing in

206
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,330
Maine so you think Illinois adult use is

207
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,949
going to be huge major Canadian

208
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:49,288
companies are applying there it's gonna

209
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,210
be very very challenging but twelve

210
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:53,009
million people adult use social

211
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,138
consumption lounges near the borders

212
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,580
it's going to be phenomenal and you also

213
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,978
have to think about the neighboring

214
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:00,028
countries or states like here in Canada

215
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,859
you've got ninety percent of your

216
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:04,259
population within 10 miles of the US

217
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,020
border and then 90 percent of all

218
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,110
Canadians live in three territories that

219
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:12,870
have shitty shitty laws when you're like

220
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,060
Quebec Montreal Ontario and great

221
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,978
British Columbia you've missed out on

222
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,500
five six billion dollars in revenue just

223
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,699
from not doing it correctly so you're

224
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,829
thinking about these new states as

225
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:26,098
they're coming up California for example

226
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:28,500
nearly 70% of all municipalities have no

227
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,538
cannabis laws yet some allow medical

228
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,158
production some allow maybe just medical

229
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:34,319
sales the same thing that's going to

230
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,939
happen here in Canada so you have to

231
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,339
target the municipalities get those

232
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,050
licenses and be compliant with the

233
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,630
municipalities being compliant with

234
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,120
Health Canada laws but the United States

235
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:47,309
is not over it's just begun and it's not

236
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,600
just these few big MSO multi-state

237
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:51,539
operators that are going to take the

238
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,290
whole pie but getting in into a new

239
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,689
state

240
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,769
vital in the beginning it's so much you

241
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,839
think Florida

242
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,179
you want to buy part of a license for 86

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,130
million dollars today that license we

244
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,588
helped to get like four years ago they

245
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:06,360
spent less than a million to get it so

246
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,790
just these pieces of paper have major

247
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,009
major value but the United States you'll

248
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,198
notice a lot of Canadian focus coming

249
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,778
down trying to get it and capitalized

250
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:17,039
but there's one problem here investing

251
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:19,919
into something that's federally illegal

252
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,809
as a foreign national not the best idea

253
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,599
especially when you have boards of

254
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:26,129
directors and optics and image I have no

255
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,470
problem very confederal law in the

256
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:31,350
United States as long as I'm following

257
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,300
state or territory law Canada by

258
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,060
legalizing recreational cannabis

259
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,649
violated international law same with

260
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,888
Uruguay and this could cause some major

261
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:43,198
challenges which we'll get into so let's

262
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,120
get into Canada here kind of been a fun

263
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:46,708
market to watch I really appreciated

264
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
your medical market initially and what

265
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:53,219
that did but then with the public

266
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:56,338
infusion of capital 2014-2015 it caused

267
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,379
let's just call it chaos in Canada and

268
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:01,380
the rest of the world where I remember

269
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:05,250
speaking in San Francisco for ICBC about

270
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:07,318
a year ago if you put a million dollars

271
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,409
into the top Canadian public LPS you'd

272
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:12,509
have 4.1 million dollars today an Aurora

273
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,278
stock down four or five percent and with

274
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,778
the news coming out today it'll probably

275
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,509
be seven eight percent by the end of the

276
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:20,039
day they all got huge but none of them

277
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,778
remembered that you have to make revenue

278
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,818
eventually and you have to meet these

279
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:25,679
projections and yes taking over the

280
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:28,049
world this a giant public company sounds

281
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,359
great but everyone wants you every

282
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:32,519
single day and if you're trying to do

283
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,259
this how your redeploying capital in

284
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,149
buying other companies if you're a

285
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,129
canadian public company and in the

286
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,198
united states I mean Laurie Ajax was

287
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,809
here earlier today I mean there's some

288
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:44,490
major potential implications of being a

289
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,318
foreign national company and investing

290
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,970
into something federally illegal the

291
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:50,490
United States we love to protect our

292
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,810
businesses and our IP what would happen

293
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,730
then as we get closer to federal

294
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:55,768
legalization we want to kick out some of

295
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,539
these companies you have to have some

296
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,310
divesting strategies as well if you're

297
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,269
gonna get into the United States and how

298
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,549
you're going to structure those

299
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:04,649
companies

300
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:06,509
some major things with the cultivation

301
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,789
area which is expanded that's an actual

302
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,559
photo on the left there of cannabis that

303
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:12,149
was purchased recently here in Canada

304
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,699
quality is something that people don't

305
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,039
understand once you're an LP if you've

306
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,850
bought rec cannabis here it's pretty

307
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,250
pathetic

308
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,889
it's like Colorado in like 2010 and

309
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,259
there are some good companies that are

310
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:27,029
doing this but the packaging and the

311
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:28,620
quality and everyone keeps talking about

312
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,159
all these shortages which we're going to

313
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,330
get into but they don't realize that

314
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,639
quality is something that's paramount

315
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,170
and when you think internationally

316
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,449
quality is a different term it's not

317
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:42,120
like this is dank bud bro that's

318
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,860
consumer quality but the GMP the quality

319
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,529
standards by Canada you have to hit that

320
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,180
but you have to also remember consumer

321
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,339
quality it's the same problem that

322
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:53,219
better can has like world leader in

323
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,080
cannabis exports nineteen countries six

324
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,550
varieties that are shipped into Germany

325
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,740
and based on the price and the quality

326
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,719
most people don't like it but it's some

327
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,899
of the most standard deviation like the

328
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,360
lowest in the world like for consistent

329
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,100
supply but it's garbage and no one likes

330
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,440
to smoke it or the DRI kind of horrible

331
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,269
cannabis here you have to start going

332
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,180
towards quality and not selling popcorn

333
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,769
nugs it's just it's not how you launch a

334
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,979
quality brand and when we think about

335
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,710
brands it's very very hard to brand like

336
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,110
a Johnny Apple but when you're an apple

337
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,670
sauce company or Heinz ketchup that's

338
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,669
different than growing the dankest or

339
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:31,679
heirloom tomatoes and as a farmer I love

340
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:34,589
the quality side but the consumer

341
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,909
packaged goods and brands five six years

342
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,800
ago we just made fun of them because

343
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:39,719
nothing was quality and they kept

344
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,279
growing more and more the quality is

345
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,029
going to be the key differentiator

346
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,720
in these markets as they expand this

347
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:51,120
this is pretty hilarious here in Canada

348
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,830
there's almost 700 pending LPS right now

349
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
because your licensing process kind of

350
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,070
sucked you got your first license had to

351
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,570
build out your whole expensive facility

352
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,390
have your inspections and then have a

353
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,000
license with almost 700 in the queue and

354
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:05,399
this much supply that's just sitting

355
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,649
around it's not that there's a shortage

356
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,480
of supply they're saying this so that

357
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,279
investment dollars continue to flow into

358
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,470
these LPS to build-out cultivation

359
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,189
centers but I'm from northern Wisconsin

360
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,769
as a kid

361
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,610
there's a sink called winter Canada is

362
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:23,740
not the best place to grow cannabis even

363
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,589
with greenhouses even in an old

364
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,360
Hershey's chocolate factory your cost of

365
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,029
production are high your taxes are

366
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,610
horrible and it's very very hard to

367
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:34,809
structure correctly in Canada so when

368
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,399
you're thinking about the average cost

369
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,679
of production and what's price the

370
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,809
prices are happening at building more

371
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,578
and more cultivation centers in Canada

372
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:44,679
is not the option and if you're a craft

373
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:46,359
grower which god bless you and I love

374
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,059
that side if you don't have distribution

375
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,100
to get into the sales channels you don't

376
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:53,528
have a shot we've seen the same thing in

377
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,970
the United States and in Colorado we

378
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,620
started to put in door out of business

379
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,199
with big greenhouses back two thousand

380
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,639
nine ten and eleven greenhouse is a very

381
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,859
good thing but then Aurora with their

382
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,589
massive facility it's a hundred and ten

383
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,730
million Canadian to build that thing we

384
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:08,290
could have built that with like Turkish

385
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,750
company some Dutch companies for about

386
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:12,578
twenty five so this is not the place

387
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,198
where international exports are going to

388
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:16,088
happen even though you were the first to

389
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,250
be able to do it but there is plenty of

390
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,660
cannabis here and then allowing outdoor

391
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,429
production for oils as you're getting

392
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,919
into your extracted products in the

393
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:25,299
future that's gonna be a key key part

394
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,599
that's gonna put a lot of these indoor

395
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:29,919
facilities out of business when you're

396
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,509
thinking about wholesale price like

397
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,519
benchmarks does a great job in the

398
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:36,250
United States this is the average then

399
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,220
for all track sales in Canada at this

400
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,470
point when you're thinking about better

401
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,870
can like I mentioned they can only sell

402
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,120
for 2.5 euros a gram to the office of

403
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,610
medical cannabis like in the Netherlands

404
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,560
they then sell that you know to the bee

405
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,539
farm bee farm to an importer importers

406
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,059
to a distributor distributor to a

407
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:57,338
pharmacy that's why in Germany you'll

408
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:00,099
see cannabis from 18 to 25 euros a gram

409
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:03,309
that the grower only got 2.5 a gram for

410
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,430
that they're growing it for maybe at 125

411
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:08,708
to 140 a gram if your margins that

412
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:10,568
you're nothing that big sale that they

413
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,429
did to London the first one of like 400

414
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:15,039
grams they made less than a thousand

415
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:16,269
euros from doing that sale and the same

416
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,159
things gonna happen to Canadian

417
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,110
companies so all the people building

418
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,818
these facilities out thinking just

419
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,159
because you got first mover advantage to

420
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:25,870
ship to the world it's all about price

421
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,549
if you meet the quality standard and

422
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,320
you're the lowest price you get the

423
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:30,299
generic

424
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,080
tract for the country and it's not going

425
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:35,849
to be the Canadians for much much longer

426
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,520
this is huge for what's gonna happen to

427
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,490
you flower and a few types of topicals

428
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:46,769
and basic oils was not the way to launch

429
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:48,539
cannabis in Canada and 2007 and December

430
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,159
was the first time for all track sales

431
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:52,500
in the United States we saw that it

432
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,480
wasn't flower anymore and I love a good

433
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,690
joint but when you can just hit a vape

434
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,550
pen or like eat an edible it's very very

435
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,310
different and gets a lot more consumers

436
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:03,629
so this is gonna explode in Canada with

437
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,449
all the vaping issues that have happened

438
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,159
in the United States it's not the

439
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,500
cannabis that's dangerous here it's

440
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,209
thing we had no regulations for this and

441
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,279
then you're seeing the same thing with

442
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,080
tobacco so the companies that launched

443
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,839
that aren't using vitamin E or

444
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,780
polypropylene Ollis their solvents or

445
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,899
their viscous agents not reintroducing

446
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,730
terpenes or fake flavors those companies

447
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,590
are gonna scale and do phenomenal here

448
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,200
and it's gonna change the face of the

449
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,639
Canadian cannabis industry now in

450
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,410
October when those start to come out in

451
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,569
sales like December through February and

452
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,949
these brands launch it's gonna change

453
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,660
because your flower quality has been

454
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,240
crap your packaging has been pretty

455
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,769
crappy there's not been many stores when

456
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,230
you think in Montreal for a while that

457
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:48,240
one store for that whole place or here

458
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,870
in BC like there's so few same thing in

459
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,120
Mont Ontario as new products come out

460
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,759
and consumer packaged goods brands with

461
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,610
distribution will change this landscape

462
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,049
and I easily foresee that probably 60 70

463
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,120
percent of your market within a year and

464
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:05,759
a half to two years will be infused

465
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,490
extracted products but your packaging

466
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,338
you know has a couple issues too to be

467
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,199
seen here so some major opportunities

468
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,569
for Canada even though I'm saying some

469
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,820
of the challenges for it there's gonna

470
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,338
be more and more consolidations you're

471
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,809
gonna see major ancillary plays for like

472
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,970
ancillary products and ancillary

473
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:26,039
services since this is the first

474
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,680
legalized real country no offense

475
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,500
Uruguay you have this opportunity that

476
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,779
what works here for a country will then

477
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,640
scale to the United States and like our

478
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,649
point-of-sale systems our packaging

479
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,720
companies our distribution companies are

480
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,970
going to mirror and a lot of Canadian

481
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,950
companies will come down

482
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,169
take that market share so if you're in

483
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,580
the ancillary sign for cannabis you're

484
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:49,070
in a good place it's also a way less

485
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:51,649
risky you can do banking it's not

486
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,658
cannabis and that's something that for

487
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,309
the US has major major value it's not

488
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:57,440
your quality of how good you grow we'd

489
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,750
like not saying that they don't do that

490
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,150
well in Canada you of course do but not

491
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,849
making it to the stores and you've got

492
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,759
here British Columbia the California of

493
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:09,949
Canada grows copious amounts of cannabis

494
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,970
that's not text like taxed and regulated

495
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,159
so highly

496
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,690
so as this starts to change and more and

497
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,850
more testing is coming out and these big

498
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,190
producers start making quality that's

499
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:21,709
where I see some key pivotal plays but

500
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,110
also your distribution if you don't have

501
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,730
distribution which a lot of the big LPS

502
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,558
and pub codes have tried to tie up your

503
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,919
products don't make it to market

504
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:32,690
same thing in California in California

505
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,520
if you're not paying for shelf space as

506
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,500
a brand or have a really good

507
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,629
distribution company your craft cannabis

508
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,038
or your products don't make the shelves

509
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,530
and then you'll see companies like

510
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,529
canned Essen not giving a plug out here

511
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:46,759
for colors in a pretty logo small

512
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,829
cultivation center but with a

513
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,869
distribution license that buys wholesale

514
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:52,939
repackages under their brands pay for

515
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:54,829
shelf space and flood that product

516
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,360
around the market and the same thing

517
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:58,399
that's gonna happen here in Canada just

518
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,979
like many of the big Opie's they buy

519
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,140
from other small producers repackage it

520
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,970
and then get that to the stores and as

521
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,350
your brands start to establish that's

522
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,269
something most people haven't been able

523
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,178
to consider you've got Edison and Cova

524
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:12,798
and a few but it gets larger brands will

525
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,059
dictate the future and a lot of them

526
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,529
will be regional and territorial based

527
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:20,359
exports were huge for Canada because you

528
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:22,668
used to just have bedrock in in the

529
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,288
Netherlands five or six of those bigger

530
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:26,090
producers starting to do their press

531
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,279
releases about exports but it's still

532
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,058
not been that high because

533
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,609
internationally without doctoral

534
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:33,798
education there are no patients and

535
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:35,629
without patients there's no clients and

536
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,639
then no clients there's no revenue and

537
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,130
then there's no business that's been the

538
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,580
problem with Aurora and canopy and like

539
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,710
tilray

540
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,449
getting all these licenses all over the

541
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,669
world which we've got licenses in

542
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,350
thirteen countries right now but a lot

543
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:50,600
of them you have to hold it and it's a

544
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:52,579
longer term international play and

545
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,929
you're producing that for like medical

546
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,730
pharmaceutical cannabis

547
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,310
versus we're gonna have rekt cannabis in

548
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,170
Germany anytime soon but the export side

549
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,579
is what caused a lot of their value to

550
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,440
go huge through the roof but they were

551
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:05,470
thinking the rest of the world was going

552
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,500
to be like the United States and Canada

553
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:11,150
International we export flour and oil

554
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,910
compounding happens in pharmacies it's

555
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,890
not vape pens it's not suppositories to

556
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,759
get into that side you're talking 7 to

557
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,160
11 years

558
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,259
of preclinical clinical three phases of

559
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,970
development but that's like the

560
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,529
international play that's really really

561
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,690
valuable that most people aren't seeing

562
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:29,119
it's not just about shipping dry flour

563
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,920
around the world but like our license in

564
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,069
Portugal we could produce for about 13

565
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,750
euro cents a gram a tenth of what it

566
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,230
costs in the Netherlands and compared to

567
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,960
Canada

568
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,059
I mean maybe an eighth or I'm sorry like

569
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,860
a twelfth as much as Canada and we're

570
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,269
already in Europe that's why when we

571
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:46,009
talk about Columbian some of these other

572
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,930
countries there's major opportunities

573
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:50,089
but you have to use what you did in

574
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,890
Canada to scale to the world and not

575
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:53,119
just entrench yourself thinking this is

576
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,810
where you're gonna produce for the rest

577
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,639
of the all time your medical market

578
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:01,069
cannot be forgotten about patients or

579
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,420
how this market happened and we have to

580
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:04,639
always remember that from different

581
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,080
taxes and the same quality and testing

582
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,690
standards but being able to ship

583
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,149
cannabis in the mail awesome what you

584
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,830
first started here but it's it's being

585
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,530
completely forgotten I see a major

586
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:16,970
opportunity there long term for a few of

587
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:19,069
the companies that get into it and are

588
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,630
patient focused but it's something that

589
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,220
every single market remember for the

590
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,530
u.s. getting in from a medical

591
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,839
standpoint first is how you get into the

592
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:28,549
adult use market and if you get into

593
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,619
medical and just completely forget those

594
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,299
roots it is a total addressable market

595
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:34,339
that you're just forgetting about and

596
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:36,769
then the brand licensing the loyalties

597
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:38,299
it just doesn't happen but everything we

598
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,950
know about medical cannabis and

599
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:43,430
recreational cannabis in the US and

600
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,799
Canada is the same kind of thing it's

601
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,120
not true medical this other thing is

602
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,190
going to happen called Pharma and

603
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,869
they're very interested in the space

604
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,289
it's just way too risky for them right

605
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,459
now

606
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:55,399
and we already passed this threshold

607
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,200
called a safety profile so that's the

608
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,630
major value when you develop a new drug

609
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,860
getting past that point so once you're

610
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,870
getting international you think about

611
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:04,339
pharmaceutical if you're doing clinical

612
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:06,439
trials if you're getting drug

613
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,649
registrations just like all the value of

614
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,380
Israel it's not about

615
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,910
production it's about their old medical

616
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,350
research that's gonna be applicable to

617
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,450
the rest of the world and if you're

618
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:16,980
starting to do that in Canada it's a

619
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,039
major foot in the door for this

620
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,650
international expansion you know on your

621
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,849
REC side it's gonna be big it's not

622
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,030
gonna be as big as most people think

623
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:28,589
because your taxes are too high your

624
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,210
climate cost of production or too high

625
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:32,159
your illicit market it's gonna be harder

626
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,019
to fight in Canada than it is in the

627
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,060
United States because it's been a very

628
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,740
robust program and originally medical

629
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,269
producers could produce it all over the

630
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,460
place have their own plans then they

631
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:43,740
kind of stop that once those plants are

632
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,809
out there this is a weed they grow and

633
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,609
people continue to grow it but for a

634
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,440
supplemental income source it's not as

635
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:51,479
lucrative on a long-term basis but it's

636
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,009
gonna be very challenging to fight but

637
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,110
if if anyone's bought a four-year old

638
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:57,180
joint in Canada like these packages like

639
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:00,240
take it out of the big box it's like

640
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,519
this big plastic thing a lot of lessons

641
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,349
could be learned from the United States

642
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,509
cannabis companies and what we've done

643
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:08,219
so just think what's working in the

644
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,960
United States when it comes to packaging

645
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,269
and marketing and how to actually mark

646
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,370
it on a national basis which you can do

647
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,619
here still a lot of regulations around

648
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:18,419
it we couldn't do that in the United

649
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,359
States that's why it's been so so slow

650
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,120
but adult use in Canada is gonna go fast

651
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,159
and you had a really shitty first year I

652
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,929
mean pretty pathetic for what it should

653
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,519
have been mostly based on the

654
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,470
municipality and territorial laws

655
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,509
ramping up like the retail store

656
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,660
licenses and there's more illegal stores

657
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:38,670
in BC than legal stores and they're way

658
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,080
cheaper and you just walk in like you

659
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,730
don't even have to show an ID it's

660
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,509
pretty incredible but not advocating

661
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:47,579
illicit sales when you think about where

662
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,079
Productions happening and what the tax

663
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,359
rates are there and how they give

664
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,949
permits this is very important for when

665
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,839
it comes to cost of production if you're

666
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,299
trying to do this in Manitoba or certain

667
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,519
places there's a reason their prices are

668
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:02,220
higher or a client of ours years ago

669
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,990
like Prince Edward Island like their

670
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,120
cost of production was ridiculous but

671
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,579
they were one of the only ones there now

672
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:11,099
that this is getting nationalized on a

673
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,679
larger basis it's gonna get huge but

674
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,359
something you have to remember

675
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,490
governments are more addicted to tax

676
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,229
revenue than heroin and once they get a

677
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,910
taste of it they will fight for it more

678
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,420
and more that's why we were very scared

679
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,690
about the l

680
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:27,090
CVO originally like in ontario like

681
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,620
cannabis stores just going to be done on

682
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,750
like liquor stores we're very scared

683
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,309
about it in long term I do see the

684
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,589
potentiality for this to happen

685
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:36,359
so getting retail licenses know there

686
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:40,139
could be a shift but getting them early

687
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,699
is critical to get to revenue side your

688
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,320
hemp side has also been good but you had

689
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,690
Manitoba harvest that like Hillary

690
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,950
bought yours last year your hemp

691
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,299
industry is getting less and less

692
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,059
important because there's so much

693
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:52,740
competition internationally and it's not

694
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,750
just about growing hemp here and doing

695
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,730
extraction for terpenes or cannabinoids

696
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,890
and shipping around the world but there

697
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,620
are some major opportunities to do hemp

698
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,720
in Canada still but what I do see is

699
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,669
just like the LPS they fought against

700
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,319
outdoor production really heavily in the

701
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,390
beginning because when you have a

702
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,769
Hershey's warehouse that you put tens of

703
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,750
millions of dollars in due to grill weed

704
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,730
inside and then you can just do a big

705
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,069
outdoor harvest harvest it with combines

706
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,779
and have oils and then do extracted

707
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:21,240
products it's gonna disrupt and

708
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:23,220
interrupt your entire production market

709
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,420
and it's gonna start happening soon this

710
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,480
next year the amount of outdoor

711
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,340
production that you see it's gonna start

712
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,110
to cause your price of price to come

713
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,000
down and then all of your raw plant

714
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:34,919
material or your trim from your indoor

715
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,380
facilities that's very very expensive

716
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,240
compared to outdoor it's gonna change

717
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,040
the game just like we did in Colorado

718
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,730
and California and other states that

719
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,589
allow outdoor when we think about what

720
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,819
the biggest issues are your territories

721
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:49,829
and your municipalities for their

722
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:52,349
licensing these horrible corrupt lottery

723
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:53,939
systems I mean three see we do license

724
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:57,329
applications around the world when we

725
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,680
see lotteries were almost not interested

726
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:00,809
because you can have the best team ever

727
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,370
and then just you know pull them out of

728
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,679
a hat but when you see the judge that

729
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:06,269
stalled all of the license issuance in

730
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,330
Ontario for what happened in Toronto

731
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:11,609
recently like one person randomly gets

732
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:13,470
three randomly and then you know I have

733
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:15,629
a group that puts in ten and gets none

734
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,549
you know there's issues with that and

735
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,380
it's gonna continue to happen in the

736
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:21,960
United States you see the FBI getting

737
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,220
into like that mayor in Massachusetts

738
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,019
it's like yeah you want a license here

739
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,210
600,000 bucks did it for for people

740
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:29,490
that's been happening for over a decade

741
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,440
it's nothing new and they're gonna start

742
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,420
getting into this more and more and as

743
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,259
Health Canada really tries to maintain

744
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,400
their image

745
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,710
they're gonna start looking at these

746
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,870
things deeper and deeper so just know

747
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,210
like do things legal do things compliant

748
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:43,918
do not cut corners and do not get into

749
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,669
the shady side because if you do long

750
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,500
term it will come out so a little bit

751
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:51,960
here on investing like we manage venture

752
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,029
funds private equity I see major value

753
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,160
in the private side still for Canada and

754
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,139
for the rest of the world but it's such

755
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,058
a new industry from this side most

756
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,100
institutional capital won't touch it and

757
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:04,200
banks aren't giving loans but how you

758
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:06,569
raise capital and how you look at what

759
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,819
investments are real this is a major

760
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:11,939
opportunity like I could still get 18

761
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:13,349
percent interest on real estate like I

762
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,390
say that to a normal real estate

763
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:16,859
investor and they're like what like yeah

764
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,240
you're owning a building and Triple Net

765
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,849
leasing it to the operator you're not

766
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,859
even profiting from cannabis the real

767
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,928
estate is what everything is built off

768
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,069
of from hands-on companies so if you're

769
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:27,690
looking at the real estate here in

770
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:30,629
Canada for more and more of these places

771
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,429
I'm not even interested in cultivation a

772
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,190
little interested in the processing

773
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:37,140
extremely interested in the retail real

774
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,120
estate that's what's gonna continue to

775
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,650
change and those those spaces just like

776
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,849
we see in the US will be the major

777
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:47,190
revenue drivers when you're raising

778
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:48,599
capital you have to be transparent do

779
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,660
not say that you're gonna continue to

780
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,909
sell pounds for $4,000 a pound I mean in

781
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,090
Colorado five years ago it was 4,400

782
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,200
today wholesale is less than 600 and if

783
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:59,759
you think that you're gonna be selling

784
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,798
this like your investors are gonna get

785
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,019
more and more seasoned so be honest be

786
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:05,369
transparent show how markets are going

787
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,650
to change and how you're gonna continue

788
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:10,949
to lower your costs and run this like a

789
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,540
normal business the key thing for

790
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,279
cannabis when I look at an investment

791
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:17,490
which and probably see a hundred decks a

792
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:19,019
week I take the word cannabis out if

793
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,269
you're a company would you still be

794
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,129
interesting if it wasn't just cannabis

795
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:26,429
hype oh it's CBD dryer sheets

796
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:28,559
oh it's CBD pet food like what is the

797
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,169
other market applicable to this and how

798
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:34,079
would you be an attractive like

799
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:36,090
acquisition target when you think about

800
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,918
these few big brands in the middle and

801
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,959
then all the brands that you know and

802
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,090
are familiar with around this this is

803
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,610
going to be cannabis and it's only a

804
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:46,079
matter of time and it's not going to be

805
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:47,289
consolation until Ray and Aurora in the

806
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,789
middle they're even

807
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,559
they've been trying that but they're

808
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:52,269
gonna get so crushed on stock prices in

809
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,269
this next year is they're not hitting

810
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:56,950
their projections that it's that sites

811
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,289
really hurting the investor confidence

812
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,910
in the space because it sounded so

813
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:03,039
important it was so hard to raise

814
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:05,860
capital so what's everyone do run to

815
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,230
Canada list on the CSE now there are

816
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:09,789
good public companies up here but 80

817
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,220
percent are pretty much fraudulent and

818
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,980
lie on a daily basis to investors in the

819
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,180
industry press releases about growing in

820
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,920
Malta and like what they're gonna be

821
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,890
doing here they're clinical trials so

822
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,140
they're shipping to San Diego like be

823
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,700
real be transparent but it's only a

824
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,770
matter of time until this happens and

825
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,480
you have to know your exit as a company

826
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:30,190
are you gonna cash flow or you're gonna

827
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,230
have dividends are you going to sell the

828
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,480
company are gonna join other companies

829
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,740
are you gonna go public but how is the

830
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,720
investor going to get their money back

831
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,579
how are you gonna use their capital and

832
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,620
deploy their capital and what sorts of

833
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:43,509
returns could they potentially get never

834
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:45,009
guarantee anything here but you're

835
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:46,750
trying to always think who's the bigger

836
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:49,690
fish that you're gonna buy or get bought

837
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,490
by or try to become but it's no longer

838
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,750
trying to be Philip Morris it's about

839
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,000
trying to get bought by Philip Morris

840
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,829
because this industry is normalized it's

841
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,259
getting more and more normalized and

842
00:29:56,829 --> 00:30:02,129
it's only a matter of time until the big

843
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:04,629
institutional capital comes in

844
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,430
so to go around the world here kind of

845
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,080
quickly we work all over the world just

846
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,210
to know the opportunities for Canadian

847
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,639
companies there they're not gonna

848
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,230
legalize rec anytime soon here so don't

849
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,880
don't think that's going to be the way

850
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,420
you're gonna sell vape cartridges in

851
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,980
Germany

852
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,019
I mean Germany's got less than 30

853
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,819
doctors making prescriptions less than a

854
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:24,129
quarter million total prescriptions and

855
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:25,869
the price is so high and insurance still

856
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,760
has problems with it when you're

857
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:31,059
thinking about where to produce in

858
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,470
Europe for Europe I mean a license we

859
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:34,809
have in Portugal and a few of those

860
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,850
countries very much matter because if we

861
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:38,470
can reduce cheaper and you're in Europe

862
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:40,569
they're gonna give preference over

863
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,519
buying your products but it's not just

864
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:44,289
about growing in Germany or growing like

865
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,150
we got two of the eleven licenses in

866
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:47,470
Denmark I didn't build a building there

867
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,330
I sold a license for five and a half

868
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,700
million the other one I'm keeping for

869
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:53,109
importing to Denmark but you have to

870
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,880
think what's the cost of reduction in

871
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:56,889
each market how is it applicable to the

872
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,780
rest of a union or a pharmaceutical act

873
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,100
and how that's going to be a bigger play

874
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:01,210
not just that you have a license in

875
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:03,429
Zimbabwe now you're late

876
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,350
doubled your value that's been the major

877
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:09,370
problem here but Europe will be a huge

878
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:11,230
market with more doctor education so if

879
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:12,909
you are a pub Co or a private Co no

880
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,650
matter where you are internationally you

881
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,660
must focus on doctor and patient

882
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,610
education because without it there are

883
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,230
no prescriptions and not like

884
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:22,809
recommendations in the US or

885
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,779
prescriptions here but you have to have

886
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:27,429
those otherwise there's no business

887
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:29,049
you're thinking about Africa a couple of

888
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,549
these colors aren't coming through the

889
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,379
only major countries that matter is

890
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:33,639
South Africa and Lesotho right now and

891
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,830
of course there's Canadian public

892
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,240
companies in each of those all of the

893
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:39,129
other countries that have really come

894
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,230
forward with programs are not compliant

895
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,090
with international law but the reason I

896
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,890
love South Africa is that they're a

897
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:48,399
Picts country which means what they do

898
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,360
there matters the same as the FDA so

899
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,910
when you're thinking about international

900
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,929
cannabis how is it applicable with the

901
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,400
rest of the world and if you're

902
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,070
developing products there or

903
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,780
intellectual property how that's gonna

904
00:31:57,069 --> 00:32:01,629
scale or be applicable to other markets

905
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:03,099
but Africa for you anymore I always

906
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,050
think where can I produce in a country

907
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:06,909
or continent for that country or

908
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:08,619
continent under their laws other than

909
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,080
just thinking I'm going to do European

910
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:13,029
GMP everyone thought that at first it's

911
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,500
way more expensive and challenging to

912
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:17,200
get than you think and if you mess up

913
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,279
your first inspection they're maybe not

914
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,500
coming back ever

915
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:23,230
and like when those Germans come to your

916
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,299
place in Macedonia or you know to George

917
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,950
or wherever you're going to be producing

918
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:29,319
if it's not ready and right you're

919
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,519
screwed and if they don't come back or

920
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:33,639
if they don't come back for two or three

921
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,660
years you have no market to sell to so

922
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,430
by the time you get into these

923
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,710
international standards hire good

924
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,360
consultants for it hire good experts

925
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,829
that know it hire good legal that know

926
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,599
it to show how it's going to be

927
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:45,099
applicable other than just trying to

928
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,579
have a press release to be able to like

929
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:50,319
get investors interested in your space

930
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:52,019
this has been a slow one for us I know

931
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,279
that like the imports for South Korea

932
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:56,859
everyone was talking about Thailand for

933
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,720
a while anyone realized Thailand is just

934
00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:00,939
for domestic purposes in research right

935
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,500
now it's not about producing in Thailand

936
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,150
all cheap and selling to the rest of the

937
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,220
world they don't have a law that allows

938
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,110
that and yes you can educate the

939
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,150
government and help with that but if

940
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:11,939
it's for domestic production how does

941
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,690
that help your Canadian public value

942
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,620
especially for a total addressable

943
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,539
market that does

944
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:20,019
have qualifying conditions that are like

945
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:21,609
pain PTSD glaucoma like internationally

946
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:25,058
if there's not qualifying conditions of

947
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:27,429
pain or PTSD in the US that's 96% of all

948
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:30,099
medical cards that means that you're

949
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,320
gonna have no one like Texas childhood

950
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:33,759
epilepsy it means you have 1,300 kids

951
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,308
you could potentially sell products do

952
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,829
with those three licenses granted Texas

953
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:41,799
is the third highest population in the

954
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:43,869
country but there's no total addressable

955
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:46,500
market based on qualifying conditions so

956
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:48,519
that part is key for international

957
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,650
Austria none of those colors came

958
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,329
through but Australia's been really slow

959
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,309
and interesting a few big changes are

960
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:55,869
coming they're more licenses and there

961
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:57,308
they are a picks country which means

962
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:59,199
their standards are going to be good for

963
00:33:57,308 --> 00:34:00,849
international some of the few good

964
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,259
Australian companies that can take and

965
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:04,928
focus on this region are gonna do

966
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:06,429
incredible with New Zealand's reck kind

967
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:07,990
of medical programs challenging getting

968
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:10,389
better it's wrecked kind of coming

969
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,639
soonish gonna be good but don't talk

970
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,378
about your Vanuatu rec company gonna

971
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,970
like change the world like shipwrecked

972
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:18,759
cannabis to Canada and undercut them

973
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,799
because Health Canada is really really

974
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,600
protective of your market right now they

975
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,250
won't even allow exports of genetics

976
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,960
anymore for most of our companies and

977
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,309
the same thing from like an import

978
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,470
standpoint they're really trying to

979
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:31,509
protect this market so trying to import

980
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,878
to Canada is not the best acquisition

981
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:37,210
strategy to like be buying or trying to

982
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,918
develop towards at this point none of

983
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,148
the colors here again unfortunately but

984
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:42,668
you've got four or five medical

985
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:45,849
countries Colombia has really taken all

986
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:48,549
the news in Colombia of course near the

987
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:50,469
equator low cost of production they're

988
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,659
only allowed 40,000 tons of annual

989
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:54,219
production as a country my license in

990
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,628
Portugal is four hundred and

991
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:58,059
thirty-eight thousand tonnes a year by

992
00:34:55,628 --> 00:35:00,369
the UN it's like one license of mine is

993
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:03,400
like 11 times the entire country of

994
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:03,639
Colombia and Colombia Khan has a season

995
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,920
pass

996
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:07,719
I love Colombia very much most of the

997
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,190
genetics that the Canadian LP shipped

998
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,829
down there were there dankest coolest

999
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,690
buds from indoor warehouses up here that

1000
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:16,150
don't grow very well in greenhouses in

1001
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,220
Colombia hence all the mold issues and

1002
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,660
so forth there will be five or six

1003
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:21,189
amazing companies that come out of

1004
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:24,250
Colombia but it's the non psychoactive

1005
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:26,320
licenses to focus on for now and again

1006
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,280
wearing in South America or Central

1007
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,440
America can you produce

1008
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,450
for the rest of that area under their

1009
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,119
standards compared to trying to do EU

1010
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:37,129
GMP and Colombia to ship to the rest of

1011
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,690
the world or Europe that's harder it's

1012
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,849
gonna take more time it's gonna take a

1013
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:43,579
long time to get to that revenue you get

1014
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:46,639
to get total revenue first if you focus

1015
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:48,469
on that region first you know I always

1016
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,059
use and kind of close with this like I

1017
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:51,769
remember like being in Boy Scouts and

1018
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:54,289
playing risk like late at night and like

1019
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:56,139
wanting to stab people and like 12-hour

1020
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:58,730
games and like I hate this person now

1021
00:35:56,139 --> 00:36:01,429
it's very similar right now and all the

1022
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:04,010
LPS are like little childish boys

1023
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:05,419
playing you know what a fire station you

1024
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,920
know during Boy Scouts when they're kids

1025
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,599
they're like I'm gonna take over the

1026
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,180
world I got Australia that's two troops

1027
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:13,279
in South America that's three and where

1028
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:14,809
you put your pieces matter and you got

1029
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,850
one shot for where you're gonna put your

1030
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:18,529
pieces on the board today and where

1031
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:20,799
you're gonna establish partnerships and

1032
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,510
relationships and raise capital or like

1033
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,610
Amazon on billions and billions not sir

1034
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:28,160
paying certain taxes where your domicile

1035
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,809
where you have capital coming in and

1036
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,389
going out of and how you're gonna trade

1037
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,980
you think about where all the Canadian

1038
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:35,659
public companies that launched up here

1039
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,250
that was the easy place that's why

1040
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:40,519
everyone did it and was so unregulated

1041
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,780
like practical pink slip type listings

1042
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,480
that should have never been listed as

1043
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,910
public companies the same [ __ ] is about

1044
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,920
to happen in London in Frankfurt in

1045
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:50,809
Israel and Tel Aviv exchange in the

1046
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,430
Australian exchange you're gonna see

1047
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,259
probably a thousand public companies

1048
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:55,759
launch in this next year that are

1049
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,040
cannabis companies that have nothing

1050
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,870
going on but there will be some good

1051
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:01,550
ones in there but with the CSE and

1052
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:03,259
others not allowing blind shorting

1053
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,240
anymore they know there's a problem in

1054
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,830
this market and they know that it's

1055
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,899
going to continue to go down and some of

1056
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:10,909
them will scale and be incredible we've

1057
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,519
got one shot now to put this on and

1058
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:15,559
partnerships you know in human evolution

1059
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,440
you've got competition and you've got

1060
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:21,289
collaboration collaboration always wins

1061
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,940
like fighting people you know doesn't

1062
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:24,440
wins like what can you do who can you

1063
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,599
partner with how can you get bigger

1064
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,730
because your company no matter how good

1065
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,829
it is there's others doing the same

1066
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,150
thing and you're not that special you're

1067
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:33,679
not that unique even though you might

1068
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,250
grow the dankus flower or have the

1069
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,659
coolest water-soluble concentrates how

1070
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,190
you're going to partner with people how

1071
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,889
you're going to get distribution how

1072
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,230
you're going to raise additional capital

1073
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:46,389
like its capital raise capital raise

1074
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,699
capital raise and more markets but it's

1075
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,980
not about vape pens from Canada being

1076
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,960
shipped to the world know the rules of

1077
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,969
each of these jurisdictions find local

1078
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,280
partnerships there that know that market

1079
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:59,409
and can scale that market with you other

1080
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,060
than trying to go over like an aurora or

1081
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:03,369
a canopy and trying to take over the

1082
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:04,989
world by yourself it didn't work for

1083
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:07,719
Alexander the Great you get too far away

1084
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:09,609
from your home base and then everything

1085
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,609
crumbles didn't work for Rome either

1086
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:15,340
like you can only grow so fast so far

1087
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,349
but cannabis is here to stay I mean it's

1088
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,360
going to disrupt almost all industries

1089
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,309
that we know everyone talks about hemp

1090
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,280
CBD right now what about paper and

1091
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:25,900
cotton and timbers and plastics the long

1092
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,060
term play for this industry is

1093
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,889
phenomenal and getting an early stage

1094
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:31,750
into the private companies doing it is

1095
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:33,579
where I've seen the biggest returns

1096
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,070
that's why we focus on that and know

1097
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:37,690
that once this boards established just

1098
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,940
like monopoly you can only buy a hotel

1099
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,940
or get boardwalk or Broadway like one

1100
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,619
time you get it solidify it raise it and

1101
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,539
protect the hell out of it

1102
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:48,400
I see more value for intellectual

1103
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:50,469
property right now than even cannabis

1104
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,880
that's why constellation and a lot of

1105
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:54,849
these other companies in canopy they're

1106
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,559
buying ship companies that just did some

1107
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:58,299
really nice IP protections for things

1108
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,219
they're gonna need in the future so

1109
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,440
whatever you're doing protect it get

1110
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:04,689
legal get compliant it's the only way to

1111
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:09,119
transition and get your pieces on the

1112
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,599
board early not sure how I am on time

1113
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,279
four minutes

1114
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,869
awesome well thanks for letting me share

1115
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,700
any any quick questions from anybody

1116
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:19,150
here yes sir

1117
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:20,649
one more time for Nick Easley no thank

1118
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,519
you buddy

1119
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,639
[Music]

1120
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:29,210
always informative here

1121
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:32,608
and remember questions go up at the end

1122
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,960
like not a question about strategy we're

1123
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,519
seeing a lot of companies going into

1124
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,380
Canada taking advantage of the publicly

1125
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:38,880
traded markets and bringing that capital

1126
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,160
back into the US a lot of them are

1127
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,650
buying hemp and in order to get across

1128
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,529
the 280e provisions probably with the

1129
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:49,440
strategy of utilizing THC down the road

1130
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,819
but what about Puerto Rico right now for

1131
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,139
a lot of companies going into the u.s.

1132
00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:54,210
Puerto Rico is the only place in the

1133
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:57,598
world you can go and not be forced to

1134
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:59,280
pay US income tax so for CBD companies a

1135
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,140
lot of them won't survive without that

1136
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,440
kind of benefit where do you see Puerto

1137
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:05,940
Rico being in the mix with international

1138
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,250
cannabis as a strategy

1139
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,358
you got that 183 day clause for

1140
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,889
residency which kind of makes it

1141
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,308
challenging great question in the u.s.

1142
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:16,558
that IRC 280 e it's a tax law from 1982

1143
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:17,910
to keep cocaine smugglers from being

1144
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,760
able to have like laundromats and like

1145
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:23,279
launder their money we can't

1146
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,020
doctor our cost of goods sold I mean -

1147
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,490
hurricanes and a few things Puerto Rico

1148
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,769
could be good from a tourist standpoint

1149
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:31,108
I didn't focus on that territory I

1150
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:32,309
focused on Guam I mean I've got 1.6

1151
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:34,679
billion people that live within a

1152
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:36,480
four-hour flight of Guam medicals legal

1153
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,210
Rex legal incoming and it's very very

1154
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,650
hard the CBD side is gonna be a lot less

1155
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,740
regulated soon because we had our first

1156
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,900
farm bill 2014 the 18 farm bill and now

1157
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,308
it's starting to change with a few of

1158
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,349
the banking laws that are in the Senate

1159
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:53,010
right now the CBD side and the hemp side

1160
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:55,019
should have banking by 2020 and also not

1161
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,089
have IRC 280 which is the foot in the

1162
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,679
door which then means cannabis companies

1163
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,078
soon won't have to deal with that once

1164
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:02,548
medical legalization happens could be

1165
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,109
some interesting domicile plays

1166
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:05,579
therefore like that being domiciled

1167
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:07,828
shipped there and then shipped to the US

1168
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,839
I haven't seen anyone take advantage of

1169
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:13,829
it yet but it's it's definitely for the

1170
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:15,710
CBD side of potentiality well it's great

1171
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:17,818
any other questions

1172
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,880
all right well let's go eat them one

1173
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:19,900
more time easily thank you all very much

1174
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,099

1175
