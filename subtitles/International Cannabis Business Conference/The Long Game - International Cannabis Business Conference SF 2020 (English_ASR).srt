1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,790
the long game well it should be awesome

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,469
well yeah I'm Nikki's Liam CEO 3c

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,019
consulting just made it back from

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,789
America or from South America this is

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,650
really important not a lawyer I'm not a

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,559
CPA a lot of those past people great

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,609
titles use these professionals without

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,959
them you're screwed

9
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,240
most of the things we've seen in the

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,769
last 10 years were problems from legal

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,659
structuring not understanding the laws

12
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,159
or like horrible tax burdens we're gonna

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,689
make a [ __ ] ton of money but then you

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,010
had horrible accounting in one company

15
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,439
and the investors wouldn't come in

16
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,340
correctly so use these professionals and

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,859
just business guidance here originally

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,390
from Wisconsin did military after

19
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,850
military went to Colorado right time

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,399
right place 2006 right when it was like

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,320
medical cannabis cards on the wall - hey

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,549
we're doing compliant business so that's

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,460
when I came in and have seen this

24
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,839
evolution happen have worked all over

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,539
the place in terms of states and

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,890
countries a lot of similarities market

27
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,480
to market but some of the things that I

28
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,770
see and least for where this markets

29
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,229
going may be a little different than

30
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,780
most people because I've been inside so

31
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,938
many of the companies it's not just

32
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,590
reading online articles or it's meeting

33
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,449
with prime ministers seeing delegation

34
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,549
work going into a company when they've

35
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,159
got 250 people and they're not let's say

36
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,310
making payroll and super inefficient or

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,439
didn't plan their business operations or

38
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,299
for fungal diseases 9 pestis throwing a

39
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,919
huge multi-million dollar company that

40
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,049
when you see those parts of the company

41
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,090
that's where you can see what are the

42
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,170
common trends where is this really going

43
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,400
and it's not small scale a little

44
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,019
warehouses like Colorado back in the day

45
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,280
seeing this now I think international

46
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,618
cannabis business this one has been

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,599
amazing from a conference and for years

48
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,099
and years seeing now like what's

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,319
happened in this last four to five years

50
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,449
since they started everyone thinks about

51
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,239
Canada or Uruguay for legalizing adult

52
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,680
use like definitely not legal

53
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,868
internationally at this point with laws

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,180
and policies but with 19 countries

55
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:57,930
having some sort of import-export or

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,509
production business it's really going to

57
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,390
be amazing but it sucks so much right

58
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,859
now because you have to hold these

59
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,290
positions in these countries that don't

60
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,899
have massive demand don't have doctors

61
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,969
making prescriptions it's not the same

62
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,990
the German cannabis market ask the

63
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,849
American cannabis Mart

64
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,800
thinking legalized medical but you're

65
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:19,469
thinking prescriptions and doctors and

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,000
then Europe having novel foods and how

67
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:22,590
those regulations are gonna affect a

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,780
cannabis business there compared to

69
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,210
we're gonna sell vape cartridges in

70
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,979
Austria probably probably not the same

71
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,560
basis so everything international other

72
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,329
than Canada Uruguay think API active

73
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,759
pharmaceutical ingredient markets bulk

74
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,830
flower and if it's flower it's not

75
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,259
trimmed fancy like in a bag like this is

76
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,900
danca [ __ ] weed it's usually ground up

77
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,179
and unidentifiable so your whole process

78
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,439
is if you're a Canadian for example and

79
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,719
then went to grow in Israel or in

80
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,909
Denmark all of a sudden you're growing

81
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,469
one sort of specification of a product

82
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,299
that's not meant for the whole market

83
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,759
and your whole business plan was wrong

84
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,740
so country by country how they relate

85
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,019
whose pharmaceutical compacts work

86
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,240
together how the UN of the whe OHS

87
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,490
recommendations this March could be like

88
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,189
step two of the step three endgame for

89
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,960
cannabis but it's happening but a lot of

90
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,490
countries talk about this there are

91
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,560
opportunities everywhere but if their

92
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,939
laws are not correct you're going to

93
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,560
completely fail like a Zimbabwe LSU to a

94
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:22,289
Swaziland if it's not correct modeled on

95
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,819
these laws you really have to be very

96
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,679
careful in navigating which ones are

97
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,759
coming up here because some are just

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,840
gonna like waste your time would be

99
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,729
painful most of these businesses

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,979
compliance is unique here in Canada or

101
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:36,840
here in California and Canada but each

102
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,699
place is different so if you're thinking

103
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,319
of a hands-on company and you're

104
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,439
investing in them or operating them like

105
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,030
what rules do you have to follow how do

106
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,680
these rules change how do you have

107
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,240
enough capital to do this and most

108
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,909
people they get this license they see

109
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,170
huge value which that's massive

110
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,449
opportunities with these limited

111
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,799
licenses in states and countries but

112
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,859
they don't realize that that piece of

113
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,180
paper is the whole thing that matters so

114
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,040
how do we not lose this piece of paper

115
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,230
not just how do we make a consumer

116
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:08,549
package female wellness hemp lifestyle

117
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,869
brand for example it's that aspect so

118
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,150
it's really important to build

119
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,469
everything off of but most people don't

120
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,259
know how to cover their ass in the space

121
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:19,439
or think what is the value in your

122
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,569
opportunity it's the piece of paper when

123
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,939
we think you know I put ATF on here like

124
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,409
Alcohol Tobacco Firearms they get to

125
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,399
have all the fun stuff maybe it goes

126
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,229
that way but when you

127
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,549
of what we're doing and why certain

128
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:34,228
companies have come in on an investment

129
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,639
opportunity it's just barely begun but

130
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:37,680
now is the bleeding like when we're

131
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,449
almost at 20 billion dollars in industry

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,160
annually that's just the hands-on

133
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,660
opportunities what what's really gonna

134
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,660
gonna play out here and who's gonna

135
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,699
control it from a US basis as well as an

136
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,919
international basis so some of these

137
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,629
opportunities we're not gonna we don't

138
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,758
grow tobacco in every single state and

139
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:55,350
have like there's a different tax like

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,300
state-by-state or why doesn't our good

141
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,220
beer out of Colorado make it to all

142
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,930
these other markets it's because there's

143
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,970
these different taxes regulations to us

144
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,180
we're going towards federal side it's a

145
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,889
when ya think how are you gonna play

146
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,660
into that with these opportunities not

147
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,180
just I have a cool dispensary in

148
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,510
Berkeley or I have a delivery company in

149
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,250
San Luis Obispo or I have 10,000 Eric

150
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,370
acres of flowering canopy or something

151
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,620
somewhere so to beat the odds here

152
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,769
there's tens of thousands of us now as

153
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,418
companies businesses individuals and

154
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:30,149
most people don't realize how their

155
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,409
little operation is gonna weather this

156
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:33,089
next storms you're already sealing it's

157
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,130
not as fun as it used to be but it's way

158
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:36,869
more fun on different levels this is

159
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:39,449
what changes things for the hands-on

160
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,500
companies be it any sort if they don't

161
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,900
integrate with their communities

162
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,500
correctly they have the biggest problems

163
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:48,448
from a tax rate standpoint from you know

164
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,180
being bothered or not choosing the right

165
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,800
opportunities so choose a good place be

166
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,389
involved with that community and don't

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,189
be an [ __ ] in that community very

168
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,000
very important like the good neighbor

169
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,978
policies and in California with your

170
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,529
compassionate carrot prop D prop em 2:15

171
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:06,658
temp state state license process or or

172
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,038
any other jurisdiction if you didn't

173
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:11,339
have that community piece along the way

174
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,469
those are the ones that fail the people

175
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,629
are crazy huge I've realized it's now

176
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,669
more than ever over a decade that each

177
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,110
company's operation as you're building

178
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,478
these teams or when we look at

179
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,400
investment opportunities where if it's a

180
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,199
team in another country or another state

181
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,060
like that had to bring in expertise how

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,129
did they do it how are they doing well I

183
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,959
see way too many good businesses just

184
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,879
fail without good people and it's not

185
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,859
just getting some advisors but you need

186
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,918
your local people and really understand

187
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,230
the operation there's so many outside

188
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,839
industries that are applicable

189
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,340
to this space and the people and their

190
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,899
skillsets but you have a very limited

191
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,879
window where you can take applicable and

192
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:48,079
make it awesome in this space otherwise

193
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,120
they just crush it because it's not

194
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,789
something else but it's very similar but

195
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,379
yeah the biggest things that I see

196
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,210
important for people it's what they

197
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:58,250
bring cannabis can be taught trained

198
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:00,769
learned other than the specific little

199
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,920
pieces but we need some rock stars in

200
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:05,359
these companies now this is kind of a I

201
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,400
think for all the companies and

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,629
countries that I work the most important

203
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,199
thing that happens time and time again

204
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,000
is where how I think about this growing

205
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,680
long term in greenhouses in California

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
for flowers gonna work for certain

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,340
places but the taxes suck here there's

208
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,740
not that much water everyone's excited

209
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,449
about hemp and cannabis here but we

210
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,540
don't grow all of our watermelons here

211
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,800
or peppers or tomatoes or roses we're

212
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,750
pretty lazy when it comes to that

213
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,129
standpoint for cost or you go to

214
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,209
Colombian like the coffee's kind of

215
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:33,740
shitty and up here you're like lemming

216
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,029
cough it's really good or like the

217
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,949
apples in Chile a couple weeks ago they

218
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,739
were like crappy and little like I

219
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,269
always see big Chilean apples our market

220
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,759
is where products drive - same with

221
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:46,729
European markets so when I think about

222
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,409
Peru or Columbia or Uruguay or Mexico at

223
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,720
the end of April like what do these

224
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,280
things mean or maybe a huge thing in

225
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,290
Austria could be greater we're gonna

226
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,389
have a giant concrete warehouse growing

227
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,189
amazing can of medical cannabis in

228
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,060
Germany or the Netherlands but how much

229
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,980
does that cost

230
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,860
what are those crazy taxes what are the

231
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,300
operational costs average wages of the

232
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,819
Colombian workers I was just at was like

233
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,920
350 US a month so it's like just pay him

234
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,139
five and they're like they're stoked and

235
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,730
it's amazing for them same thing when we

236
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,990
thought Macedonia if you don't think

237
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,000
about these costs like how much is the

238
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,000
cost of an employee in California the

239
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,860
state sucks and so it's not as bad as

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,750
France it sucks when it comes to

241
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,009
employment law and we have to do the

242
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,540
best with these companies but if you

243
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,069
don't think about cost how to do it

244
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,410
consistently with certain quality

245
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:31,969
assurance quality control systems and

246
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,860
management your visions and dreams just

247
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,060
fail and they pop all over the world and

248
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,950
it's just ooh

249
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,659
22 million dollars here six million

250
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,310
dollars lost there oh this is a great

251
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,500
thing you can't just sell your garbage

252
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:44,869
to Canadian public companies anymore so

253
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,629
that whole idea of develop everything

254
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,100
and just flip it just doesn't work and I

255
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:51,230
like this little farm guy I'm from

256
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,730
Wisconsin with milk and it's like you

257
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,800
don't want a CBD

258
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,389
me right now like what's the Krait

259
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,078
what's the price right now of a kilo of

260
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,399
like high-quality CBD distillates or CBG

261
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,929
or any other of the hundreds of

262
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,570
cannabinoids it wasn't that good of an

263
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:07,789
idea it was a short period of time or

264
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,000
think no offense like a gen canna or a

265
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:13,759
great business model but like what

266
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,578
happens so everyone's doing something

267
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,470
any CBD side company right now on a

268
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:20,179
European basis you better be ready to

269
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,209
understand like novel foods it's

270
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:25,309
happening so there'll be very very few

271
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,299
bonafide CBD companies in Europe and

272
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,159
they won't produce it there it's

273
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,078
expensive as hell where do these inputs

274
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,990
now that you're gonna get for two

275
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:35,899
thousand two kilo 1500 what about when

276
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,669
the price of distillate goes to 200 200

277
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,980
euros let's say a like a high quality

278
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:42,708
kilo your business model gonna survive

279
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,850
that like so that the distillates and

280
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,799
the base products for these are

281
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,519
important but don't just jump on certain

282
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,958
bandwagons

283
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,820
or because everyone's going into a

284
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,429
market can be really dangerous I've seen

285
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,860
that get unique with these sorts of

286
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:56,299
products if you're making products or

287
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,039
have a dispensary or manufacturing

288
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:01,399
company like know the rules of that

289
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:03,528
marketplace and be specific from seeing

290
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,958
wanna and Kota and Kiva and bang like

291
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:08,299
every great kind of start of a company

292
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,679
what is it that they did well how do you

293
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:11,599
either hitch onto something like that or

294
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,739
define a space or if you're in a new

295
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,300
state like Illinois and you get a

296
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,068
recreational infuse your license or

297
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,838
something how to make like unique

298
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:19,370
products with that instead of we're

299
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,829
gonna make vape pens and cartridges and

300
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,159
sublinguals and suppositories and like

301
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:26,509
be specific with your product offerings

302
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,519
it's not just green fields I like this

303
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:30,169
lavender there's so many opportunities

304
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,360
of them just we're gonna grow dried

305
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:34,789
flower and we're gonna make oils and

306
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,899
we're going to the things that most

307
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:37,759
people are looking at are complete

308
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:39,620
failures now because it's they didn't

309
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,809
understand the commodification of

310
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,490
cannabis and that's where like taxes

311
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,609
agricultural vectors daytime highs

312
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,698
nighttime lows cheap land not ninety

313
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,709
percent clay soil like perfect climates

314
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:53,479
to do this or to process this under a

315
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:56,149
high standards and when you think

316
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,209
international that API like with these

317
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,769
brands they're not they're not thinking

318
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,018
correctly about what actually makes a

319
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,009
qualified brand market by market and the

320
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:05,750
best thing you can do if you're a

321
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,629
California company or others with this

322
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,039
is

323
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,328
how do you have a let's say Delaware

324
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,639
company and intellectual property

325
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:14,039
company license that intellectual

326
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,810
property market to market easily and

327
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,879
just have different cannabis licenses in

328
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,439
the other countries but how do you do

329
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,838
things consistently across the board

330
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,839
when we can't franchise we can't cross

331
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,190
interstate lines I can't so pull from

332
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,440
some of the best ideas that you can on

333
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,779
that side when you think about medical

334
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,420
markets or recreational markets you know

335
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,769
inside the United States us rec markets

336
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,629
are very different and awesome but

337
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,759
expensive from the tax standpoint if you

338
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:42,120
don't do it correctly and this is where

339
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,379
what 10 almost 11 states now thinking

340
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,230
finally Maine coming on board

341
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,360
Massachusetts Illinois just indicative

342
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,209
of future markets for at least a while

343
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,889
but that's state you think what 12

344
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,349
current producers 40 more small ones

345
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:58,139
come online 13 million people twice the

346
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,639
size of Colorado we're doing about 2

347
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,459
plus billion a year and the Midwest

348
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,500
sucks for example more people gonna use

349
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,869
cannabis because it's flat and gray like

350
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,549
these are huge markets just exploding in

351
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,769
our backyard here where other ones have

352
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:12,419
already happened medical is hard I'm a

353
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,519
medical patient from disabled military

354
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,708
side and that market is so critical to

355
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,149
do right establish it for standards do

356
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,309
it for patients and when you switch to

357
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,289
adult use which is a when I don't like

358
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:24,328
maintain that same like health standards

359
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:26,639
there and really protect medical

360
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:28,318
programs it's so anyone that's in the

361
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,899
industry that's not giving to like the

362
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:33,448
groups that make new markets for us aka

363
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,649
like more patients more profits more

364
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,448
people that need help like you're an

365
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,509
[ __ ] so if you're in the rat game or

366
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:40,740
the medical game like fight for more

367
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,750
legalization and help in patients rights

368
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,188
it's what we've hooked on to like pretty

369
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,500
much take over the world and it's the

370
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:47,789
most important thing to it's almost like

371
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,769
for the first time in our industry in

372
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:51,240
the history of business if you do the

373
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,370
right thing for like people in the

374
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,500
markets and like planet like you're not

375
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,778
growing 14th floor hydroponic indoor

376
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,269
warehouses in San Francisco high tech

377
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:02,100
you have 20,000 hectares in Colombia

378
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,409
with massive extraction and shipping

379
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,209
that for brands created here what's the

380
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,559
impact environmentally so you make more

381
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,938
money in this industry doing the right

382
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,169
thing it's the first time ever it just

383
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:12,838
cost more money to do it in the

384
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,889
beginning but it's worth it when we

385
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,529
think about what were the biggest

386
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,850
problems is peaches I don't know if you

387
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,958
know peaches I

388
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,110
figured out how to make that slide

389
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,299
myself Canada I've had a problem with

390
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,459
four five six years from the LP private

391
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:28,559
side to how public companies happened so

392
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,659
when I googled Canada sucks for like a

393
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,979
picture I found peaches who didn't like

394
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:33,360
the club scene but the cannabis scene

395
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,879
there the problem was they were first

396
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,949
and now with like the crash of Canadian

397
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,299
public markets which everyone thought

398
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:40,889
we're gonna be so cool for so long like

399
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:42,240
go public be billionaire it's not the

400
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,190
best thing when you're building scalable

401
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,500
companies but they turn the whole world

402
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,569
off to canvas right now in a way no

403
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,278
offense but with their population the

404
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:53,250
expectations and true values of

405
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,828
companies its hurt investor confidence

406
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,958
on private capital or the right capital

407
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:59,849
to grow businesses now and they're not

408
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,929
doing that great and if you were in that

409
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,019
it was kind of a bummer where you

410
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:06,179
thought speculation but just lying about

411
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,220
future valuations and hurting in but

412
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,629
investor expectations we're at this

413
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,490
point now where if you need even like

414
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,929
working capital for a business doing

415
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,000
twenty million dollars in revenue a year

416
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,278
it can be challenging but this is the

417
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,870
best time to invest into private

418
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,610
companies because they're desperate

419
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,110
they're they're proven and they're

420
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,629
scalable and it's kind of that moment of

421
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:27,180
desperation where you can make some like

422
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:29,399
epic wins right now but also it means

423
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:32,789
really good companies are failing and

424
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,230
they're having problems scale and they

425
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,338
didn't plan for these big things and

426
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,720
like I said you couldn't just sell

427
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,000
yourself to one of these big [ __ ]

428
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,490
they get five ten a hundred times your

429
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,198
actual value so now it's like the truth

430
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,909
is really setting in for a lot of

431
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,559
companies and they have to entrench now

432
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:48,269
for the next couple months like to

433
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,188
really get good positive capital coming

434
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,649
in again but don't be like peaches like

435
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:54,299
don't be like Canada you know in the

436
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,370
United States for our big opportunities

437
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,528
it's still market by market by market

438
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,778
and within these markets there's market

439
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:03,028
evolution and time and businesses change

440
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:05,159
and then new laws will happen there's

441
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,750
like a new product offering but at this

442
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,490
point I found this really fun picture of

443
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,089
cannibalism

444
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,709
it's happening and that's also a very

445
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:16,350
profitable business model where you have

446
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:18,388
how many brands in California how many

447
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,069
if you're not paying for shelf space or

448
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,659
you're near borders or if you don't have

449
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:23,698
really good distribution contracts

450
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,620
you're awesome humble weeds not making

451
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:27,990
it to the market same thing in these

452
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,149
other states like distribution is key

453
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,379
and it's you're thinking about federal

454
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,509
legalization

455
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,188
alcohol Liquor Distribution licenses

456
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:37,379
tobacco type taxes when we think about

457
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:39,149
investments and placements it's what is

458
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,889
it going to look like in that scheme but

459
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:42,839
there is so much cannibalism happening

460
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,249
now and it's profitable and it's like

461
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,399
never thought that'd be good but in

462
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:48,359
cannabis as some market establishes only

463
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,908
so many companies are going to be

464
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:54,089
leaders but for in Canada the same thing

465
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:56,068
is starting to happen to you which I'll

466
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,419
get into a little bit for the next part

467
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,399
of the year these are the most important

468
00:15:57,418 --> 00:16:02,009
markets that I see other than existing

469
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,078
in current markets or figuring out how

470
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:07,918
to recapitalize those assets let's just

471
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,138
say aka cannibalism West Virginia's

472
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:12,149
almost do we're super engaged in busy

473
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,729
and have been in Illinois just to

474
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,859
establish more 275 more dispensaries 40

475
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:18,509
more cultivation and extractions West

476
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:20,278
Virginia a nice cute little verticals

477
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,709
not that crazy heart but really good

478
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,178
market to start mass has been a mess but

479
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,918
it's gonna get better

480
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,448
Maine is gonna start but their governor

481
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,098
was an [ __ ] so it's been so long and

482
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:30,748
not gonna be that great cuz there's tons

483
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:33,959
of illicit market it's like the

484
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:37,678
California of the East Coast and Cali

485
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,758
I'm back it's big e reference this is

486
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:40,379
what we're currently working on in

487
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,729
California if you're here I figured I'd

488
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,158
go through the current markets that are

489
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:46,158
very important for new business as well

490
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:49,048
asked these ones are about to open and

491
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:50,938
any new market like we studied the laws

492
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:53,038
the policies the procedures of that

493
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:56,548
place is it worth going or not are these

494
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:57,989
opportunities valuable or not and it's

495
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,970
not as valuable just to get a license

496
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:01,679
and think you'll get capitalized easily

497
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,658
and someone will just you still have to

498
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:06,869
run the business so this is step one for

499
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:08,699
these new companies internationally I

500
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:11,038
know we're getting close here watch what

501
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,449
happens in Vienna later with the w8 show

502
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,068
if their recommendations come out for

503
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,528
the UN like I said it's step two of step

504
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:18,209
three and like federal where every

505
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:20,609
hundred and eighty six member country of

506
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,439
the UN single treaty if a doctor makes a

507
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:25,408
prescription they have to provide

508
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,379
medicine if then awesome that means that

509
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:29,669
are they going to all produce cannabis

510
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:31,500
in their little markets like Finland

511
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,700
probably not they're gonna like buy

512
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,829
pharmaceutical products from other

513
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,139
places or the bulk oils or the bulk

514
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:39,298
flour so it's not like the US I get a

515
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:41,069
get a thing to like produce in each

516
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:42,778
place it's like where can you do it best

517
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,159
at the highest standards and supply that

518
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:45,869
future market demand

519
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,509
the lowest cost and highest quality

520
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:50,039
standards it's gonna be so enormous

521
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:52,950
the pharmaceutical all of this site is

522
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,750
so expensive preclinical CRO work phase

523
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,279
one two three like these well we're

524
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,980
seeing that was incredible but this is

525
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,339
the world we play in doing us trials

526
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,299
studies anything the us super expensive

527
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:05,009
kind of a bummer do it other places

528
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,079
first cheaper and then get the same

529
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,049
standards with like pics countries for

530
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,490
example um what I think really what's

531
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:12,839
big for the future I don't know if you

532
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,309
know this guy Salvador he's like the

533
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:19,889
longest known shipwreck survivor like

534
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:23,369
4469 days went fishing with his homie a

535
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,410
year and a half later select be a

536
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:27,779
survivor also is homie

537
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,460
he said died four months into it and he

538
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,859
put him in the water speaking back to

539
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,100
cannibalism there but Salvador was the

540
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,689
[ __ ] man so if he can do it you can

541
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,490
too if you're having hard times like

542
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,740
this market it's amazing in the new

543
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,269
business but the truth is starting to

544
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,609
come out like I haven't even been in

545
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,539
America for four months and just working

546
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:47,490
with the companies seeing what's

547
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,200
happening it's this this interesting

548
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,640
moment we all figured would happen we

549
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,210
didn't think it would be this hard this

550
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,160
long and persistent but the market is

551
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,309
only gonna get better so you think about

552
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,800
how to vision airily prospect in the

553
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,539
industry are the laws good are the

554
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,369
climates good like how much capital do

555
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,659
you actually need understand these

556
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,939
business models more than you could

557
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,580
realize like one of those past slides

558
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,960
dopher san luis obispo or go for this

559
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,369
like how many people are there

560
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,160
population demographics like

561
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:18,419
transportation history like how hard is

562
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,060
it going to be to get building permits

563
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,890
or processes or licenses or permits like

564
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,720
this is a real struggle and if you go

565
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,540
into another country the most important

566
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,360
thing like if Salvador had a map and

567
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,279
like a paddle this is the key how do

568
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,599
their international their country laws

569
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,670
work with the international laws and

570
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,949
policies and then how could other

571
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,840
business models work there and if it's

572
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,940
not good if it's just cannabis and it's

573
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,919
special it's not going to be that

574
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,930
special like in the long run there so I

575
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,019
think that was about all I had

576
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,940
I like pandas a lot so I thought I'd put

577
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,009
that up there do you guys know that

578
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,190
pornography actually saved the panda

579
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,190
bear

580
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:58,748
I read a study this was like really in

581
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:01,358
the beginning of the month that they're

582
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:03,069
using animal panda porn like to like get

583
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:06,118
males males only like reproduce for two

584
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:07,928
days a year they're really lazy and I

585
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:10,208
learned about them when I was in Asia a

586
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:11,589
little bit so during that two days like

587
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,328
they have to be like amped up and the

588
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:15,638
population was going way down this one

589
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:17,440
Chinese doctors like how could I get

590
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:19,148
this to happen so you know we've got

591
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,769
unique problems pandas aren't

592
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:23,888
reproducing or you can't raise capital

593
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:26,440
or your business is failing you know get

594
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:27,819
creative you know to to keep the species

595
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:38,619
and keep the plant going alive

596
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:42,298
thank you all very very much check check

597
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:44,348
uh one more time for Nicky's Lee also

598
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:46,749
let's ask him some questions does

599
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:48,578
anybody have any questions all right

600
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:51,538
I'll start do you think it's better to

601
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:52,989
look domestically right now or to look

602
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,179
internationally and should you be

603
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:56,979
looking for small to invest in smaller

604
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:59,259
businesses or should you still try to be

605
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:05,798
in the big multi-million conglomerate

606
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:06,940
dollar game Capital comes from I think

607
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,408
that's really important where is your

608
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,399
money because that determines where

609
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:11,499
you're gonna be able to do this

610
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:14,978
sometimes there's residency requirements

611
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:16,629
so you know I like us things but I won't

612
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:18,999
take foreign national capital and invest

613
00:21:16,628 --> 00:21:20,769
into US companies breaking federal law I

614
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:22,598
don't think that's a good idea and I

615
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,209
don't like to use certain other capital

616
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:28,868
so like ancillary businesses or medical

617
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:31,119
cannabis or recreationally that's you

618
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:32,468
know if I was in California depending on

619
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:34,749
the amount of capital it's not just

620
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:37,479
giving another indoor grow but I think

621
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:39,129
that the internationals are harder to

622
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:40,088
get into they're more expensive and you

623
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:42,338
bleed in the beginning but they're gonna

624
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:44,259
be the huge hundred X plus multiples

625
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:46,868
that we really want US sides are like

626
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:48,759
your solid like ten to twenty s but some

627
00:21:46,868 --> 00:21:50,319
markets you get one of these new

628
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,058
licenses in one of these new states like

629
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,708
one of twelve or something if you can

630
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:56,648
scale that capitalize it and it's the

631
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:57,909
right state I think there's a super

632
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,138
super valuable but if you're

633
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:02,639
international you need a little bit more

634
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:04,628
money and patience and a lot of patience

635
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:06,579
thanks I got one more over here I just

636
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:08,779
have to walk

637
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:10,429
always wear comfortable shoes when you

638
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:12,559
go to these things it's always my advice

639
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:16,640
I don't know what sort of advice you

640
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,929
guys have hey Nick your talk a couple

641
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,640
years ago actually made me feel

642
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:25,730
comfortable to enter this industry so my

643
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,910
question is about your consolidation

644
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,500
slide using those comparable markets as

645
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,730
where we might be headed with national

646
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,930
legalization we've talked to a couple

647
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,690
regulatory attorneys about that to try

648
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:42,259
to guess where we're headed and we've

649
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:45,410
heard in general that it's not

650
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:48,980
necessarily correct to look at tobacco

651
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:51,320
and alcohol as a guide for how things

652
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,480
will go down because those were less

653
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,769
about state rights and cannabis has

654
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,480
really been pushed from the state

655
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:59,299
perspective so we're trying to

656
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,309
anticipate is the differentiation and

657
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:04,629
state regulation going to continue or

658
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:07,549
are we gonna end up with states all

659
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,620
headed in the similar direction and

660
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:12,139
we've sort of landed well as long as

661
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:13,699
it's a states rights thing then it'll

662
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,550
continue to be different state to state

663
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,140
yeah I would imagine it's gonna be a

664
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:19,909
combination of the two because we're too

665
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,290
lazy to legalize it federally because we

666
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,519
were the first we're the [ __ ] that

667
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,649
like made it illegal everywhere in the

668
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:27,289
world it's kind of like ooh we're not

669
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,090
gonna claim that one also we're gonna

670
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,769
Trump will protect US businesses when we

671
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:31,669
do this in it so it won't be one of

672
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:35,389
those models I think it'll be

673
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:37,100
comparative eventually though quickly

674
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,810
how alcoholic took forever to get

675
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:40,939
legalized this is happening very very

676
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,519
fast so the consolidation roll-up

677
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,740
strategy it's more of how it's gonna

678
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,299
happen because even if it is

679
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,029
state-by-state forever which though

680
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,169
there will be federal those still you

681
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:55,359
know business and Commerce we're going

682
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:57,710
to try to figure that one out I would I

683
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,939
would say this most important thing is

684
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,740
balance your books get everything ready

685
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,440
like audit ready financials do [ __ ]

686
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,670
correctly so when it comes time for some

687
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,759
sort of roll-up where those big

688
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,980
companies they were just too lazy and

689
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,599
big and risk adverse to come into it at

690
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,130
first they're gonna figure it out like

691
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,589
you already saw a constellation and

692
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,940
Altria and like all these others soon if

693
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:17,609
jewel has any money after all they're

694
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,360
man it's like

695
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:23,129
you know these companies coming in to

696
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,539
it'll happen I don't know how but being

697
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,490
prepared for it is what I've seen the

698
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:29,039
most important thing like how to roll up

699
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,750
that business proper valuations but do

700
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,099
it like an planet like a normal like

701
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,048
once you're done with your controller

702
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:35,279
actually get a CFO plan those things to

703
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,710
books everything ready and then

704
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,139
depending how you know that acquisition

705
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,429
could happen but you're right it is it's

706
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,840
different than before but it's gonna be

707
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,179
fast and it's the federal legalization

708
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,678
happens and international at the same

709
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,440
time will have to come on to it on a

710
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,580
medical side but the REC side yeah

711
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
that's a good question but it'll happen

712
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:55,829
one way or another

713
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,480
just be ready it's up Nick good

714
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:00,058
afternoon my name is Daniel with

715
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,620
cannabis Equity working group and my

716
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:03,690
question for you is are you comfortable

717
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:08,519
sharing with us your biggest win and

718
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:12,650
your biggest fail of 2019 2018 or 1919

719
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:15,210
it is 2020 biggest of 19 I had a

720
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,370
nepotism issue which sometimes like

721
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,410
nepotism is good like family members not

722
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:21,089
my family very small family and they're

723
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,070
just like a whole Nick's in the weed but

724
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,869
like this is like some partners of mine

725
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:26,730
were family and they'd been together for

726
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:29,849
a long time had a bunch of kids it was

727
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,279
like very small cap table epic epic

728
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:33,359
project they get a [ __ ] divorce where

729
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,918
she wants to leave him cuz he's a

730
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,229
horrible husband I've been working with

731
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:40,049
him for a year and I'm like oh [ __ ] this

732
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,130
[ __ ] just blew up and that's happened

733
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:42,750
I've seen in one way or another so to

734
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,360
use that example and not the specific

735
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,099
kind of country business project but you

736
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,808
got to really know like your people and

737
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,219
trust and you're building this like I

738
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:53,069
said bringing in new people bringing in

739
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,750
new trust is huge so failures and people

740
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:58,740
is probably like the biggest I'd say

741
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,640
deficit of 19 which I'm fixing but that

742
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,200
one's gonna be beautiful to a

743
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,460
cannibalistic I'm gonna fix that one

744
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,500
take that [ __ ] over now it's [ __ ]

745
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,509
awesome this is painful so it's kind of

746
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:11,880
like both in the same and best win of

747
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:13,289
nineteen oh I kind of came up with a

748
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,450
dual model with a few groups on some

749
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:17,700
international genetics and processes to

750
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,140
where some can produce the bananas and

751
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,130
some make the dried bananas kind of

752
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,780
thing

753
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,210
so those sorts of business models

754
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:26,220
long-term like genetics impact is really

755
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,200
really critical probably a win that not

756
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,940
realize this biggest I would like it now

757
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,029
but the long terms on that are just huge

758
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,400
and also well

759
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:35,649
hitting twenty billion last year you

760
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,910
know 20% of our country is legal for

761
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,560
adult use

762
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,300
that's kind of a big deal and now the

763
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,009
medical rights where we have three more

764
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,419
states at least get basic medical assume

765
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:46,029
biggest win there I think that we're

766
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,160
still still around and and also the

767
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,569
Canada finally like got exposed for the

768
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,070
lying [ __ ] that they were back in

769
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:53,740
april/may that was probably the biggest

770
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:54,700
win for the industry to I want to ask

771
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,220
when you say when you talk about

772
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,220
genetics being the next wave or whatnot

773
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,630
is that in terms of patenting them are

774
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,490
people gonna run into problems trying to

775
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,880
have proprietary is it all gonna remain

776
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,259
it's kind of somewhat open source for a

777
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,810
while for the most part there's always a

778
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:13,329
few proprietary outliers but what do you

779
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,559
think how many types of potatoes are

780
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,259
there in Peru is kind of like my

781
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,599
question of that right how many types of

782
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:21,190
potatoes will Monsanto let you grow well

783
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,779
not a good example currently and that

784
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,700
like a phosphate thing not that good of

785
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:27,879
an idea I'm at least on their breeding

786
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,600
side the US is very different than other

787
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,860
countries think about Driscoll's

788
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,539
breeders rights it's not about sometimes

789
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,219
owning the genetic it's like having

790
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:38,980
certain varieties and having licensing

791
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,690
agreements with offtake agreements for

792
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,789
said strawberry so like here I'm gonna

793
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,559
give you these strawberries for 8% you

794
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,970
can pay me and then I get first right of

795
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,379
refusal back on all your strawberries

796
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,509
I'm putting my little boxes but you're

797
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,860
like dirty and I'm gonna fight pests and

798
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:52,839
put up yellow sticky traps and like

799
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:55,419
greenhouses to grill my strawberries or

800
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,339
raspberries that's on an international

801
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,630
side breeders rights in the United

802
00:27:57,339 --> 00:28:00,730
States it's challenging because we think

803
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,170
my og cush are my cookies are my animal

804
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,809
cookies crossed with this blue dream

805
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:07,330
awesome like Kiev are straight and

806
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:09,909
variety they're awesome but when you get

807
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:11,139
deep down into it it's the API back to

808
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,240
pharmaceutical ingredients that are

809
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,980
important and even if it might bridey's

810
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,509
not as good as yours by the time you

811
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,430
extract it and put it into a product

812
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:19,000
other than certain concentrates it

813
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,920
doesn't matter

814
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,910
it's like certain constant like that's

815
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,630
we're getting to like this thing called

816
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,009
chemistry so it's yeah it's hard as hell

817
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:31,660
people don't go around being like I'm a

818
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:33,879
dank corn farmer and I love that side

819
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,320
and like that's I that that that's where

820
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,500
it all came from but the sad thing is a

821
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:39,490
lot of people are gonna get just screwed

822
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,660
long term when it comes to growing

823
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,579
certain varieties that they had

824
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,529
licensing agreement with but in the u.s.

825
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:44,929
variety spreads so so quickly it's so

826
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,460
hard

827
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,529
keep a little cutting or tissue culture

828
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,090
so I think for most individuals they

829
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,559
want two problems for using it it's just

830
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:52,789
for the big things where they're pulling

831
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,379
out specific things that those

832
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,269
protections are really valuable

833
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,740
yeah the [ __ ] is already protected

834
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:02,500
that already but the plants everywhere

835
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:04,910
now so it's alright more questions

836
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,509
that's it here's educator did you want

837
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:10,310
to be on this particular subject it's a

838
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:12,049
big landscape out there I've seen a lot

839
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:13,129
but no matter what you're doing in the

840
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,109
space it matters this is

841
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,520
once-in-a-lifetime we can create an

842
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:19,729
industry that matters that people care

843
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,400
about and it can be impactful and super

844
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,900
profitable but it's not just these

845
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,430
buzzwords anymore that you can follow

846
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,710
behind and think you're gonna have a CBD

847
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,350
company and take over the world like

848
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,180
that was really fun but like the more

849
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:34,099
unique ones we keep seeing like it's

850
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,360
barely begun and it's gonna be huge it's

851
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:37,730
just most of the people it's like the

852
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,079
curve of dissolution right now like same

853
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,819
thing with the stock market tech was

854
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,799
cool tech got really cool but no one

855
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:44,149
actually did [ __ ] all the things crashed

856
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,299
who did survive like we're on that

857
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,890
downward but it's City on a curve though

858
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,109
it's getting larger like the volume

859
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,940
demand so it's just it's this moment

860
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:54,500
where if you can figure out what's gonna

861
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,110
survive and what's gonna be real it's

862
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,220
not some new IP tracking software for

863
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:01,129
plants like there's this thing called

864
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,600
agate has that already so or it's not

865
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,760
like some blockchain we're gonna do seed

866
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,839
to sale like it should exist in all

867
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,759
these other markets so they're just

868
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,500
gonna buy the winners scale into that

869
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,269
and use when you have a problem outside

870
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,650
industry solutions and cater them for

871
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:14,210
this you don't have to buy a thirty

872
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,910
thousand dollar bucking machine you can

873
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:19,250
cut some you know steel like food grid

874
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:21,620
and like shut through it depending but

875
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,349
yeah there's a lot of opportunities to

876
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:25,699
stay diligent and know the rules I think

877
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:27,159
that's the most important thing I could

878
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,289
leave you with the compliance side

879
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,970
otherwise your businesses will fail and

880
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,349
never happened so really appreciate the

881
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:37,670
opportunity to share fresh back from

882
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:39,559
