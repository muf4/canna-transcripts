00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:16,900
this cannabis thing sometimes a

49
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,219
four-letter word known as compliance

50
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,680
which is important to be proactive

51
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:22,000
rather than reactive about so I'm here

experience looks like what it looks like

54
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,159
to unpack that buzzword of compliance

55
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,379

56
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,389

00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:43,279

116
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,659
working in Sacramento so working very

117
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:19,209
closely with state departments and

118
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,650
legislative officials in terms of

119
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:24,109
getting the situation we're in figured

120
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:26,329
out my side with the business

121
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,430
development obviously work on a lot of

122
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:30,529
our strategic partnerships offering you

them the education that they need to

126
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,399
survive in the industry that it's

127
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,890
California right on thank you and thank

128
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:47,029
you for being here I think that we

129
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,979
realize that the success were relative

130
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:53,149
failures of each of our opportunities

131
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:56,180
our business often rests on who we

132
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:59,750
choose as a strategic partner and how we

133
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,699
go about forming that partnership I've

134
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,529
looked around a lot of folks are suing

135
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,930
each other and it seems to boil down to

136
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,479
two things who you chose as a partner

137
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,090
and what that contract looked like but

138
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,230
what is a partner that's a very broad

139
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:16,819
word broad term strategic partnership so

140
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,620
first I just want to explore with you

141
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,629
guys real quick because each of you come

142
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,689
from a different aspect of the industry

143
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,670
what types of strategic partnerships you

144
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:27,290
come across and what you're looking for

145
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,520
in those partnerships how do you vet

146
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,520
them I'll start here

147
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,689
so since we have a expansive catalog of

148
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,910
about 4,000 products some of them are

149
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:40,370
in-house and others are obviously with

150
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,400
partnerships so I deal with the partners

151
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,079
every single day my business is based on

152
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,019
dealing with true strategic partnerships

153
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:51,740
I can't operate my business without

154
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:53,389
partnerships after all so for me the

155
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,120
biggest thing in a strategic partnership

156
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,539
is sort of being like upfront and honest

157
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,759
in the beginning if you're looking to be

158
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,590
doing business for longevity to me if

159
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,689
anything you're hiding or leaving off

160
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,299
the table will be exposed in the long

161
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:10,699
run so I think if you're able to just

162
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,410
whatever makes you think you're hiding

163
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,149
something or you're uncomfortable I lay

164
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,710
it out because like it usually it's not

165
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:16,819
as big of a deal as you think and if you

166
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,669
lay it out in the beginning and you can

167
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:22,370
iron those details out and honestly

168
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,780
before you move forward it's easier at

169
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,280
that point rather than setting

170
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,919
expectations in a way that you're

171
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,109
leading someone on kind of and then

172
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,699
you're just asking for disaster at that

173
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,020
point and that's why someone's going to

174
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:34,819
sue you and that's why they're not gonna

175
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,129
have a conversation with you to fix

176
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,469
things because you led them on in in a

177
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,879
demeanor that wasn't honest at the end

178
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,740
of the day so I think for me the biggest

179
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,810
thing in strategic partnerships is being

180
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,370
upfront and laying it out on the line in

181
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,220
the beginning rather than trying to act

182
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,660
like you're something that you're not

183
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,070
yeah so be clear about what you're gonna

184
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,770
do but also be clear about what you're

185
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:56,480
not gonna do right up front yeah mark

186
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,219
yeah I know that's that's great

187
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,129
I mean without integrity nothing works

188
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,510
right so says the compliance guy how

189
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,959
many of you guys get more time in this

190
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,789
industry I didn't think so I always say

191
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,009
you don't get more time you get more

192
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,750
team for me that's what strategic

193
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,430
partnerships are all about there are

194
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,350
things that he's going to be good at and

195
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,449
loves to do that I'm not good at and

196
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,760
don't love to do but with more people

197
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,819
around me to basically supplement and

198
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,550
align vision the more can be done in a

199
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,110
way that actually works and so I'm a

200
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,759
firm believer that if you share the same

201
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,680
vision everything else is a conversation

202
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,870
for workability how do we achieve that

203
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,210
vision how do we set those goals how do

204
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,560
we make that happen so we have somebody

205
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,629
new that comes to us for example and

206
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,159
says hey I want to be taking my

207
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:42,600
compliance to the next level I know I

208
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,639
have gaps in it I know I could do better

209
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,170
that's sort of what we need to hear and

210
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,610
see and understand in any sort of

211
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,709
strategic partnership where I'm gonna

212
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,450
put my time forward so I'm not really

213
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,940
here to waste anybody's money or my time

214
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,440
right we don't get a lot more of that

215
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,840
but with strategic partnerships you

216
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,860
actually expand both of those things so

217
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
I like to thinking about it from that

218
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,610
perspective how do we put integrity in

219
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,050
place how do we set expectations at a

220
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,360
real honest upfront manner

221
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,469
absolutely but also how do we surround

222
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,539
ourselves with people that share our

223
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,210
same vision and are willing to put in

224
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,459
the work to respect each other and to

225
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,139
create something that's bigger than each

226
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,580
of you individually and I think that's

227
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,669
what strategic partnerships are all

228
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,629
about for me you're about to jump out of

229
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,629
your chair you want to go next

230
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:33,649
of course Rocco's always good for a

231
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:37,110
comment that's why I knew I could yes

232
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,759
well you know I'm navigating I quickly

233
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,590
went from the young guy in the room to

234
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,350
the old man in the cave and I'm still

235
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,889
trying to figure that out but you know

236
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:51,300
with with that 30-plus years in in

237
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:54,990
business comes a lot of wisdom and you

238
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,819
know I I'm about two years into cannabis

239
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,560
and risk management after about thirty

240
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,520
four years in automotive components

241
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,049
manufacturing where I did informed and

242
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,960
work with partnerships all over the

243
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:10,709
world so have a pretty good perspective

244
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,820
of what worked and what didn't and it

245
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:17,879
really comes down to a good partner is

246
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,370
going to believe your vision they're

247
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,100
going to share your mission and they're

248
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,179
gonna live your core values everything

249
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,580
else is secondary because I mean they're

250
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,199
I have been involved in situations where

251
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,150
there were technical reasons there were

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,370
Geographic reasons there were logistic

253
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:37,529
reasons to form these partnerships but

254
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,139
they were all trumped by particularly

255
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,459
the core values side so anybody that's

256
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,110
in the business starting the business

257
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,330
new in the business or been in the

258
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,659
business for some time if you don't have

259
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,160
a vision if you don't have a set mission

260
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:52,899
statement and if you don't have a set of

261
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,629
core values the trumps everything you do

262
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,100
in your business I suggest you get them

263
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,679
because those are really gonna form the

264
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,029
criteria for the partnerships that you

265
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,519
for going forward

266
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,740
Rocco that's so well said and I would

267
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,809
dare say that that applies to every

268
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,639
relationship in our life most of which

269
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:11,859
are strategic whether it be personal or

270
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,379
professional so well stated yeah

271
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,769
Justin so so without repeating that the

272
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:20,320
mark and Rocco definitely highlighted

273
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,059
you know businesses you it's difficult

274
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,400
to be successful in business if you

275
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:26,679
don't have partnerships you're going to

276
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,379
have partners external partnerships in

277
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,359
this industry it seems like it's almost

278
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,970
essential to have internal partnerships

279
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,279
as well many of you are looking for

280
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,899
investment many of you are investing so

281
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,319
many of you need knowledge many of you

282
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:43,709
need investment that's it's a it's a

283
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:49,150
tricky it can be a tricky combination

284
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:52,090
but but definitely choosing the right

285
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:55,620
individuals is absolutely with the right

286
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:58,060
skill sets is absolutely important

287
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,830
successful businesses have many

288
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,359
different leadership styles there's many

289
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,210
responsibilities and you need to have

290
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,340
those people that are sharing the

291
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,740
various skill sets and complementing one

292
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,480
another and sharing the same vision and

293
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:15,310
and subscribing to the values as well

294
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,110
Justin it's obviously hard to elaborate

295
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:19,959
off of what they talked about but for me

296
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,850
it's it's it's clear value add for our

297
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,220
members is this going to be a

298
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,100
partnership that benefits our membership

299
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,990
base and why and then you know so

300
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,090
finding those areas are obviously

301
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,250
important and then once you find those

302
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,540
areas find people that align you know

303
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,850
our mission statement is our guiding

304
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,649
principles for everything we do so if

305
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,170
we're partnering with people they don't

306
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,929
align with that that's when things tend

307
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:45,549
to get messy so really you know

308
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,679
partnering with people that you know

309
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,899
it's not necessarily just a win-win for

310
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,519
me and whoever the partner was but I

311
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,909
look for partners who were doing you

312
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,860
know

313
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:56,649
in their community you know having more

314
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,120
of a broad sort of benefit you know as a

315
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,899
non-profit trade association is

316
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,840
definitely something we look for yeah

317
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,610
this is you know strategic relationship

318
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,110
strategic partnerships are often a

319
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,240
little bit like love you fall in love

320
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,740
with what you think that person can do

321
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,169
for your business or what you think that

322
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,149
business can do for your business and we

323
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,129
all know fools rush in yeah you think oh

324
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,049
this is a great idea and we can build

325
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:24,789
this business together but then the

326
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:27,959
failure to clearly articulate whose role

327
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:31,360
is what and finding people that not only

328
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,190
complement but in some cases fill those

329
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,870
gaps that you actually are not good at

330
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,670
the same things and don't think alike

331
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,750
because that can strengthen your

332
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:43,419
business if the core values are the same

333
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,879
so as much as we can all talk about that

334
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:48,909
perfect relationship that we always seek

335
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:54,700
how do you triangulate that that

336
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:56,980
relationship is who they say they are if

337
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,810
what you said just resonated with me

338
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,250
because there was many years in our

339
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,069
company we were three offices

340
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,750
coast-to-coast we had 20 employees and a

341
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,550
lot of our strategy was well let's just

342
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,200
get people to realize how not compliant

343
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:10,269
they are and we would call and say do

344
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,009
you have these SOPs and you have this or

345
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:13,569
do you have that and what I didn't

346
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:15,460
realize was we weren't really putting

347
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,560
our core values out there to be shared

348
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,300
in a way that aligned and what we got

349
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:22,029
were a lot of people that reacted to

350
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,679
non-compliance right rather than finding

351
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,569
that three or five percent of the

352
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,579
industry the select few out there that

353
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,350
wanted to be proactive about compliance

354
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,970
management and be in a position where

355
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,740
they could be proud about their

356
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,950
compliance and say that we can stand by

357
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,799
it

358
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,080
then so that was a very expensive lesson

359
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,269
to learn that if you don't vet it out or

360
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,040
you're not a stand for the values that

361
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,509
you say you are in the world you're just

362
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,399
gonna attract the wrong thing instead

363
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,429
there's something to the integrity of

364
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,350
yourself to in finding out who to

365
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:55,750
partner with or who to vet and how you

366
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:57,610
work with them absolutely there you

367
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,610
don't always necessarily know why but

368
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,100
your subconscious does Rocco and much of

369
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,450
this responsibility really falls on the

370
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,019
show

371
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:09,240
of leadership you know as a leader it's

372
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,509
important to really strive for clarity

373
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,750
and alignment and and to force

374
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:18,029
situations that where those things can

375
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,610
be measured I mean I have like I said

376
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:23,909
have been around a long time and I have

377
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,730
what I fondly call Rocco's ten rules of

378
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:29,339
business and and one of them is what

379
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,560
gets what gets measured gets done so you

380
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,870
have to find a way to quantify but

381
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,459
before you can quantify again to get

382
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,639
back in front of that it's really the

383
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:42,000
clarity issue because you know you can't

384
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,799
just as the other panel members were

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,629
saying I mean you can't just say these

386
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,189
are my core values you have to quantify

387
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:51,330
those core values and you have to be

388
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:53,040
very clear and the best way to to show

389
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:56,070
people you're clear is is through

390
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,459
demonstration not through instruction so

391
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,550
that that's that's key and and set that

392
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,139
bar high set that you only get one shot

393
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:08,250
you only get one shot so when you get a

394
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:09,990
chance to set that bar set it high yeah

395
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,259
I don't know the answer as far as how to

396
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,879
vet people because it's oftentimes it

397
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:17,490
can be trial and error but having a very

398
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,009
good operating agreement up front

399
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:23,700
especially in a joint venture is

400
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:26,069
absolutely imperative you definitely

401
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,640
want to hire a lawyer don't don't do

402
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,400
anything off of LegalZoom or copying and

403
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,019
pasting a word template off the internet

404
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,360
when you're doing that because they're

405
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,990
they have the expertise to go through

406
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,810
all the what-ifs with you and then get

407
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,360
those written down in detail of how how

408
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:48,959
are we gonna handle this if this happens

409
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,050
and remember to hire slowly fire fast

410
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,879
yes fail quickly excellent advice and

411
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:56,729
you bring up an important point because

412
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,019
you know in in a marriage you take vows

413
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,230
and let's hope you're not bowing

414
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,090
something that you know you're not gonna

415
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,470
stick to but when you're entering into a

416
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,449
business you also have to make vows that

417
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,279
these are the things that I am going to

418
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,750
do in this partnership this is my

419
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,209
statement of work what I'm responsible

420
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,119
for I also strongly recommend that you

421
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,400
state what you in two

422
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,918
to fail at meaning this is what I'm not

423
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,630
gonna do because that's where the gaps

424
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,980
often fall is oh I thought you were

425
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,449
gonna do it you thought I was gonna do

426
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,939
it will screw you we're going to court

427
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:30,409
and that brings me to the prenup right

428
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:32,090
the exit strategy I found when entering

429
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:34,340
into strategic partnerships that

430
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:37,399
envisioning the exit is the best way to

431
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:40,849
get to the agreement where and how is

432
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,340
this going to either sell or dissolve or

433
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:45,558
achieve its goal whatever that it is and

434
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:47,569
then work backwards from there and I

435
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:50,210
love for some of you to speak to that -

436
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:51,408
how do you envision the exit strategy

437
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,058
with respect to your strategic

438
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:58,100
partnerships for me honestly in a lot of

439
00:17:56,058 --> 00:18:00,408
our partnerships I think I scare away

440
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:02,449
some partnerships in the early on stage

441
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,770
because I go straight to that end stage

442
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,750
with people right away or at least

443
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:08,210
discuss it I said well what are we

444
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,769
talking about four five years down the

445
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,480
long 10 years down the line how long are

446
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,069
you online how long you committing to me

447
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,778
are you two years are you in this for

448
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:16,639
five years are you selling in two years

449
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:18,769
you need to ask those questions upfront

450
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,270
to really see what the partnership is

451
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:21,889
gonna be you might have one idea of

452
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:23,569
where this partnerships going and their

453
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,220
idea is a completely different thing and

454
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,898
you might start off and everything's

455
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,819
great but then where you're going or

456
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:30,769
it's different and that's a big problem

457
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,970
so I think like it's okay to scare

458
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,788
someone away because that just means

459
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,558
it's not going to work out so just be

460
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:38,869
straight again upfront and honest of

461
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,808
where you're going with things to let

462
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:44,509
people out you know and I like to take a

463
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:46,158
different slant and again it's not

464
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:49,759
always successful I'm not claiming that

465
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:51,860
it is but I like to what I call create

466
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,230
the Hotel California situation with

467
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:56,889
partnerships you know you can check out

468
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,349
anytime you like but you can never leave

469
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:03,679
it's it's it's truly you know I like to

470
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:06,408
make them perpetual because you should

471
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,850
always be looking for a reason that you

472
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,409
want your partner to stay and your

473
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:11,389
partner should always be giving you a

474
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:14,360
reason that they want to stay and vice

475
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,909
versa so so it's always about creating

476
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,859
value and and you know it when you get

477
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,380
into a partnership it's no longer all

478
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:23,519
about you so you have to spend a lot of

479
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,100
time and effort in the value

480
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,190
the value proposition if your partner as

481
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:31,889
well as you but you know I don't spend a

482
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,679
lot of time on predetermined action

483
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,900
strategies or termination clauses or

484
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,110
periods of time I'd like to spend the

485
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,570
time and effort on the evolution of a

486
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:45,479
partnership that'll that'll last or

487
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:48,689
outlast the business and I think there's

488
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,460
a combination of the two there that some

489
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,900
people can find success in did you want

490
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,740
to say something on the end jasmine yeah

491
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,240
definitely

492
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,380
just make sure that the relationship

493
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,769
that you have with your strategic

494
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,960
partner the alignment of the mission

495
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,240
statement that is with the business and

496
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,819
not the person because that we've all

497
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,000
seen in this industry people move around

498
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:14,159
often I've worked on partnerships with

499
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,058
somebody for three months and then give

500
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,240
them a call back and they're no longer

501
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:22,200
there so definitely making sure that you

502
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,669
know everything is clearly obviously but

503
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,440
yeah definitely make sure that the

504
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,630
partnership is with the actual business

505
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,240
and not just a contact that you have a

506
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,070
great point absolute great point yeah

507
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,500
because so many people form partnerships

508
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:36,089
because it's it's in part a personal

509
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,250
relationship with the player and then

510
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:39,689
when that player doesn't show up at the

511
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,400
play first base that day and then

512
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,080
they're stuck because they realize it

513
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,370
wasn't with the business especially in

514
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,500
this industry right now I mean people

515
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,808
are moving so fast we have to try to

516
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,390
keep our database clean and it's it's a

517
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:53,730
it's a full-time job almost just with

518
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,940
how much different movement is happening

519
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,558
so if I ever clean out my shoe boxes of

520
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,410
your business cards I have your entire

521
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,298
work histories I know you say the other

522
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,660
point is get to know veterans who know

523
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:05,460
people

524
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,500
because usually somebody knows somebody

525
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,179
in this industry and there's either

526
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,710
gonna be a reputation that's positive

527
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,298
and you can count on that person being

528
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,980
there in the future or there's one

529
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,509
that's maybe not so positive and I think

530
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,980
it's important to ask the peers that are

531
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,869
in respected leadership positions

532
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,669
whether you should be forming strategic

533
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:22,529
partners with certain people because

534
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,299
it's taken a sweat blood and tears to

535
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:26,099
build what we have as brands and

536
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:28,079
reputation which are things people can't

537
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,389
take away but they're also double-edged

538
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,849
swords that can easily cut you if you

539
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,620
hand somebody that in trust right and

540
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:35,459
they turn it against you or it's used in

541
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,459
a way that

542
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,759
that really is detrimental rather than

543
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,038
sort of adding value at all yeah and

544
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,048
remember I mean because I mean we're

545
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,990
doing it then at the NC RMA I mean our

546
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:51,839
risk management platform is is so broad

547
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,250
that the vast majority of the risk

548
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,609
management services that we're offering

549
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,679
are through service partners one thing

550
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:59,819
to keep clearly in mind I mean you spend

551
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,450
a lot of time and money and effort

552
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,950
creating and protecting your brand as

553
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,500
soon as you bring a service partner on

554
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,419
board that person has to or that company

555
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,940
has to have the same obligation because

556
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:14,220
they become part of your brand there's

557
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,350
no separation at that point you're my

558
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,750
service partner and you do something

559
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:22,019
wrong that reflects badly on the brand

560
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:24,480
of the NCR mayor whatever business we're

561
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,250
talking about and it takes a certain

562
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,690
level of commitment as a partner to be

563
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,849
able to say I'm gonna be here for you

564
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,980
and that and I tell people we for

565
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:34,048
example my company we we take that stand

566
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,880
integrity excellence leadership our core

567
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:38,190
values and we're not here to make a

568
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,230
one-time checkbox happen and say you're

569
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,600
compliant compliance is for example an

570
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,339
ongoing continual process of continued

571
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,678
improvement it's not something that just

572
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,449
magically happens overnight so that's

573
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,460
that's at least a year-long agreement

574
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,740
with with our clients if not 2 to 5

575
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,100
because if you're the front you own that

576
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,829
partnership I mean there's no there's no

577
00:22:55,099 --> 00:23:02,428
sidestepping the fact well you know if

578
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:04,109
you act in in for my benefit with my

579
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:07,259
members and you don't perform that's

580
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:09,298
just like me not performing indeed and I

581
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,669
think it's important to as you look to

582
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:15,569
these strategic relationships that you

583
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:17,700
find alignment in that the goal helps

584
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:19,829
the people involved do better the

585
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,080
agreement itself the partnership the

586
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:24,418
relationship has to raise all ships or

587
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,879
one of the partners is always getting

588
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,009
screwed or doing more work or wanting to

589
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,559
find a way out or find a way around and

590
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:32,490
so some of the more successful

591
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,379
relationships I've seen aren't people

592
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,769
that even necessarily like each other

593
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,000
but they have aligned common goals and

594
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:43,349
they have

595
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,940
a similar work ethic that when one wins

596
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:46,619
the other one wins and I think that

597
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,590
those are some of the most successful

598
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:52,169
long-term relationships I'm curious

599
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:54,449
because we all can talk about what to do

600
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:57,330
I want to hear what not to do and you

601
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,069
started tiptoeing down into this not

602
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:01,679
only is this the more interesting and

603
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:03,539
juicy topic of conversation but at

604
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,250
Oaksterdam we're big fans of not just

605
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,409
setting you up for success but preparing

606
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,500
you for the worst there are a lot of

607
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:12,930
potholes on the road to legalization and

608
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,710
regulation and you're likely to step in

609
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:20,340
one so how do you become a better

610
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:23,309
[ __ ] detector and what made you a

611
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:27,199
better one what terrible things are you

612
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:29,579
hoping they don't accidentally do I

613
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,470
think it's a comes in to management

614
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,569
styles for me at least I'm very tight

615
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,130
loose tight I will set the expectations

616
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:37,139
up front and let people know exactly

617
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,180
what I need how I need it and what I'll

618
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,830
do for them in return then it's a game

619
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,600
of integrity right showing up with your

620
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:44,189
word and actually doing it because you

621
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,389
said you would but I also give that

622
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,250
freedom and space for another

623
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,290
conversation to happen for things to

624
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,029
happen for business to happen with the

625
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,859
commitment of just trust respect in

626
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:56,009
place right because you have to allow

627
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,929
for people to show up and for people to

628
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:59,369
lift you up instead of tear you down or

629
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,410
whatever else they could end up doing

630
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:03,329
and it's in that loose space that I

631
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,890
often find that I'm discerning most

632
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:06,990
whether or not this is going to be a

633
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,430
valuable strategic partner and at that

634
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,079
point you can then come back to that

635
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,759
tight on the other end of that tight

636
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,099
loose tight and hold them accountable

637
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,259
and my world accountability is love

638
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:18,299
that's how I want to make sure my

639
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,680
clients are gonna be successful right

640
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,359
because they have accountability

641
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,789
transparency and integrity in their

642
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,069
business so for me that's that's kind of

643
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:28,559
how we like to operate this baby will at

644
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:30,359
least create sort of a structure that we

645
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,740
can figure that out we can do that dance

646
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,079
and figure out whether or not that

647
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,579
strategic partner is going to be a waste

648
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,289
of each other's time and money and not

649
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,179
be successful and it's much easier to

650
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:42,269
break up at that point or if you really

651
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,130
can show up on the other end of that and

652
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:46,410
take responsibility

653
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,970
just say you know maybe this isn't the

654
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,850
right time but I want to be your friend

655
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,910
let's wait until certain things happen

656
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:57,959
yeah Justin you see a lot of strategic

657
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:59,960
partnerships within the CCIA and I'd

658
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,880
love to hear a little bit and then go to

659
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,590
Justin Bo ta right after my Justin's on

660
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,410
the end yeah I mean we touched on this a

661
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:10,169
little bit but seeing partnerships be

662
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:13,380
formed without the right documentation

663
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:16,320
is really really bad obviously when I

664
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,010
was new with this you know I formed a

665
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,539
partnership for an event with a person

666
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:24,690
the deliverables on both sides weren't

667
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:29,789
clear and the MOU slipped things like

668
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:33,360
that and then you know the whole program

669
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:35,579
whatever it is so obviously learned the

670
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,009
hard way that way and then just really

671
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,599
making sure yeah

672
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:40,980
that you know that their side of things

673
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,599
because you could be very clear with

674
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,539
what you want out of the partnership but

675
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,299
really making sure that you're clear on

676
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,970
what they want out of it to be able to

677
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,460
you know not just work for six months

678
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,350
but work for three to five years because

679
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,730
when it's very clear on both sides

680
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:58,109
people are I mean yeah you don't

681
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,410
necessarily have to like each other but

682
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:03,359
you're you're invested you know a little

683
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,790
bit deeper level than just a business

684
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:09,179
perspective when you truly care about

685
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:14,700
what you're doing and that that slips a

686
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:15,060
lot too so my experience as far as this

687
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,400
goes

688
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:21,659
often comes from the investor operator

689
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,430
relationship there's the the person with

690
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,350
the money and there's the person with

691
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,210
the knowledge and oftentimes the people

692
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:29,490
with the knowledge leave with the money

693
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,930
and the people with the money leave with

694
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,920
the knowledge I don't know if you've

695
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,500
heard that one before

696
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,120
so it's very important that as an

697
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:41,579
investor you stay active in the business

698
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:43,439
you you you get a you get a hold of the

699
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:45,809
bookkeeping maybe cloudbase book and

700
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,850
you're always staying diligent as far as

701
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:49,259
how the expenditures are going you want

702
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:52,439
to make sure that the policies and

703
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:54,839
procedures are going correct again

704
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,029
there's people with different skill sets

705
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,789
that should be being employed in

706
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:02,220
good a successful business there's the

707
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:05,819
people who do our systems oriented

708
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,339
there's the visionary there's the person

709
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:11,460
who deals with the employees and and is

710
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:14,519
it facilitates um you want all of those

711
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,289
things going well and as an investor you

712
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,450
want to stay involved in that to make

713
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:21,180
sure that your money is is being spent

714
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,830
properly and then the one thing that I

715
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,570
the big thing that I like to warn people

716
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:26,849
about especially from an investor

717
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:28,950
perspective is oftentimes this is

718
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:29,609
totally like kind of going off in a

719
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,559
different direction

720
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:34,319
but if you're considering buying a

721
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:36,329
business or you got a I'll always take

722
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:40,859
into consideration the tax ramifications

723
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:42,059
of that yeah because because like people

724
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,619
think that like maybe buying a

725
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,720
dispensary is a really great idea

726
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:47,909
because it looks profitable on a cash

727
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,850
flow but just wait until that - return

728
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,620
gets done it's really bad bad stuff yeah

729
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:54,809
before you enter into any relationship

730
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,479
with anyone or any entity there are

731
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:59,309
several tax organizations that you're

732
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,990
gonna want to double-check their history

733
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:03,480
because you could be getting into bed

734
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,140
with someone that did not understand

735
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,920
280e

736
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:11,009
and now you are marrying into their tax

737
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,039
liabilities Rocco you know another

738
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:17,369
another point when considering a

739
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:19,289
partnership because many times when when

740
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:21,929
we consider partners I mean we approach

741
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:24,809
it very much like we're hiring key

742
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:27,390
employees or hiring employees so so a

743
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:31,470
danger is i mean don't don't focus only

744
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:34,830
on the cognitive because i mean like

745
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:38,190
many of us guilty of it for years until

746
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:41,279
i discovered the true value of talent

747
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,980
optimization but like many of us you

748
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,359
know we when we hire somebody we we

749
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,069
interview them and we ask them the

750
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,389
technical questions and we look at their

751
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:50,849
resume we check their reverence

752
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,310
references and all the cognitive skills

753
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:56,279
are there but but the relationship

754
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:58,109
doesn't work out because of you know the

755
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,359
behavioral side and we don't take the

756
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:02,699
time and effort or implement the tools

757
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,039
that we need to properly evaluate the

758
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,779
the behavioral side I mean it's like you

759
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,000
know we're hired for what we know and

760
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,240
we're fired for who we are so it's

761
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,558
equally important from a

762
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,558
partner standpoint you need to

763
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:16,660
understand not only the the cognitive

764
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,428
skill set of your partnership but also

765
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,929
the behavior skill set because that's

766
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,809
where it goes south I mean how many

767
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:25,330
times has a partnership truly gone south

768
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:27,879
because the person or the company that

769
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:30,428
you partnered with didn't know what you

770
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,230
thought they know very seldom because

771
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,179
that's what we vet what we don't fit is

772
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,769
how they behave what's important how

773
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:38,070
they're motivated how they think how

774
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:40,750
dominant they are how they communicate

775
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:42,189
patience our impatience formality so

776
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,009
that's an area that I think we have to

777
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:48,450
spend much more time in in developing

778
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:51,250
partnerships that do become perpetual I

779
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,259
was just gonna say don't be fooled by by

780
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,359
perception and you should fact check

781
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:57,549
because sometimes you can lead into what

782
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,979
people are saying and want to believe it

783
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,750
and that want to believe leads you to

784
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,089
believe it rather than actually doing

785
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,339
your homework and taking out the books

786
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:10,149
and whatever factual evidence you need

787
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:12,159
to make the right choice well thank you

788
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,600
for that segue because I would add to

789
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,820
everything that you said educate

790
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,069
yourself you know do the homework to not

791
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:21,159
just know your business but their

792
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:23,019
business know just enough to know what

793
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,450
keeps them up at night what are their

794
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:27,339
goals and responsibilities in that

795
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,539
strategic partnership I try to explain

796
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:30,009
to folks well I'm just going into the

797
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,769
business of cannabis I'm just going to

798
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:35,650
be ancillary or just just just yes but

799
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:37,779
you have to know what the growers are

800
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,880
dealing with what the patient's are

801
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:42,339
dealing with in order to be truly the

802
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,190
best dispensary including your bottom

803
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:48,779
line so educating yourself on the entire

804
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:50,890
supply chain but also the rights and

805
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:54,149
responsibilities is this person a

806
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,900
fiduciary does this person have other

807
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:59,790
responsibilities that you need to be

808
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:02,110
aware of that might involve agencies

809
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:04,240
where they're forced into certain

810
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:07,058
behavior because that's what's required

811
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,380
of them that you might not understand or

812
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:13,089
expect as a Candace can a business owner

take a stab at it

823
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,970
so I got into this because I'm

824
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,400
passionate about what Candice cannabis

825
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,440
can do for people and in ending right

826
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,090
the war on drugs and sort of the world

827
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,789
of the advocacy side of things like you

828
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:04,500
did Dale back in the day right so

829
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:06,569
there's a much bigger thing than me even

830
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,250
involved here we just do the most boring

831
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,740
non sexy thing a marijuana called

832
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,119
compliance because it's a stand for

833
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,339
integrity and transparency and

834
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,329
professionalism in our industry so it

835
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,220
keeps me up at night is that we're in

836
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:19,199
this very unique in each position in

837
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,269
which we deal with the investor and the

838
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,519
white-collar sort of world of things and

839
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:25,500
I don't just mean that figuratively

840
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,150
they're mostly like rich white men and

841
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,680
then there's the other side of it which

842
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,750
is the cannabis industry where people

843
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,279
came from for a lot of years going

844
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,650
through the war on drugs and the war

845
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,970
against cannabis and I think what keeps

846
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,460
me up at night is trying to get those

847
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,100
two worlds to really understand and

848
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,019
speak the same language and be able to

849
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:44,669
communicate their sets of expectations

850
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:46,650
to each other so that their strategic

851
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,990
partnerships can work because we

852
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:53,280
actually need both for this thing to

853
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:56,339
become what it can become and so as a

854
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:00,000
compliance person I often think and

855
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:01,589
worry about sort of what can we do with

856
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,269
regard to social equity I said on

857
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:04,980
national cannabis industry associations

858
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:06,869
equity diversity inclusion committee

859
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,210
being half Brazilian myself doing a lot

860
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:10,859
of work in Latin America how can we

861
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,630
raise other countries up that have been

862
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,820
most impacted by the war on drugs so

863
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,369
some of these are what I'm looking for

864
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,050
strategic partners when it comes to

865
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:22,710
aligning values and what you're really

866
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:26,010
up to but also how can compliance become

867
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:28,500
the dictionary thesaurus the translator

868
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:31,020
between those two worlds and create that

869
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,668
level of accountability and integrity

870
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:33,119
that both sides need to be able to have

871
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:35,429
with a

872
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,079
and sometimes that's the only language

873
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,000
is the one written for attorneys by

874
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,440
attorneys that we then need to translate

875
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,329
throughout the rest of the organization

876
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,860
and get into place in a way that is

877
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:47,400
going to make those strategic partners

878
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,200
work right in that business grow I love

879
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,910
that you are reminding us all to be

880
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:57,329
thoughtful about who we look for to

881
00:34:53,909 --> 00:35:00,509
partner that it sometimes takes a moment

882
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:04,259
longer to look a little harder to find a

883
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:06,420
veteran a person of color a woman I'm

884
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,410
married to a white guy I have two young

885
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,780
sons and a daughter

886
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:12,960
I hope one of them gets turns into a

887
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,840
rich white white guy someday but it's

888
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,940
about seeking out the not obvious

889
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,950
opportunities and often these are going

890
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,369
to be your best relationships for sure

891
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:25,589
Rocco you know strictly from a

892
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,779
professional and from a risk management

893
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:32,880
perspective what I find most challenging

894
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,860
in in tackling this you know this

895
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,550
elephant in the room is they're

896
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:41,309
different from other industries of which

897
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,480
I've played that many of us have played

898
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:44,940
that they're much more traditional

899
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,829
there's really two types of risk in

900
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,570
cannabis there and we were talking about

901
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:50,849
this in the green room there's the

902
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:54,090
internal risk which is the risk that is

903
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:57,659
truly inherent in owning and operating a

904
00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:00,870
cannabis business but then much much and

905
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:03,480
if it was just simply left at that we'd

906
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,969
have the problem solved but but the real

907
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,980
problem comes in is is differentiating

908
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:10,649
and defining the external risk and

909
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,300
that's all the risk that is inflicted on

910
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,450
the cannabis business owner because

911
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:19,769
they've chosen cannabis as a way to make

912
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:22,889
a living and we need to you know from

913
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:25,050
from an association that focuses on risk

914
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,809
management we spend a lot of time

915
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:31,140
differentiating those and and believe me

916
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:33,420
the latter is is much more difficult in

917
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:36,539
terms of coming up with service partners

918
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:40,590
and solutions to to help our members

919
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:43,409
advance the ball thank you Justin yeah

920
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:47,030
what keeps me up at night is definitely

921
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:50,250
I want my clients to be successful and

922
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:52,048
it's it's the the bureaucratic

923
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,210
environment the compliance can by

924
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:55,949
environment sometimes it's almost like

925
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,139
you have to like break rules in order to

926
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:00,210
also follow rules at the same time I

927
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:02,879
think in California it's like ninety

928
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,588
ninety percent of businesses are out of

929
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,380
compliance right now one way or another

930
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:09,568
and I mean I can give you example like

931
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,660
banking right now is very difficult to

932
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:17,210
secure it's very expensive in my home

933
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:21,690
region of Southern Oregon there is no

934
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,970
THC banking available unless you want to

935
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:27,568
go to Salem which is quite north but

936
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:29,548
then the tax the federal government

937
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:31,259
requires that you pay certain taxes

938
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:33,989
electronically so how do you how do you

939
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,180
do that well maybe you get a personal a

940
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:38,548
bank account start commingling funds I'd

941
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:41,098
never recommend doing that but like how

942
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:44,400
do you answer to all of these things

943
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:47,039
it's very difficult and so you know

944
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,490
that's what keeps me up at night thank

945
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,309
you yeah for me I think empathy like

946
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:54,868
actually caring about the members

947
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:58,130
because when I'm forming strategic

948
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:00,778
partnerships it's to directly offer

949
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:03,028
services benefits to our entire

950
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:05,099
membership base so it's not just a

951
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:07,289
partnership of mine it's potentially a

952
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,838
partnership of all 500 businesses that

953
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:12,390
are involved so really doing your

954
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,880
homework and not forming a strategic

955
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:17,308
partnership that's gonna you know screw

956
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,720
over a dozen members and then it's gonna

957
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:20,670
be a sticky situation and our

958
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,868
credibility gets hit and everything like

959
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,460
that so it's a little bit different from

960
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:25,318
an association standpoint because our

961
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,809
partnerships are to facilitate

962
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:29,699
partnerships and when there's that

963
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:32,839
snowball effect if it's good that's

964
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:35,368
great if it's bad it could get messy

965
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:37,380
well and I'd like to circle back to

966
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:38,849
something that a couple of you touched

967
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,470
on which is that mission and

968
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,338
understanding not just your mission but

969
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:43,858
the mission of your strategic

970
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:45,239
partnerships that a mission is not just

971
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:46,920
something that you pay to etched on the

972
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,479
wall behind you that people like clock

973
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,099
in and clock out as they walk by and

974
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,440
ignore it and stop seeing it for years

975
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:54,660
and years your mission statement is

976
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,028
actually what you bounce all your

977
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:59,028
decisions off of does this make

978
00:38:57,028 --> 00:39:01,259
it needs to be a living breathing

979
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:03,418
decision of this is how we do business

980
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:05,548
you may also have a vision statement

981
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:07,438
that helps you you know delineate a few

982
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:10,409
more things but at the end of the day

983
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:13,379
that's not just something that you write

984
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:15,778
down and put aside that is what you can

985
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,179
use to determine whether or not these

986
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:21,809
strategic relationships or partnerships

987
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:24,809
are beneficial to your core mission and

988
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:27,179
your core goals and for the school our

989
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:29,729
mission is to provide quality training

990
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:31,380
for the cannabis industry but at the end

991
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:33,598
of the day I bounce it off of three

992
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,390
things every time what's best for the

993
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,338
students what's best for the staff and

994
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:40,558
faculty and what's best for the school

995
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:42,449
in that order there might be something

996
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:46,289
that's amazing for the students and it

997
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:48,358
will destroy if it's gonna kill the

998
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:50,429
people that have to execute it it's not

999
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,108
a good deal because these are the folks

1000
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:54,630
that you need to embrace and drive it

1001
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:56,159
forward if those two things are there

1002
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,108
but it's gonna break your bottom line

1003
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,209
then maybe you need to bring in another

1004
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:04,048
strategic relationship like an investor

1005
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:07,558
or a CPA or some tax advice but if you

1006
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:10,619
can figure out that core goal and then

1007
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:13,349
bounce off do you measure up to who we

1008
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:17,369
are who we say we are and what we say

1009
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:19,409
we're trying to do I'd say 9/10 decide

1010
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:21,809
right then and there if this is right or

1011
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:23,759
not and now you know who to focus on and

1012
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:26,489
that last thing I'm gonna say it again

1013
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:28,708
decide what you're not gonna be any good

1014
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:32,519
at this is one of the most valuable

1015
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:35,338
lessons I am still trying to learn so

1016
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:38,278
many shiny objects so many amazing

1017
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:41,818
people and some of these shiny objects

1018
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:43,199
are gold they are raw diamonds and some

1019
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:45,568
is fool's gold

1020
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,659
right so I'm not saying shiny objects

1021
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,509
are bad but if you have a way to pan for

1022
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,119
the gold that is your mission these are

1023
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:57,659
your core values that helps you pan for

1024
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,150
the gold just like you two know this can

1025
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:04,528
be successful we can do this together

1026
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:08,068
and it will be good for everybody with

1027
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:08,869
that it is now for 25 I think we nailed

1028
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,788
it folks

1029
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:12,588
and I just genuinely want to thank the

1030
