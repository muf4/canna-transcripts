industry I started investing in Canada

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,450
in 2016 and then in the US and 2017 my

28
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:36,280
background is as a lawyer I spent most

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,350
of my career at DLA Piper in New York

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,189
it's a daily pepper is a global law firm

31
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:44,319
I wrote a white paper in last year

32
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:46,839
called the green regulatory arbitrage a

33
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,459
case for investing in u.s. multi-state

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,439
vertically integrated cannabis companies

35
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,688
that was read all around the world

36
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:55,599
including in Congress and got me invited

37
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:56,919
and I'm part of the US Senate and the US

38
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,099
House of Representatives

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,200
cannabis working groups so I'm in DC

40
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:05,078
twice a month working with senior

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,689
congressional staffers on drafting and

42
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:11,620
advancing a federal cannabis legislation

43
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:15,250
in the United States we're missing today

44
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,539
Lea Hesse who was the chief who is the

45
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,688
chief compliance officer in chief

46
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:24,378
experience officer at forefront she's

47
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:27,078
not here so I'm gonna cover the US side

48
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:29,780
of things in her place so the rest of

49
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:31,969
this panel is going to be a QA but we'll

50
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,068
just start off with a overview of the US

51
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:35,810
landscape first and I'll address that

52
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:39,859
and then we'll move on to Canada and

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,620
Switzerland and Europe in the United

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,090
States we are seeing historic progress

55
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,009
on cannabis legislation it's

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,780
unprecedented what is occurring on a

57
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,908
federal level and state by state level

58
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,180
we're in the hundred and fifteen

59
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:59,750
Congress that concluded in January there

60
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,700
were some 60 measures to legalize

61
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,609
cannabis federally in the United States

62
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:09,560
that is more than all previous

63
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:13,969
congresses combined in the u.s. last

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,098
year there were about 900 bills filed

65
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:18,049
across the United States and various

66
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:22,159
states to legalize cannabis in various

67
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:25,010
states for the entire 2018 just half way

68
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,680
through March of 2019 there are more

69
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:30,429
than 1200 bills filed in states across

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,870
the United States to legalize cannabis

71
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,030
in this Congress there is already

72
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,079
pending legislation covering every

73
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,150
single aspect of legalization what is

74
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,340
advancing right now is a safe banking

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,349
act just passed through the House

76
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,419
Financial Services Committee it's going

77
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:50,509
to move on to the full house it's fully

78
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:52,040
expected to pass a house and there's a

79
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:54,649
good chance it will pass the Senate too

80
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,929
along with banking we're going to see a

81
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,379
lot of major catalysts in the next six

82
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,540
months including a protection for

83
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:04,340
research of cannabis protections for

84
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:06,888
veterans for federal employees using

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,810
cannabis we're gonna see major progress

86
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,329
oh and I think leading to legalization

87
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,598
within 12 to 18 months in the United

88
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:16,370
States we're at a point now where

89
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:19,310
there's a snowball rolling down a hill

90
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,840
that started an avalanche and it's just

91
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,310
a question of how long it will take for

92
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,929
that snowball to pick up enough momentum

93
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,038
but the momentum cannot be reversed

94
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,439
there are congressional cannabis

95
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:31,560
co-chairs working hard in the house and

96
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,718
in the Senate

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,999
there are meanings and full time and

98
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:44,848
people working full time in Congress to

99
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:46,800
legalize cannabis on the state side we

100
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:48,538
have ten states that have adult use

101
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,329
legalized along with Washington DC

102
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:53,490
thirty-three medical states New York and

103
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:55,889
New Jersey are racing forward towards

104
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,710
legalization New Jersey hit a little bit

105
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:02,240
of a hiccup a few weeks we could go but

106
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:04,468
I think that this time next year

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,918
cannabis will be sold in New York

108
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:09,959
probably New Jersey or will be well on

109
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,378
the way towards selling cannabis on the

110
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,728
East Coast in those major states and

111
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,860
Michigan just legalized cannabis

112
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:19,949
Illinois is about to legalize cannabis

113
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,319
too we have now most of the West Coast

114
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,598
with legal cannabis once those middle

115
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,870
states some of in the Midwest of

116
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:30,538
Illinois and Michigan legalize and one

117
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,800
one one East Coast states legalizes like

118
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,139
New York like New Jersey like

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,088
Connecticut or Pennsylvania all the

120
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,560
others will legalize at the same time or

121
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:42,718
very quickly thereafter so at that point

122
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,370
Congress will be forced to act you have

123
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,500
the West the Midwest and the East Coast

124
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,658
so we're moving very quickly towards

125
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,810
legalization I'm just gonna address so

126
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:54,688
far the farm bill and hemp for a little

127
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,569
bit because there's a lot of interest in

128
00:05:54,689 --> 00:06:00,389
hemp hemp CBD products from mainstream

129
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:02,039
companies not just cannabis companies

130
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,288
there are now large CPG companies

131
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,538
looking at our industry and looking at

132
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:11,248
hemp products in the US as an initial

133
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:14,848
entry point so the farm bill passed at

134
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:16,649
the end of 2018 moved the hemp product

135
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:18,990
off of the Controlled Substances Act

136
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,329
hemp is no longer a drug it's now an

137
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,788
agricultural product no longer under the

138
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:26,278
authority of the DEA the Department of

139
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:29,248
the Drug Enforcement Agency it's now

140
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:32,278
under the FDA FDA's authority the Food

141
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:34,349
and Drug Administration the FDA has

142
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:35,968
stepped in and said hang on hemp is

143
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:38,188
federally legal but we still have

144
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:41,129
authority over food and over making

145
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,718
health claims so the FDA has said three

146
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:44,950
has put out three pieces of clar

147
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:48,969
guidance so far you can't add

148
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:51,399
hemp or or CBD from hemp to food you

149
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,740
can't market or sell hemp as a dietary

150
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,349
supplement and you can't make disease or

151
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:00,639
therapeutic claims relating to hemp or

152
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,650
CBD derived from hemp but part of the

153
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,839
complication is that the FDA has

154
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:08,469
licensed drugs containing CBD and THC

155
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,449
but CBD in epidemics once something is a

156
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,860
drug it can no longer be added to a food

157
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:16,449
it can't be sold as a dietary supplement

158
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:19,330
but with the hemp derive CBD my my

159
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,490
prediction is that the FDA realizes that

160
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:23,740
this is a product unlike anything else

161
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,019
we've encountered it's both medicinal

162
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,340
it's used for wellness it's kind of goes

163
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29,620
across the spectrum especially for

164
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,709
cannabis so the FDA realizes there is

165
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,780
trennis demand for this product it can't

166
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:36,489
be a toothless tiger it can't just issue

167
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,789
regulations that people won't follow

168
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,530
there are thousands of companies selling

169
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,420
CBD food products in the United States

170
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:45,129
so the FDA is gonna come out with

171
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,140
regulations that reflect the fact that

172
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,199
there is no real downside demonstrated

173
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:53,169
to CBD just an upside and I think

174
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,050
they'll find a issue new regulations

175
00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:00,280
that will allow CBD to take the form of

176
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,110
to be in a medicine in a drug and make

177
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,859
specific disease claims if it goes

178
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,600
through trials they'll also be I think

179
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,420
the dietary supplement route there'll be

180
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,000
an OTC route and there'll be a GI Ras

181
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,319
route for food products so unprecedented

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,329
but I think the FDA is gonna figure it

183
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:23,829
out and let's move on to Canada so

184
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:26,319
Canada legalized cannabis federally the

185
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:28,149
I think that's a major step towards the

186
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,639
whole world legalizing the US will come

187
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,769
next and I think after that Europe will

188
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,879
quickly follow so let's so look at

189
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:38,620
Canada as a test case so to speak for

190
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,629
recreational and medicine medicinal use

191
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,960
so let's start with the differences

192
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:46,809
between medical and adult use cannabis

193
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,660
in Canada and Carina you want to take

194
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:51,339
that first absolutely yes we are

195
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:54,399
definitely a test case in the world is

196
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,250
watching on October 17 2018 we legalized

197
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,659
recreational cannabis well we had a long

198
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,990
time that we had already

199
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:03,850
medical cannabis in terms of the

200
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,250
cultivation and processing of the

201
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,379
products there really is no difference

202
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,909
Health Canada requires them to be

203
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:12,490
manufactured under good production

204
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,860
practices the main difference lies on

205
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,659
how the products are distributed so if

206
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,909
you're a medical patient you will

207
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,529
register your prescription with a

208
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:22,269
license holder and have that product

209
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,179
delivered to you directly from that

210
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:27,579
license holder the license holder can be

211
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:29,829
anywhere in Canada where as recreational

212
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,440
product is distributed by our provinces

213
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,810
and each province has its own model it

214
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,810
can be private based model or it can be

215
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:40,059
a provincial II run store any adult over

216
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,649
the age of majority or the age of the

217
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:45,250
province has decided can access

218
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:50,409
recreational cannabis John do I wanna

219
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,299
add that yes recreational use of

220
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:54,639
cannabis does not involve any

221
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:56,799
constitutional rights in Canada that was

222
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,860
established in the case I was involved

223
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:03,699
in in 2003 in the Supreme Court of

224
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,080
Canada we started in 1995 rec medical on

225
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,860
the other hand it was a case called

226
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,410
Parker dr. Mutulu mentioned epilepsy mr.

227
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,600
Parker had epilepsy tried everything

228
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,159
with his doctor nothing worked told his

229
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,379
doctor that he took a couple of puffs

230
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,319
that would stop his seizure and so we

231
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:23,379
established that a medically approved

232
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,040
patient has a right of reasonable access

233
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:29,799
to his medicine in order to prevent the

234
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,079
violation of his constitutional rights

235
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,269
to the security of his person and the

236
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,639
right not to have that taken away

237
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:39,699
arbitrarily essentially was the the

238
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,279
bottom line and that was back in 2001

239
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,440
which led to our medical marijuana

240
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,169
access regulations eventually to the

241
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,430
marijuana for medical purposes

242
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:50,079
regulations where the new government was

243
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:52,689
trying to take away the right to grow

244
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,139
for yourself or have somebody grow for

245
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,650
you and ultimately in a more recent case

246
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:01,240
called Allard we established that that

247
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,850
was unconstitutional what they were

248
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,009
trying to do and to make a long story

249
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,720
short we've now evolved into from the

250
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:11,120
access to cannabis for medical purposes

251
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,999
regulations to part 14

252
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,249
the Cannabis act the big defect however

253
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:18,980
is that while the provinces get to

254
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:21,110
distribute cannabis in retail stores and

255
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,629
recreational purposes there are no

256
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,879
equivalent Medical dispensaries or

257
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:29,539
compassion clubs they exist and they

258
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:31,699
have existed since at least 1997 in

259
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:33,469
British Columbia but the government has

260
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:35,799
not provided for that for medical

261
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,389
patients and there's a huge difference

262
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:40,998
between medical patients and their

263
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,860
access and recreational that issue we

264
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,839
are still currently litigating in

265
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,300
Vancouver and it's in the Court of

266
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,569
Appeal so time will tell and hopefully

267
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:53,389
we'll establish that having the ability

268
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:55,248
to go to a medical dispensary will be

269
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,720
part of the patients reasonable access

270
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:59,360
and thanks John

271
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,670
quickly our extracts extracted products

272
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,839
legal on the adult youths market in

273
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:08,870
Canada today not yet not currently about

274
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,870
edible well edibles extracts and

275
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,120
topicals are subject to consultations at

276
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,259
the moment in order to they're going to

277
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,808
be regulated as of October of this year

278
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:23,300
one year from the date of legalizing rec

279
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:26,899
the problem is they're going to limit

280
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:29,240
the amount of THC to I think it's 10

281
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:32,600
milligrams in the edibles and the

282
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:36,370
extract one of my clients and a lard is

283
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:40,159
a 25 gram a day approved medical patient

284
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,220
who was brain damaged and who's now off

285
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:46,458
all of his opiates and only on cannabis

286
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:49,670
he would have to buy 2,500 packages from

287
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:52,188
the store in order to get his supply so

288
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:54,289
he would probably get sick from the

289
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:57,919
sugar in the edibles

290
00:12:54,289 --> 00:13:00,078
so there really aren't you know they're

291
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,759
simply going to encourage the

292
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,278
underground market to continue because

293
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,220
people novice users may need small

294
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,470
amounts but there are established

295
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,178
medical users who will not overdose or

296
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,199
take too much or so there won't be

297
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:14,480
suffered there won't be separate

298
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:17,748
regulations for medical users the

299
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,659
medical or a dabbles and extract there

300
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:21,560
no they currently they don't plan to do

301
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:23,269
that

302
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,939
that's something that we will be pushing

303
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:29,569
for what about importing and exporting

304
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,370
cannabis to and from Canada so import

305
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,778
into Canada right now has allowed for

306
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,580
medical scientific purposes and export

307
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:38,960
is permitted so in both cases you need

308
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,580
to have the correct import-export

309
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,050
permits and the correct licenses on both

310
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,700
sides of the border where you're

311
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:45,829
importing and John what about for hemp

312
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,629
can you can you import and export hemp

313
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:52,460
and extracted cabinets from him yes it's

314
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:54,409
the limitation as I understand it is you

315
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,050
can only import or export and you need a

316
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:59,389
permit for each importer export for

317
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:02,088
scientific medical or industrial hemp

318
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:04,039
purposes so there is provision for

319
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,890
import/export of industrial hemp and

320
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,139
there's some technical stuff to do with

321
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,240
very minor amounts of THC which make it

322
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,759
easier to import export but generally

323
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,049
the same rules apply and the same for a

324
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:20,360
CBD I thought from hemp would that yeah

325
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:23,569
my understanding would be the same hey

326
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,259
you know what what are the kind of

327
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,700
highlights and maybe mistakes or things

328
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,250
that could have gone better

329
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,170
in Canada's rollout of adult youth

330
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,149
legalization I think one of the

331
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:37,879
highlights is seeing the market really

332
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:41,389
expand historically we've been limited

333
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,980
by a few large players in cannabis and

334
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,659
now that the licensing is picking up

335
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,759
there's a lot more opportunities for new

336
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:49,129
players to bring in their bring in their

337
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,850
products bring in their brands also with

338
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,899
October 17th legalization they opened up

339
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,940
what companies are now allowed to

340
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,559
declare new genetics into the system

341
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,800
which is very important for

342
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,569
diversification of products in terms of

343
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,838
areas for improvement definitely I think

344
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,740
the advertising and labeling

345
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,500
restrictions need to be critically

346
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,659
assessed if you know Health Canada has

347
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,399
said that one of their objectives is to

348
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:15,708
eliminate the black market but if you

349
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,429
can't build a brand that's going to be

350
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:21,289
very challenging for businesses one of

351
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:23,389
the things that I think that I thought

352
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:25,039
was true Justin Trudeau Prime Minister

353
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,549
Trudeau was most effective in convincing

354
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,799
people that adult use would be a good

355
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:33,529
for Canada actually was a high rate of

356
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,659
teen of teen usage in Canada and the

357
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:38,629
fact that legalization regular

358
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:42,740
eliminates or reduces the black market

359
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:45,409
how has that actually played out it's

360
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,210
still very very early certainly it is

361
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,709
another one of Health Canada's policy

362
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,259
objectives is to keep it out of the

363
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,480
hands of youth I have a 14 year old it's

364
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,879
also one of my objectives but it's still

365
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,100
very very early I mean the market still

366
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,539
has supply limitations and it's going to

367
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,330
be a few years before we actually

368
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:04,519
realize those objectives John what do

369
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,620
you take away from Canada it's a

370
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,360
legalization for adult use highlights

371
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,110
things that could have gone better the

372
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,240
effect on you thought usage well

373
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:17,240
currently the underground market

374
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,840
continues to thrive there's lots of

375
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,180
complaints about product quality the

376
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,460
good thing was the announcement that

377
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:27,289
they have micro producers in micro

378
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,379
processors to bring in the craft

379
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:32,990
industry unfortunately the cost of

380
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:35,990
trying to do that has become prohibitive

381
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:38,690
and so we don't have all of a sudden

382
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:42,470
many microbes that have been approved so

383
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:45,470
we're not doing well and bringing in the

384
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,420
smaller producers who have been part of

385
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,360
the market my biggest criticism is that

386
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:53,179
Canada has tried to create a new market

387
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,519
instead of bringing everybody in rolling

388
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,709
everybody in as we did for alcohol years

389
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,049
ago with the Kennedys and the brothels

390
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,230
and the Seagrams why not roll them in

391
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:05,149
regulate them give them licenses in that

392
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:09,110
way we could continue the existing

393
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,189
industry Karina I was on Canada gonna

394
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:14,419
compete globally

395
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:18,100
when cannabis can be grown for much much

396
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:21,170
cheaper in South America and Africa and

397
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:24,438
the US and California is where many many

398
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:27,050
global brands come from agree we have

399
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,840
work to do and we do have a first mover

400
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:32,539
advantage so I think that by using our

401
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,579
homegrown talent as well as the research

402
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:36,680
that's taking off now in Canada I think

403
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:38,869
those are advantages for us certainly

404
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,990
growing outside in Canada is not as good

405
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:43,879
as growing outside in Colombia but we do

406
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,099
have a lot of talent in our industry to

407
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,930
bring that to the world

408
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,889
god I just think we you need to

409
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,590
understand that

410
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,500
Canada has legalized a little bit you

411
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:56,629
can grow four plants per household and

412
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,730
they were going to make it it had to be

413
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,809
a hundred centimeters and no more but I

414
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,029
think they realized that the police

415
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:03,470
would then have to have tape measures on

416
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:05,960
their belts and that the plant might

417
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,480
suddenly sprout between Friday and

418
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,750
Monday but so they abandoned that at

419
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,370
least but you can possess 30 grams in

420
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,339
you're out and about so that's the

421
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:19,099
that's the legalization if you breach

422
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:21,199
the act and go slightly over say five or

423
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,178
six plants or 50 grams or whatever

424
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,058
there's a ticketing scheme that's what

425
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:28,340
we call decriminalization with a maximum

426
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:31,339
fine I think it's $200 something like

427
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:34,209
that but if you go above that there's

428
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:36,709
still a lot of criminal law Canada's

429
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,090
legislation that they're constitutional

430
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,890
power they've used the still the

431
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:41,750
criminal law and they've simply given

432
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,419
the provinces the permission to do the

433
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,390
the retail distribution and so when

434
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,610
you're above the ticketing scheme we

435
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,250
have still the summary and indictable

436
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:54,918
offences you probably understand better

437
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,890
if I use the u.s. misdemeanor for

438
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:00,559
summary and felony for indictable and

439
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,660
the maximum penalties on indictment in

440
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,428
Canada is still 14 years imprisonment

441
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,710
which the Conservative government jacked

442
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:09,259
up from seven years and the latane

443
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,319
Commission back in 1972 recommended a

444
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:14,569
max of five years so that has all kinds

445
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,879
of legal consequences in terms of the

446
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:20,269
continued use of the criminal law so

447
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,280
that's the the Canadian model it's not I

448
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,230
mean I think a lot of it's smoke and

449
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,119
mirrors in order to pacify the right

450
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,910
wing and I'll be surprised to see people

451
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,889
getting busted for those sorts of

452
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,259
indictable offences but that is the

453
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:37,490
landscape and so there's going to be a

454
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:38,960
lot to watch as we roll along do you

455
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,700
want to talk about the single convention

456
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,100
we didn't rehearse this but do you want

457
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,798
to address that all I can address that

458
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:48,019
people need to understand that unlike

459
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:49,879
the US where I think when you pass a

460
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,190
treaty it becomes part of the law of the

461
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,260
land that's not the case in Canada in

462
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,210
Canada we have to pass domestic

463
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:59,329
legislation in order to implement a

464
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,829
treaty and when Canada implemented the

465
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:02,389
treaty and passed the Controlled Drugs

466
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:06,549
and Substances Act

467
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:09,740
that's the current Act we expressly

468
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:12,589
provided that the Minister could make

469
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,950
exemptions to the act in relation to a

470
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:18,889
drug type of drug classes of persons and

471
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,539
so on so we reserved the ability to do

472
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,670
what we're doing so sorry for

473
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:24,759
interrupting so in Canada basically

474
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,289
you've been able to legalize

475
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,539
notwithstanding your participation it is

476
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,680
a little bit right not technically in

477
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,930
agreement with the international

478
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,000
cheating we signed but we're in

479
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,950
compliance with our law understood right

480
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,630
in the in the u.s. some that's one of

481
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,460
the issues that they're grappling with

482
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,410
in Congress it's an international treaty

483
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,029
called a single convention that would

484
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,580
prevent the United States from

485
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:49,339
effectively complying with the treaty

486
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:51,309
and federally legalizing cannabis for

487
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:54,169
European countries it's a big deal too I

488
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:56,809
think that the just like in Canada the

489
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,150
US will find a way around it and at that

490
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:02,569
point it's going to cause I think the

491
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:07,070
rest of the world to follow suit let's

492
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:11,859
move to Europe Francis and you show me a

493
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:15,049
picture of your finest with chocolate

494
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:17,929
which I and one thing that struck me was

495
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:24,019
that your packaging was very very clever

496
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:28,820
to comply with the legal landscape that

497
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:31,970
you have to navigate so can you just

498
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:36,889
give us an overview of what is the

499
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:39,410
status of hemp derived products um in

500
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,470
Switzerland and EU more more broadly

501
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,600
okay this should be entitled navigating

502
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,509
a minefield because it's a really

503
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:50,139
complicated topic you know up until 2018

504
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:52,309
it was already a very difficult subject

505
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,440
because in the different countries and

506
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,869
you have a lot of fragmentation in terms

507
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,170
of how the regulations are interpreted

508
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:03,199
by the authorities but things became a

509
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,440
way more confusing in January because

510
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,019
the European Commission decided to

511
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,140
update what's called a novel food

512
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:14,089
catalog and if you're familiar with the

513
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,879
novel food regulation it's it's a

514
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:20,978
regulation that dated

515
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:23,078
dates from Maine 1997 at that time the

516
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:25,778
the European Commission decided to enact

517
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:28,239
this regulation in order to protect

518
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:30,788
public health so the spirit of the

519
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:33,489
regulation is actually to to ensure that

520
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:36,190
food operators they continue to innovate

521
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:38,679
or win it within a framework which

522
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,259
allows for an approval process of

523
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:45,839
anything that would be considered novel

524
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:52,538
that means not eaten prior to May 1997

525
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:54,278
and also to to give guidance so to

526
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:58,509
operators and to regulators

527
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:00,909
so in January what happened was that in

528
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:02,949
the in the catalog you can google it you

529
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:04,899
can go onto the the novel foods catalog

530
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:07,778
it's very simple and you can type in

531
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:11,468
cannabis and you will come up with

532
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:13,838
actually three entries at the moment one

533
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:16,538
has been cancelled and that was kind of

534
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:19,058
video the other one is kind of a sativa

535
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:21,848
L and then they created a new one called

536
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:23,949
cannabinoids now up until the 20th of

537
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:25,568
January of this year we only had two we

538
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:27,190
only had one which was kind of a sativa

539
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:29,588
L and cannabadiol

540
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,139
so under cannabis sativa L it was a

541
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:34,628
wonderful green tick meaning that it

542
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:37,508
could be used in a food product okay

543
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:39,939
because it's been used for centuries in

544
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:42,548
Europe it's not novel it's not

545
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,429
considered novel the plant all right but

546
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:46,568
it also depends on the part of the plant

547
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:50,139
whether you're talking about the seeds

548
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:51,608
the flower the leaves and this all is

549
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:54,758
interpreted differently in different

550
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:56,858
legislations as well because the bottom

551
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:00,878
line with the novel food regulation is

552
00:23:56,858 --> 00:24:04,328
that the European Commission also defers

553
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:07,388
to the individual country in terms of

554
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:09,308
their own specific regulations so then

555
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:12,488
you can have these torques and tweaks in

556
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:14,408
the application of that right so it's

557
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:16,649
very confusing and you really need to

558
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:21,729
know the regulations

559
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:25,328
you want to say go on and you're

560
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:27,609
packaging iuu cleverly intimate that

561
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:28,599
there is CBD because you're getting a

562
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:31,149
full spectrum M

563
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,339
product without saying there is CBD in

564
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,620
it which I thought was a clever solution

565
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,990
what about because in a full spectrum

566
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:41,019
hemp back you know product you have CBD

567
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:43,150
it's natural right right and but I don't

568
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:44,829
say CBD I can't say CBD if you say and

569
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,400
this is why you see what's happening

570
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:50,230
since probably the last since November

571
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,330
December in a lot of countries in Europe

572
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,920
like Austria they started removing a lot

573
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:56,949
of products from the market from the

574
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:00,580
shelves in Italy that took place as well

575
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:02,500
cannabis stores were getting fines so

576
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:05,289
it's kind of like the regulator's

577
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,660
suddenly woke up you know because they

578
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:10,379
they enacted a new novel food regulation

579
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,850
from January 2018 replacing the 97

580
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,890
regulation and it was like it there was

581
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:17,649
a delayed effect because it was at the

582
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,320
end of 2018 the different countries in

583
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:23,290
Europe started to actively remove

584
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,539
products and sent warning letters to

585
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:27,430
operators to remove their products but

586
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:30,190
don't you think though it's really just

587
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,720
a matter of time because if we talk

588
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,490
about something like alcohol or even

589
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,710
pharmaceutical products the regulators

590
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,870
are struggling with the advantages and

591
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,430
the disadvantages the side effects the

592
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:43,629
bad effects right yeah here we have a

593
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:48,549
product without there are some minor

594
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:49,960
example situations and certain people

595
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,480
have certain problems maybe can't have

596
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,309
too much CBD but in general terms there

597
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,430
is not really recognized downside to

598
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:59,500
that right so no and you saw what what

599
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,009
happened at the United Nations with the

600
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,839
w-h-o with the expert committee and

601
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:06,759
drugs independence last year so there

602
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:08,709
was a lot of good news around CBD there

603
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,079
was two sessions last year the 40th and

604
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,069
41st sessions in the 40th session they

605
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:17,109
actually made a recommendation that CBD

606
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:20,159
and also cannabis extracts should be

607
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:23,709
deleted from the schedule one of the

608
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,140
1961 single convention of narcotics

609
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,940
right and then in another session I

610
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,340
think it was October November October

611
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:36,519
and they're not I was I tend to both of

612
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:38,289
them as a guest yeah and in the second

613
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,049
one then they talked about THC and they

614
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:42,389
talked about analogs of THC in that and

615
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,250
then you saw that there

616
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,040
commendations were published in January

617
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,319
24th there was the letter they sent a

618
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,720
letter to the Secretary General of the

619
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,769
United Nation with the recommendations

620
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,190
to delist these products from vista

621
00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:00,420
scheduling and on the 7th of march that

622
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,580
was supposed to be a vote that it was

623
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:06,210
postponed by the commission on our

624
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:09,359
narcotic drugs in vienna so that's still

625
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,579
pending I mean it's good news and it

626
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,750
will give a very good positive sign to

627
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,909
all the different countries that have

628
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,250
signed up to that convention but but I

629
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,830
think we're still you know it has to be

630
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,799
translated into you know legislation

631
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:24,539
I mean legislation and regulation is

632
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,069
important and safeguarding all these

633
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:28,859
products making the keeping the public

634
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:31,200
safe is of course a prime importance but

635
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:34,439
in the United States we have cannabis

636
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,779
cannabis edibles for years and years in

637
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,340
markets and nothing has ever happened to

638
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:40,710
anyone I mean no one has died from

639
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,449
having a cannabis edibles some people go

640
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,420
to the hospital maybe from having way

641
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,069
too much THC and ER doctors say that

642
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,710
they just tell them to go to sleep and

643
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:51,480
so it's not we're not dealing with a

644
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,610
very dangerous situation I think and the

645
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,069
regulators will just have to wrap their

646
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:59,069
hands heads around all it and recognize

647
00:27:56,069 --> 00:28:00,629
that the market demand is there and they

648
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:02,129
have to meet that demand did you want to

649
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,100
add something John just I'm always

650
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:07,050
entertained by Health Canada has on its

651
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,929
webpage information for health care

652
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:12,809
practitioners supervise doctors what to

653
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:14,580
do so there's a section at the very end

654
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:16,619
of that that talks about overdose and

655
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,169
toxicity and of course the first line is

656
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:21,599
there's no lethal dose and the second

657
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:24,029
one is is that yes some people get panic

658
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,939
attacks and anxiety and in those rare

659
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:29,129
cases doctor when you see something like

660
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,930
that you sit the person diet down and

661
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,080
quietly assured them that everything's

662
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,360
going to be okay and maybe in a rare

663
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,129
case give them a benzodiazepine and I'm

664
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:42,479
not sure that's a good advice anymore

665
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:45,900
what we were learning about benzos so I

666
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,880
think we covered a lot of ground this

667
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,330
industry and it is the title of my white

668
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,550
paper from an investor's perspective

669
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:55,899
this is a regulatory arbitrage from a

670
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:58,059
business operators perspective your

671
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,610
as Francis said navigating a regulatory

672
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,549
minefield but I think if you're looking

673
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:05,769
at this from an investor's perspective

674
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:08,799
there's a lot of mismatch of value in

675
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:12,099
this industry there's regulatory risk

676
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,899
and overhang that suppresses valuations

677
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:16,769
especially in the United States right

678
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:20,500
where we have robust state legal

679
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:23,710
economies but federal illegality which

680
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,960
causes a wall to institutional capital

681
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,809
to big related industry companies to

682
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,460
enter the industry to things like

683
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,960
sovereign wealth funds and pension funds

684
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,789
in the Church of England can't can't

685
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,460
invest in the United States cannabis and

686
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:39,129
also in the industry has enormous

687
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,259
burdens like paying 80 to 90 percent

688
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,720
marginal tax rates because it can't

689
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:45,129
deduct the cost of goods sold we can't

690
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,740
do research you can't of interstate

691
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:50,050
commerce still hard to attract top

692
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,059
professionals all these barriers will

693
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:54,369
come crashing down with federal

694
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:59,440
legalization so if anybody is looking at

695
00:29:54,369 --> 00:30:02,349
the investment landscape I think look at

696
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,269
it from the regulatory lens because

697
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:06,819
that's where you'll find our bajaj

698
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:10,029
opportunities where things are not

699
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:13,329
valued at where they would be if this

700
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:15,250
was a regular industry and it will be

701
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:17,679
one day but but if you wait till then

702
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,990
you might as well just invest in our

703
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,900
restaurant or any other industry right

704
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,870
now there's a lot of opportunity here

705
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:27,340
that regulations are creating is also a

706
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:29,679
bit can I add one more thing on the

707
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:31,449
European situation just just to finish -

708
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,190
yeah we spent a lot of time on North

709
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:38,200
America so yeah we're in Berlin so I

710
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,720
really touched on just one or two things

711
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,220
but just to finish on the European

712
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,140
situation at the moment because of what

713
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:53,740
happened in January with the changes in

714
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:56,680
the novel Foods catalog in March the

715
00:30:53,740 --> 00:31:00,150
European industrial hemp Association

716
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:04,410
they met with the working group of the

717
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:08,050
Standing Committee of whatsit now plants

718
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:09,370
animals food and feed and this is the

719
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,379
group of

720
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:13,509
experts basically that the European

721
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,790
Commission deferred to in terms of their

722
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:18,129
approval process in signing off

723
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:20,259
approving or not approving anything

724
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,940
related to novel foods it was an

725
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:26,019
important meeting because the hemp

726
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:28,630
Association were able to put before this

727
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:31,690
committee good reasons and actually

728
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,730
showed 14 different examples of how hemp

729
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,009
had already been consumed in Europe

730
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,319
since they that the oldest example they

731
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:41,829
show it was from a tour in Bologna an

732
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:43,210
old tower from 1220 and it was a

733
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:46,240
wonderful inscription on the walls

734
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:50,759
because they the inscription said bread

735
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,960
is life cannabis protects ya and

736
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,058
protects in the sense of homeostasis

737
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,470
bringing equilibrium to the body and

738
00:31:55,058 --> 00:32:01,389
then the one I like wine is joy alright

739
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,390
that that's how they they wrote it on

740
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:06,160
12:20 because there's a huge history of

741
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,650
the consumption of hemp in in Europe

742
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,370
even though even Pope Martin v was was

743
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,929
eating hemp soup you know so there's a

744
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:15,639
there's a lot of good arguments they

745
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,470
they made their case I think they did a

746
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,990
very good job and and if there's anybody

747
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,179
from the EHA in the room hats off to

748
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:25,120
them I think it was great because they

749
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:29,470
they're really trying to clarify this

750
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:31,269
gray area between what's medical and

751
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,910
what's recreational you know because

752
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:36,160
there's this whole area of relating to

753
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:39,190
cosmetics relating to food food

754
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,590
supplements also a construction and

755
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:45,190
industrial uses of hemp and they're

756
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:48,308
they're really pushing to to to to have

757
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,840
clear regulations on that the last thing

758
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:53,589
that's happened just recently on the

759
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:56,889
22nd of March so just a few days ago an

760
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:58,859
MEP from Italy called Marcos ulla he

761
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:01,059
made a written question because a

762
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,740
politician or a political party or a

763
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:04,928
political organization in Europe has the

764
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,730
right to make a what's called a written

765
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,830
question has to be a written question to

766
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,110
the European Commission and it was a

767
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:14,710
very great question because with all

768
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:16,839
this confusion going on he clearly

769
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,360
stated he clearly asked a commission so

770
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:22,089
are you going to come out with

771
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,389
legislation regarding the area of food

772
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:24,819
and

773
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,259
cosmetics right really peas put that

774
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:28,480
he's put their back up against the wall

775
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:31,150
with the request to answer that question

776
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,509
in six weeks and if you mentioned that

777
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:36,759
practice of a bunch of Congress men and

778
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:39,160
women also bipartisan basis sent a

779
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,529
letter to the FDA Commissioner same

780
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,870
exact letter two weeks ago well my dear

781
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:46,180
by the time of the next ICBC in zurich

782
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:47,649
that should correspond to when hopefully

783
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,120
we'll have an answer from the european

784
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:53,440
commission which will hopefully clarify

785
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:55,419
things so stay tuned so there it's a

786
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,820
moving target a lot of this a lot of

787
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,100
these topics and yeah as Francis said

788
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:01,509
it's rapidly changing what things will

789
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:18,130
look different a year from now let's

790
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:20,440
open it up to some questions yep okay of

791
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,880
course well we'll go this way and then

792
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:31,380
we'll go that way and we're coming

793
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:35,260
around here we go alright Genzo a

794
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:38,590
American attorney question about we

795
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:42,070
currently have state regimes wildly

796
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:44,890
disparate in how they enforce say

797
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,659
Massachusetts in Maine right next to

798
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:49,269
each other and completely different laws

799
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:52,230
on how you grow who can grow how much it

800
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:55,179
costs do you think when we have

801
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,219
congressional action and it's legal

802
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:59,430
everywhere that the states that haven't

803
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:01,659
legalized are gonna have an easier time

804
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:04,809
moving forward because they don't have

805
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:09,639
to undo all of the restrictive regimes

806
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:12,429
that are in place now under the current

807
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:14,650
proposed legislation that is most likely

808
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:17,349
to succeed it which is a states act or

809
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,809
some modified version of that the states

810
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:21,639
are gonna still be left to regulate what

811
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:23,380
happens in their own states I mean we

812
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:25,420
see that in many other industries right

813
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,400
just if you want to become a barber in

814
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,960
New York State it's different than

815
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,030
becoming a barber in another state it's

816
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,289
just a little different and every state

817
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,269
has their own regulations I think we're

818
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:36,009
gonna see that with cannabis to I think

819
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:37,690
it might be some time before

820
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:40,660
cannabis is sold in Mississippi or

821
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:43,990
Alabama but it's just their loss I think

822
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:46,000
but but every state is gonna proceed

823
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:49,659
differently and they'll have their own

824
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,789
regulations now cultivation though it's

825
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:54,069
going to change once there's interstate

826
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:58,570
commerce so it's naturally going to have

827
00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:01,059
an effect on the realities within each

828
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:04,870
state but I think the in the u.s. we

829
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:06,969
have a strong state powers states are

830
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,739
assigned a high degree of powers versus

831
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:10,209
the federal government and they're gonna

832
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:13,299
continue to be able to assert their

833
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:16,269
authority over cannabis for sure there's

834
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,980
a little bit of parallel with Canada and

835
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:19,929
the EU because the states are gonna have

836
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,780
to be careful that they do have a

837
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:24,219
standard quality management requirement

838
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,990
for the product otherwise they're going

839
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:27,250
to create more trade yeah one of the

840
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:29,139
things we're struggling with in the

841
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,239
United States is that it's on a

842
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:34,119
state-by-state basis now to regulate

843
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:36,159
things like cannabis in food and states

844
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,420
are not equipped they don't have health

845
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,899
departments that are capable of

846
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,190
regulating food products the FDA

847
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,380
regulates food products for the United

848
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,539
States and states are looking to the FDA

849
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,690
for guidance but the FDA is not

850
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:51,190
regulating cannabis so once there is

851
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,289
federal legalization I think there will

852
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,329
be a much more unified situation in the

853
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:56,860
United States but despite that states

854
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:59,079
can go off and do their own thing

855
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,809
despite on top of that there's a big

856
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:03,819
distinction to appreciate between Canada

857
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:06,099
and the US criminal law is federal in

858
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,900
Canada whereas it's state power in the

859
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:10,269
US and that's why if you go back and

860
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,579
look at history prohibition started in

861
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:15,369
Utah and crept across the country mainly

862
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:18,880
against the Mexicans and eventually

863
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:20,549
Canada made prohibited in 1923 and your

864
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,950
federal government didn't do it till

865
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,470
1937 now history is rolling back the

866
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:28,689
other way and we've legalized so we

867
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:29,649
expect your federal government to do it

868
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,750
in the next 12 months

869
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,789
but but it actually is the federal

870
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,760
criminal law in the United States that

871
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:39,250
is that impedes the industry right the

872
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,470
Schedule one status which makes it a

873
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,599
crime right to to engage in commerce

874
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:46,419
with with cannabis is what makes it a

875
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,489
federal crime so we have state criminal

876
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,809
legislation but also federal crimes for

877
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:51,818
being involved in inter

878
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:56,739
the commerce related to cannabis and

879
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:59,708
other questions here Oh YUM okay free

880
00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:02,139
cannabis hemp in Avalon Glastonbury my

881
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:04,719
question relates to the food regulations

882
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:07,208
novelty foods and novel ways of getting

883
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,548
around it wipers I've been selling CBD

884
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:12,188
Pro it's about five years now one in

885
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:13,630
first and Britain I think and since

886
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:16,298
January what I've been doing is selling

887
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,338
banks are unbeaten Sindhu temple incense

888
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:20,349
with the disclaimer but legally this

889
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:22,328
product is not for use by the person the

890
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,949
person is the legal fiction and that's

891
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:26,140
the awareness is happening in Britain

892
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:28,719
now is people becoming aware of the

893
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:31,208
fraud or the name the fiction and all

894
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,729
the criminality of prohibition my

895
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,228
question relates to is their movement

896
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,838
within Europe who are people have had

897
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:39,429
enough of the actual blatant crime of

898
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,588
cannabis prohibition and we all have an

899
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:43,478
essential need for this plant so any

900
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:46,028
legislation prohibiting that must be

901
00:38:43,478 --> 00:38:49,268
criminal its anti human and is there

902
00:38:46,028 --> 00:38:52,028
movement in well worldwide to actually

903
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:52,389
people being empowered to just get on

904
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:55,028
with it

905
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:57,400
grow the plant and share it within their

906
00:38:55,028 --> 00:39:02,079
communities you're touching on the whole

907
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:04,239
topic of hypocrisy yeah and and I can't

908
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,778
give you a straight answer because it

909
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,338
still is that situation unfortunately

910
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:11,380
there's a mass uprising that's right and

911
00:39:09,338 --> 00:39:12,938
that's why I think you said like it

912
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,318
can't be stopped it's a way that's

913
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:16,538
moving forward can't be stopped it's a

914
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,889
wonderful thing it's fantastic it's

915
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:20,349
amazing well we've seen what we've seen

916
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:23,498
in the US ultimately is is that business

917
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:26,109
and tax revenues are what is moving the

918
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:28,058
conversation forward this is ultimately

919
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:29,949
about individual liberty and about

920
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:32,410
people being able to use whatever

921
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:37,889
medicine or whatever makes them feel

922
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:40,868
good but ultimately what is driving

923
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:46,509
politicians who might otherwise not be

924
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:49,059
convinced is the dollars right so that's

925
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:51,849
what causes political progress to be

926
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:54,640
made that's the reality I've been

927
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:57,689
involved in this since 1972 so it can't

928
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,688
happen quickly enough

929
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:08,460
sorry I'm coming here ago if you do like

930
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,970
another eyes and realize you're from

931
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,150
Berlin

932
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:16,709
as much as I understand that there's an

933
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:18,690
outcry in the industry about CVD entry

934
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,840
and then the novel food cutter look but

935
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:23,970
if CVD and hemp products are food then

936
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,920
they automatically fall on the food

937
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:28,259
revelation that was not made to legalize

938
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,108
CBD it had nothing to do with it

939
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,180
so CVD extracts are now treated like any

940
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:36,150
other plant extract like rosemary oil

941
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:37,769
are a protein extract so it's for me

942
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,200
it's completely plausible that the

943
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:42,929
moment you enrich and isolate something

944
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:45,059
you fall on the regular food regulation

945
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:46,829
exactly how it should be yeah

946
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,929
in the u.s. we have a complication

947
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:54,199
though where CBD has been approved as a

948
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:54,199
drug so you can't add drugs to food yeah

949
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,559
look at the marketing claims there is

950
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,869
another issue coming

951
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,099
but for me it's completely logical that

952
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:04,108
the next rackets

953
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:06,809
as food has to be treated like any other

954
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:09,509
extract sorry yeah it's either it's

955
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:11,070
either medical or food in Europe it's

956
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,350
very clear-cut between the two there's

957
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,910
no with this grey zone for sure because

958
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:17,159
a lot of operators don't know where to

959
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:18,719
go but there it's that's the way the

960
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,149
regulator looks at it signed their

961
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:24,209
medical or food one or the other okay

962
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:28,019
but if a big pharmaceutical company gets

963
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,608
a patent for CBD to be in a drug product

964
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,829
that means that you won't be able to

965
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:35,340
have it in a food anymore but if I have

966
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:39,329
I'm using a full-spectrum hemp and it's

967
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:40,858
naturally present right yeah the

968
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:44,730
question I think was directly related to

969
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:47,789
CBD right you know isolate no there's

970
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,858
any extra I remember I I you know the

971
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:51,539
beginning of my little journey over a

972
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:53,130
year and a half ago I went to my

973
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:54,779
regulator I went to my local regulator

974
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,640
and I went to the controlling laboratory

975
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,160
and I said so I want to do this I want

976
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,618
to make chocolate help me what do I need

977
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,269
to comply with and there and they said

978
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:06,300
well basically there's three main things

979
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:10,920
one the plant has to be

980
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:12,390
EU any use from the use certified hemp

981
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,019
meaning that it has to be one of the

982
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:15,868
hemp right

983
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:18,570
under the common registry in the EU is

984
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:21,510
69 at the moment - it's got to be a

985
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:24,269
traditional processing technique so very

986
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,650
very specifically you can't add CBD to

987
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:28,170
it or take it away you can't manipulate

988
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,570
it it has to reflect what's extracted

989
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:35,789
front naturally from the plant okay and

990
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:38,130
three no THC no THC is zero in Europe in

991
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:39,900
Switzerland is one percent Swiss insula

992
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:44,730
is an outlier you know Switzer's pioneer

993
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,500
when it comes to a lot of things but but

994
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,409
zero also depends on the country you

995
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,719
know because you have some some people

996
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:53,670
say oh my analytical technique goes down

997
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:56,429
to zero point zero zero zero something

998
00:42:53,670 --> 00:43:00,780
that's my zero or in another country at

999
00:42:56,429 --> 00:43:02,309
0.3 or 0.5 or 0.6 and that's where the

1000
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,780
headaches start because if you're an

1001
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:05,549
operator and you're producing a Swiss

1002
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,140
chocolate like I am I mean I do other

1003
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:10,619
things too because I suck like you've

1004
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:12,089
got farmers but you know and you want to

1005
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,769
make a product that's compliant for the

1006
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,019
whole of the EU that's tricky

1007
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:19,889
yeah that's tricky you have to be very

1008
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:21,750
careful Canada the limit is 0.3 percent

1009
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:25,618
THC which i think is the same in the US

1010
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,750
and there's no limits on cannabidiol or

1011
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:29,760
other cannabinoids in the hemp but it's

1012
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:34,739
because it's not a controlled substance

1013
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,300
CBD yeah it never was well we have

1014
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,099
industrial hemp regulations and

1015
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,230
historically that really allowed you to

1016
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:43,019
make hemp hearts and really nothing much

1017
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,849
else until these regulations were put

1018
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:46,739
under the cannabis Act and those

1019
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:49,650
limitations don't exist anymore and

1020
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:52,649
there are specific exemptions if your

1021
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:56,250
hemp product is made from the seed and

1022
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:59,160
is less than 10 micrograms of THC

1023
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,858
that's not governed by the act other

1024
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:03,589
than requirements of what you put on the

1025
00:44:01,858 --> 00:44:05,549
label when you're importing or exporting

1026
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,230
fantastic we have time for one more

1027
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,060
brief question and then we're gonna I'm

1028
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,858
sorry you guys I got it back here but

1029
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,849
I'm sure they'll be they'd love to talk

1030
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:14,639
to you in the hallway here one last

1031
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:17,130
question hi Mike Coogan from the United

1032
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,139
States thank you all could you elaborate

1033
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:21,480
on the disparity between the Single

1034
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:23,429
Convention and US federal law and what

1035
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,068
might be done to sort of reconcile those

1036
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:29,078
two regulatory frameworks thank you

1037
00:44:26,068 --> 00:44:32,458
so right now I don't think there's a

1038
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:39,189
there's a disparity I think if the US

1039
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:40,568
would legalize cannabis which is one of

1040
00:44:39,188 --> 00:44:42,208
the drugs that's included in the Single

1041
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:45,009
Convention then there would be a

1042
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:48,489
disparity and I think that it would

1043
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:51,309
require the u.s. probably to withdraw

1044
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:53,249
from it or get the treaty amended

1045
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:57,640
because the treaties are that the u.s.

1046
00:44:53,248 --> 00:45:00,429
signs on to become part of US federal

1047
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:04,838
law basically so something will have to

1048
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:06,728
be done but the US has dealt with more

1049
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:09,248
complicated international treaty

1050
00:45:06,728 --> 00:45:13,419
obligations than that and there are ways

1051
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:15,868
for the Congress to address that um

1052
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,489
senator Schatz from Hawaii is

1053
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:21,068
particularly focused on this I can

1054
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:24,789
connect you with him if you want to take

1055
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:26,228
this take up this issue further thank

1056
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,910
you all so very much I'm sorry that

1057
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:29,468
we're out of time

1058
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:31,928
one more time for our excellent panel

1059
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:34,809
was an excellent overview we really

1060
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:38,969
appreciate your time and your energy and

1061
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:38,969
your thoughts and your discussion
