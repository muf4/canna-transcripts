1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,149
straight plate the president CTO lives

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:14,339
here per day thanks for the nice intro

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,199
we are going to break tradition from the

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,778
other formatted discussions that are

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,880
panels that you've seen here we've got a

6
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:23,100
very diverse panel we're studying

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,349
advancements in medical science from the

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,779
perspective of cannabis cannabinoid

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,599
medicine and we have a very diverse

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:34,019
group here so I'd like to give everyone

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,238
the ability to introduce themselves with

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,840
the support of some slides and to give

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:43,589
them the ability to fill in the blanks

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,210
so interestingly I'm the only one up

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,800
here that does not have an MD or a PhD

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,789
but I come to you with some interesting

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:56,009
experience so a couple of years ago my

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,870
partners and I were onboarding into the

19
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:01,170
Canadian medical program and trying to

20
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,820
find a way to to get in get more

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,618
information about the appropriate

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,769
products we should be using how we

23
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,650
should be dosing and what we can expect

24
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,530
from the outcome of our treatments and

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,710
we found that we looked at literary

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,478
reviews we spoke to our doctors we spoke

27
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,989
to clinics and other care givers and

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,319
there was no data available so so we set

29
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,149
forth to to build that data set and

30
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,250
we've done that in Canada in North

31
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,770
America and we're actually here having

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,930
great discussions with a number of

33
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,469
people in the German and Swiss market

34
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,460
about ways we can apply our our approach

35
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:43,289
and and what we predominantly do is

36
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:45,839
we've developed a mobile app that allows

37
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,570
patients in Canada to track their

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,920
interaction with lab verified products

39
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:55,139
so we do this across 350 different

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,659
medical conditions and we analyze their

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,629
response to Canadian registered products

42
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,750
so this give us has given us a preview

43
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:07,488
of of a lot of consumer and patient

44
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,770
behavior and observational use over a

45
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:13,360
two-year period of time so it's it's

46
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,130
quite quite enlightening and

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,410
and especially for the medical audience

48
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,509
so all of our data is crowd-sourced

49
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,370
that's gathered from patients we also

50
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:23,649
have a community where we support

51
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,020
patients for discussions that are hard

52
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,719
to have on Facebook and that rolls up

53
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,909
into an analytics platform and the data

54
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,849
that we collect from this platform is

55
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:36,819
used by retail pharmacies across Canada

56
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,849
to provide prescribing guidance when a

57
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:42,219
patient calls in so it's based on the

58
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:46,120
large cohort data that that we produce

59
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:49,180
in the app we've been fairly successful

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,969
in our mission so far we've gathered

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,189
over 1.2 million patient interactions

62
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:58,240
this is on a platform that's hip-hop

63
00:02:54,189 --> 00:03:00,539
HIPAA and HIPAA compliant and we're

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,909
probably the largest medicinal

65
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:06,879
observational data set in the world and

66
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:09,930
what we do is we provide this tool to

67
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,479
physicians to researchers and clinicians

68
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,120
to help them to identify what is working

69
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,009
and what is not so that's that's kind of

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,769
a background of how I arrived at this

71
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:23,919
table I have a different view of medical

72
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:26,830
patients it's based on statistical and

73
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,018
choral Ettore analysis and what I'd like

74
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,910
to do is is give everyone else the

75
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,870
ability to introduce themselves in a

76
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:37,299
similar fashion so in in order of the

77
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,969
slides I'd first like to you to

78
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,450
introduce dr. Fran drew Franjo Croton

79
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:47,259
Herman who is very well known amongst

80
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:49,268
this crowd he is the executive director

81
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:53,949
of the International Association for

82
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:56,620
cannabinoid medicines ICM in Germany he

83
00:03:53,949 --> 00:04:00,429
is also the chairman of the Association

84
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:04,060
for cannabis as a medicine in Germany

85
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,830
and he is also a a medical practitioner

86
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:20,319
so let me hand it over to Fran Joe to

87
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:24,430
introduce himself very good so I have

88
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:27,040
only two slides I don't know if you know

89
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,569
the legal situation in Germany it

90
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:36,900
exactly and I thought I would like to

91
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:40,180
introduce it first this is a slide on

92
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,069
the prerequisites for reimbursement for

93
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,209
cannabis medicines by a German health

94
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:48,849
insurers and this is also kind of a

95
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:51,299
guideline for German physicians in which

96
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:56,620
transitions they prescribe cannabis and

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:58,240
there are three prerequisites first the

98
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,120
patients have to suffer from a severe

99
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
disease sometimes there's discussion

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,949
between the physician and the health

101
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,800
insurer if this is severe for example

102
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:11,800
they have to Shoreham a arguer while he

103
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,120
is able to work so the disease is not so

104
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,189
severe the second veracruz it is that

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,769
there that a generally recognized

106
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:24,910
medical standard treatment is either not

107
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:26,919
available or cannot be applied on the

108
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,790
reasonable assessment of the treating

109
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,530
physician and the third which is very

110
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,560
interesting interesting or important

111
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:36,279
which when it comes to research or the

112
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,899
available data

113
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:46,049
is that there is a founded chance or a

114
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:48,819
kind of justified chance of a noticeable

115
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,000
positive effect on the cause of the

116
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:54,370
disease or unserious symptoms and the

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,500
latter requirement is fulfilled if there

118
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:01,740
is scientific research supporting this

119
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:04,149
chance it is not necessary that there is

120
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,540
that there are large clinical studies

121
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:10,689
with 200 or 300 patients it may be

122
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,280
sufficient that is for example for

123
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:15,819
Tourette Syndrome we have only very

124
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:20,379
small studies 1020 people but to read

125
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:25,889
system Tourette syndrome is accepted so

126
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:30,569
it would be interesting to have research

127
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:35,319
with 20 or 30 people 20 or 30 patients

128
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:38,019
in these disease where we have nearly

129
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,769
nothing today I give you some examples

130
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:50,659
please next slide

131
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:53,478
ah sorry I give you some diseases which

132
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,910
are promising but currently unresearched

133
00:06:53,478 --> 00:07:04,939
and the number of people suffering in

134
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:09,939
Germany with this disease for example we

135
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:15,740
have about 2 million people with ADHD

136
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:17,899
above the age of 18 the current

137
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,500
guidelines for treatment of ADHD in

138
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,810
Germany say don't use cannabis they

139
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,430
explicitly say that you should not use

140
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:34,509
it we need some more data to show it is

141
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:38,569
effective at least in some people autism

142
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:41,960
we have no real good medication to treat

143
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:44,900
autism no good standard medication to

144
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:49,158
treat estate but cannabis often is

145
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:52,968
helping and we have about a half million

146
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:56,389
people in Germany suffering from autism

147
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:59,418
and there is no absolutely no clinical

148
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:01,908
research for ADHD we have at least one

149
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:04,549
clinical study conducted with the

150
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:10,418
cannabis sector Sativex in the UK what

151
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:13,310
with autism we have nothing depression

152
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:17,180
we have good antidepressant medications

153
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:20,810
but 1/3 or 30% of patients do not profit

154
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:24,189
from standard medication so if we have

155
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:28,009
3.5 million patients with depression

156
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:31,430
there would be about 1 million depressed

157
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:36,288
patients who do not get sufficient

158
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:38,959
relief by standard medication and there

159
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:43,158
is no research there's some research on

160
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:46,549
reactive depression in in cancer for

161
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:49,250
example but with neurotic depression or

162
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:51,078
major depression we have nothing post

163
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,360
about a stress disorder we have some

164
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:57,349
research on it but

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,379
we should have more obsessive-compulsive

166
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,909
disorder we have nothing we have a few

167
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:05,750
case reports for example from the

168
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:06,829
charity in Berlin here 1.4 million

169
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,889
people suffering from

170
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:13,610
obsessive-compulsive disorders these are

171
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:17,299
not always severe cases but as in any

172
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:24,079
case any disease you have light moderate

173
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:26,269
and severe conditions psychiatric

174
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:27,588
conditions are usually under researched

175
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,500
when it comes to cannabis

176
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:33,170
this has tradition because psychiatrists

177
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,379
often are very reluctant when it comes

178
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:38,870
to the medical use so we have to do

179
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:42,350
research in this area of psychotic

180
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:47,120
conditions because the patients are

181
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:50,209
suffering many of them do not get enough

182
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,789
relief from standard medication and for

183
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:55,039
the companies this is also a market if

184
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:57,740
you say it in other words for the

185
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:01,699
patients it's a need for the company is

186
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:06,350
the market and for researches it is a

187
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:09,980
must do we have many physical conditions

188
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,019
where we do not have much on research

189
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:17,629
for example I see patients with acne

190
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:22,669
inversa it's not well known and research

191
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:25,159
an unknown disease suffering more than

192
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:29,809
half a million people in Germany alone

193
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:32,539
and we have no good medication they are

194
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:35,989
usually undergoing surgery once a year

195
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:37,730
or something just a headache we have

196
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,480
something with migraine but we have

197
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,000
nothing with customary hyperhidrosis

198
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,949
I have several peoples with hybrid roses

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,480
severe hyper-v doses there are three

200
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:52,250
grades from light moderate to severe and

201
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,560
I have patients who have undergone

202
00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:01,399
surgery to treat their hyper two doses

203
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:03,919
of the arms and the hands and they kind

204
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,870
of is at least in some people works well

205
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,149
you do not have think research so we

206
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,759
don't know the person

207
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:12,100
age of people who may profit from a

208
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:16,169
treatment cannabis what I can say at

209
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:19,440
least some people profit very good

210
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:25,019
Crohn's disease or bowel syndrome

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:28,110
tinnitus when it comes to research

212
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:31,949
example with another and researched

213
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:34,330
condition which is restless leg syndrome

214
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:37,420
with restless leg street or some wrong

215
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:41,259
you see also see that it is not only

216
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:43,779
about THC and this is may be true for

217
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,939
other indications so it may be

218
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:53,079
reasonable for example to have a three

219
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:56,880
arm research one arm recibo one arm an

220
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:02,860
indica strain one arm sativa strain or

221
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:08,919
one arm CBD THC strain and one the THC

222
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:12,279
strain the example is the following four

223
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:16,929
weeks ago I had a patient with restless

224
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:19,000
leg syndrome treatment resistant to

225
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,739
standard medication she went to the

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,679
Netherlands to try cannabis it worked

227
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,419
very well she she came back some months

228
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,689
later she had an appointment in my

229
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:29,259
practice and I told her well in restless

230
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,590
leg syndrome

231
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:35,019
I usually prescribe indica varieties but

232
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,360
they were not available you know the the

233
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:40,360
problems with getting enough cannabis to

234
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,050
Germany and I prescribed a sativa

235
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,340
stranger and three days later she was

236
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:49,000
read the pointer said it does not work

237
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,590
and meanwhile the indica strains were

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,720
available I've prescribed integer strain

239
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,850
and some days later she said I have the

240
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,060
same effect as with the cannabis in the

241
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,659
Netherlands I could sleep like a baby so

242
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:00,659
thank you

243
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,460
alright thanks for having me my name is

244
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,470
dr. Tim Shue

245
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,990
my background is veterinarian I'm from

246
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,360
California prior to starting my company

247
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,180
vet CBD I practice in general emergency

248
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,000
critical care medicine and the reason

249
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,219
why I find a vet CVD in 2015 was because

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,929
as a health care practitioner I believe

251
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,090
we have a moral and ethical obligation

252
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:32,699
to pursue all potential courses of

253
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,830
therapy for our patients and my approach

254
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,690
is that if cannabis has potential

255
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,270
therapeutic benefits then we owe it to

256
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,160
our patients and the pet owners to be

257
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,259
able to pursue those therapeutics and

258
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,909
even if cannabis doesn't have any sort

259
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,200
of therapeutic benefits we need to find

260
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,870
that out we need to make that

261
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,040
information available to pet owners so

262
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,169
they can make the best decisions for

263
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,199
their pets the reality is that for

264
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:57,120
animals the lifespan is a lot shorter a

265
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,430
lot of patients don't have time to wait

266
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,659
it's now or never so from the time that

267
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,969
we bring them home when they're puppies

268
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,679
in the blink of an eye lifetimes passed

269
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,620
by before we know it we're saying our

270
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,539
good-byes and so in 2015 I retired from

271
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,710
practice and start a vet CVD so that way

272
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:12,959
we could provide cannabinoid

273
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,519
therapeutics for animals and the things

274
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,350
that we've used it for for the past four

275
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,329
years for thousands and thousands of

276
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,000
patients across California are primarily

277
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,480
things like pain anxiety inflammation

278
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,799
nausea seizures and cancer and a lot of

279
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,470
people may be familiar with using

280
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,539
cannabis or CBD for dogs but we also use

281
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:35,129
it for cats we use it for horses

282
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:37,439
guinea pigs rabbits rats pigs ferrets so

283
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:39,210
you name it the reality is that all

284
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,430
vertebrae animals have endocannabinoids

285
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,040
systems and they do stand to benefit

286
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:46,709
from cannabis therapeutics you know a

287
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,539
lot of people talk about THC and they

288
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,210
don't know about that's used for THC in

289
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,309
animals but we do use THC in animals

290
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,190
it's not just CBD we do use

291
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:59,069
full-spectrum products that include THC

292
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,990
we also look at CBC CBG really when we

293
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,370
approach cannabinoid therapeutics the

294
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,230
reality is that the endocannabinoid

295
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,480
system was only discovered in the 90s

296
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,980
and so as a field of medicine we're

297
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,110
really just scratching the surface and

298
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,850
ultimately my goal is to be able to

299
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,620
integrate cannabinoid therapeutics with

300
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,330
veterinary medicine so that way we can

301
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,769
benefit our patients we can provide them

302
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,749
quality of life and

303
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:33,928
we can provide sustained value to those

304
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:39,019
pet owners hello everybody I'm a senior

305
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:43,769
scientist from volcanic centre Israel em

306
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:47,928
I'm a a head of a lab in Vulcan II which

307
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:52,499
is a governmental Research Institute and

308
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:59,458
in my lab we are focused on cannabis

309
00:15:52,499 --> 00:16:03,480
studies a we are involved with the

310
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:09,088
process that Israel is going now of this

311
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:13,110
reform of medicalization we're with the

312
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:17,549
other national bodies like the Israeli

313
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:22,199
gene bank we form genetics collection of

314
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:24,980
seeds of genetics that is the national

315
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:29,928
collection of Israel and will serve

316
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:32,428
growers and scientists for the further

317
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:37,159
developments of this field we

318
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:42,208
characterize this a this collection and

319
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:44,999
however the main activity in my lab is I

320
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:48,628
think what might be the major challenge

321
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:50,939
that we face in this field of cannabis

322
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:53,879
for medical use and this is the

323
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:57,509
generation of head of evidence-based

324
00:16:53,879 --> 00:17:01,999
medicine and this is what we are focused

325
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:05,548
on in my lab we ask what are the best

326
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:09,209
mixtures of active cannabis compounds

327
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:13,168
for optimize treatment for different

328
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,169
medical indications or conditions to

329
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:19,139
answer this particular question we have

330
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:21,720
a very small farm for research purposes

331
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,729
only we develop different extraction

332
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,490
protocols or use different extraction

333
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,649
protocols we do deep chemical analysis

334
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,960
we see far and beyond

335
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:32,058
THC vers

336
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,950
Zippity but rather we look at many

337
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:39,038
different cannabinoids terpenes

338
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:41,720
flavonoids whatever varies we a do

339
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:46,519
separation of day of the compounds and

340
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,710
ven examine in different bio essays that

341
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:52,700
reflect at least to some extent

342
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,370
different medical conditions we are able

343
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,370
to identify the compounds and the

344
00:17:55,369 --> 00:18:03,288
compositions and then taraj effect that

345
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:06,199
we have heard about a these days we are

346
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:10,129
able to identify these compounds with

347
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,890
act together for optimized treatment of

348
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:17,510
patients we work with physicians from

349
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:21,460
hospitals in Israel and the information

350
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:25,038
that we find in our studies is being a

351
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,440
now developed by commercial companies a

352
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:32,528
two products that are going into

353
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:38,210
clinical trials in hospitals in Israel

354
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:40,548
so just in briefly let me take you as to

355
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:46,519
the future at least as the way which we

356
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:49,700
see it in a cannabis for medical use so

357
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,769
we all start from from weeds and

358
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,100
satifying in dicovered we heard about

359
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:58,879
quite a lot and from different strains

360
00:18:55,099 --> 00:19:02,859
or cultivars but we heard about by

361
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:07,090
conducting bioassays we identify

362
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:11,750
synergies between cannabis molecules

363
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:14,528
these synergies of course by also

364
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,528
biochemical analysis leads to

365
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:20,960
formulation of active pharmaceutical

366
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:24,740
ingredients or active plant ingredients

367
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,860
all derived from cannabis but we are

368
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:32,149
able to determine what the formulation

369
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:35,678
of active compounds is we look for

370
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:41,269
targets and mode of action of these

371
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:43,350
specific synergistic api and then by a

372
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:47,519
process of development being

373
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:50,189
by our commercial collaborators that

374
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,650
include different steps of regulation

375
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:56,370
and development of drug delivery which

376
00:19:52,650 --> 00:20:02,130
is also highly important with that we

377
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:05,609
are able to to promote and to bring we

378
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:09,360
believe new generation of cannabis based

379
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:16,229
products for medical use those that will

380
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:19,619
be based on API on synergies and will be

381
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:28,798
standardized for optimal and specific

382
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:33,359
use for a patient's thank you I'm trying

383
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:35,788
to steal her mic so we've had a lot of

384
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,949
discussion about the ways that that

385
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:41,669
cannabis can be used to treat things

386
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:44,610
like IBS Crohn's disease depression

387
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:46,679
we've heard about its use in in animal

388
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:49,288
and veterinary care and we've talked

389
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,740
about isolating cannabinoids and

390
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:56,759
terpenoids that morally more closely

391
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,980
approximate a molecular drug so one of

392
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,829
the things that that I think is

393
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,259
necessary as the as the industry moves

394
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:06,449
forward and as cannabis develops into a

395
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,960
medicine is to understand those

396
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:12,480
interactions and the entourage effect

397
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,960
because it's it's the seclusion or

398
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,538
preclusion of certain elements within in

399
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,700
a strain that actually will dictate the

400
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:25,048
way that it that interacts with the

401
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,360
human body and as fragile had mentioned

402
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:29,519
there's very very big differences

403
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,099
between the people will respond from

404
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,429
strain to strain in terms of the Israeli

405
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:37,319
approach we're looking at isolating and

406
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:40,470
reconstituting product for test within

407
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:42,210
market and and in order for doctors to

408
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,370
be comfortable of with it this is at

409
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,370
least something that we see in the

410
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:49,619
Canadian medical program is is that you

411
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:52,769
need to be able to talk the language or

412
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:55,109
the rubric or lexicon that the doctor is

413
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,789
used to prescribing against and because

414
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:59,549
this is an evidence-based

415
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:01,349
daddy a lot of physicians these days at

416
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,899
least from what we see at strain Grant

417
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:05,819
are reticent to prescribe because they

418
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,690
don't have the the data of that

419
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:11,069
molecular drug there there's also a gap

420
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,650
that we see in terms of their

421
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:16,980
understanding of the application of

422
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:20,910
cannabinoids for various therapies so

423
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:24,480
maybe I can ask Franjo what what are

424
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:27,779
some of the gaps that you see in in

425
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,920
terms of our knowledge for treatment in

426
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,920
inpatient years

427
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:39,089
well let me say one word on the history

428
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:41,819
of modern cannabis research which

429
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:47,250
started with clinical studies the first

430
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:49,289
was conducted in 1975 all clinical

431
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,920
studies on the medical use of cannabis

432
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:56,639
in different diseases has been initiated

433
00:22:52,920 --> 00:23:02,430
by patients patients went to their

434
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:06,270
doctors at a university and if they were

435
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:10,350
lucky this doctor found it very

436
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:12,389
interesting this experience and he asked

437
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:16,829
other patients if they had similar

438
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:19,310
experiences let Mesa gave the example of

439
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,309
Tourette's syndrome

440
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:23,879
Studies on dread syndrome have been

441
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:27,359
strong ducted at the medical school of

442
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,080
innova because there we have a professor

443
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:34,079
dr. Kestner Laval who was told by their

444
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:37,939
patients in the 1990s if we take

445
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:40,529
cannabis we have relief of our symptoms

446
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,380
then he made the first study with one

447
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:46,500
patient the second party study with ten

448
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:51,180
patients one day studies then a study

449
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:56,369
was for use a few space patients over

450
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:59,490
time of four weeks this has could could

451
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:03,229
been have happened also to patients with

452
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:06,450
other diseases it is important that at

453
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,890
hospital doctors or doctors listen to

454
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,950
their patients

455
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:13,290
and don't say this is not possible we

456
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,509
have no clinical data we have to gain

457
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:18,509
clinical data

458
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:21,390
my first patient with hyperhidrosis who

459
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:24,390
use cannabis and was successful and met

460
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:27,470
in five years ago before I did not know

461
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:30,950
that cannabis may work in high doses

462
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:34,380
then I wrote a very short piece in a

463
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,450
journal journal journal and I got

464
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,310
feedback from other patients said I am

465
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:42,140
also suffering from Pedrosa's I am

466
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:45,750
profiting from it so what we need is

467
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:48,690
doctors at last hospice hospitals at

468
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,390
universities who listen to their

469
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,390
patients who tell them incredible

470
00:24:51,390 --> 00:25:01,340
stories about what can cannabis can do

471
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:03,630
and and then to start research

472
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:07,019
unfortunately research is rather

473
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:09,630
expensive so if there is an interested

474
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:12,960
doctor at the University he will usually

475
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,810
only be able to do an open study with

476
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,620
ten or twenty people and they will not

477
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:23,339
be able to carry out large studies so

478
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:25,559
what is necessary that companies and the

479
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:31,740
scientists at university come together

480
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:36,450
to look what can we do to profit the

481
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:39,630
patient the doctor the industry great as

482
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:43,769
I guess as a follow-on I'd like to ask

483
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:46,560
the same thing of Tim you know we see

484
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:48,539
that a lot of people in in in terms of

485
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,279
prescribing for their pets they really

486
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,799
do think of them as extensions of the

487
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,289
families so you know we hear stories of

488
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,769
people putting their dogs on Prozac or

489
00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:02,450
on on cardiovascular heart drugs to

490
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:06,230
extend their life also dealing with pain

491
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:10,529
you know we've seen applications for

492
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:12,690
PTSD depression anxiety what what type

493
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:15,000
of things are you seeing in terms of

494
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,730
veterinary medicine and and the approach

495
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,430
is that you're taking using cannabinoid

496
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,778
therapy yeah I think some of the things

497
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,849
that are uniquely challenging

498
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:26,278
when it comes to the medical aspect of

499
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,658
cannabis is that it's it's very

500
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:28,888
backwards a lot of times when we're

501
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,509
looking at other therapeutics other

502
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:32,158
drugs you know we tend to have these

503
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:34,169
clinical trials that are established and

504
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,599
then what happens is the patient's

505
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:38,879
benefit afterwards but cannabis coming

506
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:40,888
from a black-market essentially what

507
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:42,898
happens is now the market becomes the

508
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:44,459
driving force and the science and the

509
00:26:42,898 --> 00:26:46,678
medicine take a backseat and have to

510
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,899
play catch-up because the market will

511
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,609
operate whether it's a black gray or

512
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,228
legal market the market will always be

513
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:54,569
there and it will continue to operate

514
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:56,848
now the reality is when the market is

515
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:58,259
black or gray the scientific in the

516
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,569
medical aspect of it are going to be

517
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,058
unable to operate and so what we see is

518
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:04,798
that we see in terms of the real-world

519
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:06,210
evidence we see a lot of patients using

520
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,979
it for all sorts of different things

521
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,358
we see a lot of case studies that have

522
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:12,058
been successful for things like pain

523
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:14,218
anxiety inflammation whether it's

524
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:16,678
allergies our autoimmune diseases nausea

525
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:18,778
seizures and cancer but we're seeing a

526
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,690
lack of complete clinical trials and

527
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:23,819
clinical evidence because of the market

528
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,129
that we have to operate in that's really

529
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:28,200
really unfortunate and veterinarians is

530
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:31,528
especially in America are in a unique

531
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,028
position because across America veterans

532
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:35,098
are actually not allowed to discuss

533
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:37,739
cannabis with their clients so something

534
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:40,499
that's potentially beneficial or even

535
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:42,269
life-saving for their clients they can't

536
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,829
even discuss that now California has

537
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,659
changed a little bit because last year

538
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,759
we helped get a bill passed called a b2

539
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,649
to 1/5 that allows for California

540
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,749
veterinarians to discuss cannabis with

541
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:53,699
their clients so first bill of its kind

542
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:55,950
in the country and hopefully it leads

543
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,808
the way for people to be able to discuss

544
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,769
this with their veterinarians because if

545
00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:00,418
they're not hearing it from their

546
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:02,519
veterinarians they're our primary source

547
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,659
of medical information what happens is

548
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,128
they're going to go on the internet

549
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,869
they're gonna you know google these

550
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:08,579
symptoms and find out you know what it

551
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:09,928
may or may not do and a lot of times

552
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:11,579
this information could be false or

553
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,899
inaccurate they're asking friends or

554
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,338
family when they really should be

555
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:17,668
talking to medical professionals about

556
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:19,259
this unfortunately when it comes to the

557
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:22,009
endocannabinoids system and cannabinoid

558
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:24,989
therapeutics in general the the medical

559
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:26,999
teachings are far behind so when I talk

560
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:28,739
to a lot of veterinarians they don't

561
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,419
know about the endocannabinoids system

562
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:33,509
they don't know about endocannabinoids

563
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:35,020
and so you can just imagine if you went

564
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:36,339
to your doctor you went to your

565
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,079
veterinarian you asked them about the

566
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,939
endocrine system you asked them about

567
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,589
you know what insulin does for your body

568
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,539
you know what happens if you have low

569
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,799
levels of testosterone or estrogen and

570
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,750
they threw up their hands and say I

571
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,460
don't know how would you feel as a

572
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,079
patient how would you feel if that's

573
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,460
what your medical professional said and

574
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,289
that's the reality of what we're dealing

575
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,759
with a lot of times these veterinarians

576
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:56,170
or physicians they say I don't know

577
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:57,940
because they're not being taught this

578
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,610
material in school and this information

579
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:03,190
isn't being made available to them again

580
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:05,409
partially because of the legal blockades

581
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,029
that are involved here and so this is

582
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,920
the problem that we're seeing is a lack

583
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:10,089
of education and this is one of the

584
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,830
things that we're focused on is

585
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,689
educating veterinarians and veterinary

586
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:14,980
clients to be able to have this

587
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,009
education so that they can make informed

588
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,079
decisions about their health care that's

589
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:21,940
really wonderful

590
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:24,899
one of the things that they that we're

591
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,670
looking at is is building custom

592
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,590
solutions for custom disease states so

593
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,630
we're we're looking at isolating

594
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:35,589
compounds so that we can deliver next

595
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:37,660
generation proper pharmaceuticals and

596
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:40,240
and this is something that that

597
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,890
underneath is doing in Israel so maybe

598
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,019
you can tell us about what you think are

599
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,540
some of the biggest opportunities for

600
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:51,690
development and exploration based on

601
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:56,529
your view of cannabis I would like just

602
00:29:51,690 --> 00:30:01,299
first to say a few words about the the

603
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:04,389
issue of fail of education and what I'm

604
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:07,559
involved with in Israel in the frame of

605
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:11,250
the Ministry of Health is the teaching

606
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:15,730
medical personnel physicians nurses

607
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:19,450
pharmacists about cannabis and it's so

608
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:25,150
interesting to see how a stigmatized

609
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:31,630
this subject is nevertheless the stigma

610
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:34,780
is being slowly being reduced and and I

611
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:37,000
think and I completely confer to what

612
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:43,000
you said this is a matter of Education

613
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:46,210
of really a educating the personnel the

614
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,130
medical personnel on cannabis and on the

615
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,549
different properties

616
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:54,990
so I definitely agree with that's

617
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:58,000
wonderful say so that's that's one a

618
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:01,769
taking the same line answering your

619
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,250
question a what I think the main

620
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:09,220
importance here is to close the gap that

621
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:13,750
we have today between the the current

622
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:15,789
knowledge of what we know about cannabis

623
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,829
on their different compounds on don't

624
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:23,440
rush affect and the actual compounds

625
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:26,199
that are working together or separately

626
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,900
for different medical indications I

627
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,819
think that for my experience at least

628
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:38,550
that many of a of the physicians the

629
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:43,259
doctors are having a real problem to

630
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:48,190
recommend a patient to smoke a joint

631
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:51,160
okay to do get better if we do not see

632
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,110
that as a treatment as a medicine and

633
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,900
this is you know I think it's not just

634
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:58,209
in Israel but I think North America

635
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:01,420
shares a similar view towards smoking

636
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,430
and as a non-medical form most

637
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,670
physicians that I talk to will prefer

638
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:10,690
that people use an oil or use an edible

639
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,550
or or vaporize using a device because

640
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,039
obviously it's not good to combust and

641
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:18,159
you get all the the other bad chemicals

642
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,960
in along with the good chemicals exactly

643
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:26,279
and not just that this is not a medicine

644
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:30,190
agreed so a so here first of all

645
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,849
specifying what what compounds are the

646
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:36,039
the the active ones this is so important

647
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:38,019
definitely for treatment and also for

648
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,089
the physicians for their medical

649
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:44,440
personnel to accept cannabis as a

650
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:49,949
medicine that's one and then two is the

651
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:54,789
delivery the method of delivery which

652
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:59,259
should be much improved no doubt from

653
00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:00,029
smoking to actual products that have

654
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:05,549
certain

655
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:09,389
a formulation high bioavailability high

656
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:13,740
absorbance dosing these should be dosed

657
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:16,590
III agree so one of the things that that

658
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,750
is is needed when when we're looking at

659
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:23,069
this as a medicine is is the concept of

660
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,319
transparency and standardization because

661
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:27,000
if you are gonna take it from a dried

662
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,939
flower and you're gonna render it down

663
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,450
into isolates that are reconstituted or

664
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,519
formula or formulated you you need to

665
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:38,309
deliver an experience that is going to

666
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,559
be the same every time and that's that's

667
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:44,369
what it's going to take for it to you to

668
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:48,480
be well understood but what we're seeing

669
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:51,179
in studies from ones like in Israel that

670
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,660
that daddy Miri had done on cancer cells

671
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,880
where he looked at six hundred you know

672
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,820
cancer cells and subjected them to six

673
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,350
hundred different strains of cannabis to

674
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:03,569
identify one that stopped the tumor

675
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:05,669
growth if we if we're gonna have to do

676
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:08,069
trial and error testing like that it's

677
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:11,220
it's it's unfortunately prohibitive and

678
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:13,050
and time constraining so a lot of what

679
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,059
we need to do to get our knowledge up to

680
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,660
par is done through observational

681
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:20,279
science because like it or not this is

682
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,500
not a drug that's coming to power

683
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,950
through through clinical trials it's

684
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,659
been brought in by government and and

685
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:31,199
constitutional rights around around the

686
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:35,909
world so perhaps I can I can turn it

687
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:38,849
back to to dr. Franjo to ask you about

688
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:41,759
what your experience is in the German

689
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:44,429
market and and what changes that you've

690
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,650
seen in your practice over the years

691
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:49,799
that you've been involved in in

692
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:53,570
prescribing as I understand you look at

693
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,570
a number of advanced cases

694
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:05,860
we all we all were surprised that the

695
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:08,909
number of patients are increasing so

696
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:11,890
quickly in in Germany it is clear that

697
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:13,989
usually one or two percent of the

698
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:16,329
population in industrialized countries

699
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:18,279
need cannabis as a medicine we see that

700
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:21,759
from Canada Israel and Netherlands that

701
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:26,769
it will be one or two percent also in US

702
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,470
states and I was aware that this will

703
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:32,860
also come to Germany so we expect to

704
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:37,059
have eight thousand eight hundred

705
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:40,510
thousand or 1.6 million patients in

706
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:43,929
Germany in the future currently we have

707
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:50,190
about 40,000 patient patients and it is

708
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:55,079
creasing very quickly and doctors

709
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:58,510
politicians are just currently realizing

710
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,329
that cannabis as a medicine is not an

711
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:04,000
exception to compared to standard

712
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:10,920
medication but that it is a very an

713
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:15,219
important medical treatment a good a

714
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,260
good medicine and the number of doctors

715
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:19,750
are also increasing we know it from

716
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,520
other countries that its first there are

717
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:25,840
very few physicians who are ready to

718
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:27,340
prescribe it and that's what's happening

719
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,230
in Germany there are few paid through

720
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,530
physicians and the development is

721
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:37,599
quicker than we thought that physicians

722
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:41,200
are ready to do it even against the

723
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,549
obstacles by the law it's not so easy to

724
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,549
prescribe cannabis in German in

725
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:49,390
physicians do it anywhere for their

726
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:51,159
patients and the number of patients are

727
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:54,940
increasing quickly and the number of

728
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:58,179
doctors also but of course there is much

729
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:02,200
uncertainty what is he described here as

730
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:04,769
a chance that cannabis is so diverse and

731
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:09,460
we have different strains and batches

732
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:11,108
for a beginner this is a confusion

733
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,440
and it makes it not easier but more

734
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:16,769
difficult that is the reason why many

735
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:22,420
physicians adopted in Germany start with

736
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:26,739
dronabinol only THC or with standardized

737
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,950
extracts and what we have to do is to

738
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:34,379
give them education so that relay regard

739
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:37,689
the different portents the different

740
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,900
possibilities of cannabis treatment as a

741
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:44,619
chance and not as a threat or as a

742
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:49,450
confusing issue I talked about indica

743
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:53,380
sativa or CBD THC patients want to find

744
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:55,358
their strain which works best and they

745
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,660
want to have it standardized that--as

746
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:01,358
get the all of the same strain and

747
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:04,000
physician physicians have to understand

748
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:07,838
that cannabis is more than thg and

749
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,030
regard this as a chance to find a better

750
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,480
treatment for the doctors we need

751
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:18,940
education we need standardization and we

752
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:23,889
need clinical research thank you so Tim

753
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:25,539
with standardization research what what

754
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:26,889
what are you seeing in terms of

755
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:28,929
veterinary science is there

756
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:32,199
standardization we're seeing pet foods

757
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:34,719
we're seeing hemp products what what

758
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,649
type of products are being frequented by

759
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:40,058
pet owners in California and for what

760
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,960
yeah so like I said before you know

761
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:46,630
primarily what we see is tinctures oral

762
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,599
based medications we definitely do not

763
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,980
have pet smoking or vaporizing so I just

764
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,440
want to make sure everyone's aware that

765
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,568
I get that question all the time please

766
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,700
don't have your pet smoke that that's

767
00:38:55,568 --> 00:39:00,460
not enjoyable do not hotbox your dog

768
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:03,399
please don't that's coming from a

769
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,068
veterinarian but yeah we use it for pain

770
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,260
anxiety inflammation nausea seizures and

771
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:10,119
cancer like I said before now the unique

772
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,970
thing about cannabis is that it's an

773
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,059
incredibly complex plant there's over

774
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:18,730
500 pharmaceutical components of the

775
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:21,579
plants the endocannabinoid system is

776
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,630
infinitely complex the cb1 receptors we

777
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:22,840
used to think that they were only in

778
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,309
this

779
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,140
nervous system now we know that they're

780
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:28,389
found all throughout the body same thing

781
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:29,409
with the cb2 receptors and even when

782
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:31,269
we're looking at the cannabinoid

783
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,759
receptors in human studies they've shown

784
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:36,250
to have genetic polymorphisms what that

785
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,230
means is that your cb1 receptors may not

786
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,630
be encoded as the same as the person

787
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,699
sitting next to you so cannabis the way

788
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,349
it works on your body is it may not be

789
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:46,449
the way that it works on your neighbor's

790
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:48,519
body and so we think that that may be

791
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:51,339
the case in animals also because we do

792
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,989
see variations in dosing protocols so

793
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,300
you know we could have a 70-pound dog

794
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:57,279
that uses a for epilepsy that uses a

795
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,380
higher dose than another one that uses a

796
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,090
much lower dose and one may need it

797
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,160
three times a day the other may be able

798
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,329
to use it just one time a day so that's

799
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,429
some of the difficulties that we're

800
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:09,250
encountering is that you know it's hard

801
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:10,659
to standardize dose for each individual

802
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:14,139
patient when we know that there can be

803
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:16,179
so much differentiation you know CBD the

804
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:18,219
molecule works on over 40 different

805
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:19,659
molecular targets you know has a very

806
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:21,549
weak affinity for the cb1 and cb2

807
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:24,129
receptors and so this is something that

808
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,810
it shows you just how complex it is

809
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,730
and we're trying to get a clearer

810
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:30,219
picture of it but it's going to take

811
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,530
time and you know in the meantime the

812
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:34,899
the mantra of starting low and then

813
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:38,080
gradually titrating up to the effective

814
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,210
optimal therapeutic dose is is good

815
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,960
advice not just for people but also for

816
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:47,349
animals so that's that's good advice in

817
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:51,369
in any time using cannabis start go low

818
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:53,409
start low go slow so one of the one of

819
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:57,909
the things that we've just been asked is

820
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:59,500
to open up the floor to questions let's

821
00:40:57,909 --> 00:41:02,519
hear it again for the panel first of all

822
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,519
let's ask the Krays

823
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:14,798
hi my name is tamas Garlin you have a

824
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:17,260
question too fragile so when your claim

825
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:22,059
is or when you say well okay there must

826
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:27,549
be more doctors to support this and need

827
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:33,609
to be educated when I saw a video or a

828
00:41:27,548 --> 00:41:37,869
report on German TV were the the the ax

829
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:38,440
the comma you know the the the cocl

830
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:41,650
sukima

831
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,659
has been strongly kind of very

832
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:47,139
controversial and against you know

833
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:50,409
supporting cannabis maybe you can tell

834
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:53,969
me you know how how's the strategy to

835
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:57,129
really break brick out of the wall

836
00:41:53,969 --> 00:42:00,578
because you know this is this is a lot

837
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:02,769
of effort without you know with maybe

838
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:06,359
you look just a little effect today you

839
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:14,650
know with a lot of effort on your side

840
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:18,900
that's my question well what we see

841
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:23,019
today is that every doctor is somehow

842
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:29,440
finding his own way to treat their

843
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:32,259
patients for example a colleague in in

844
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,720
my in the board of directors of the is

845
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,450
a.m. and the ICM is also a german doctor

846
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,439
at a university and we recently talked

847
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:44,500
together and found out that we have the

848
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,809
same idea of the usefulness of cannabis

849
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:51,039
as a medicine but we have different

850
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:55,420
approaches and this was a reason why we

851
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:57,220
decided to have a panel of doctors at

852
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:01,450
our next is same conference which will

853
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:05,318
also be in berlin where doctors tell the

854
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:08,048
audience what is their approach it's

855
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:11,380
it's we need education this is one one

856
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:13,929
thing what we also have to realize that

857
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:17,260
it is difficult to get different

858
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:20,169
approaches it is physicians i use

859
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:26,320
to give single molecules for example

860
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:29,829
tthe and or standardized extract

861
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:32,140
stresses sativex it is for example from

862
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:35,650
the EXA comma they are more supporting

863
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:37,179
these efforts and sometimes are saying

864
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:42,039
that cannabis louse is a kind of

865
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:46,649
middle-aged medicine and so this is the

866
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:50,199
flowers may be regarded as a threat to

867
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:53,410
usual therapy and we have to change it

868
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:59,379
that it is a chance to a better

869
00:43:53,409 --> 00:44:03,190
treatment yeah if somebody's asking me a

870
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:05,410
doctor in Germany how can I start the

871
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,630
treatment then I usually say you may

872
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:10,809
start with THC or standardized extracts

873
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:13,780
and if you have more experience then you

874
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:17,049
can change to a cannabis flower perhaps

875
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:19,690
to get more effect than with THC pref

876
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:24,340
lesser side effects or better effects

877
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:27,389
and so so we need education but every

878
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:31,630
doctor also have to make his career his

879
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:35,349
experience his own education with the

880
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:38,470
interaction of his patients and this

881
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:40,630
makes cannabis somewhat special because

882
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:43,179
other medicines you bring it to the

883
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,160
market and you say you start with five

884
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:48,309
milligrams then go to ten milligrams

885
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:51,819
this always the same way with cannabis

886
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:54,190
it's not always the same way I am sure

887
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:57,430
that I have different ways than many

888
00:44:54,190 --> 00:45:01,920
other doctors and that's what we try to

889
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:06,368
bring to to doctors that there is no one

890
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:10,990
golden way to treat patients with

891
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:11,858
cannabis based medicines we have time

892
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:14,349
for one more

893
00:45:11,858 --> 00:45:15,759
sure hey I'm Greg from the UK kind of a

894
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:17,559
social clubs that leads me perfectly

895
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,600
into my question actually but we do have

896
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,429
a one-size-fits-all medical cannabis

897
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,150
products available in the UK called

898
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:24,940
Sativex

899
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:27,039
it's labeled as having X amount of THC

900
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,659
and X amount of CBD in it but we all

901
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,889
know that it's got it's a full plant

902
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:33,019
extract it's got all the flavonoids and

903
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:35,449
in there as well and you know in

904
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:37,340
Esther's and so isn't it a little bit

905
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:38,419
insincere that we're you know labeling

906
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,370
up well you know talking about and

907
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,780
creating these medicines with just THC

908
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:43,849
and CBD in it when they do have all

909
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,980
these other drug interactions because if

910
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:49,009
I boy if I take two other strain two

911
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,960
strains similar to tgw have four sativex

912
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,930
and say well this one produces an almost

913
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,090
pure THC complex tract this one produces

914
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:57,980
an almost pure CBD extract I'll never

915
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,510
mix them together to get the the ratio I

916
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,030
need and then I'm going to give it to

917
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:04,370
people I could you know if the guy Oh

918
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:08,269
takes two strains he's got over in in

919
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,069
San Francisco the only two got to keep

920
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:11,300
it easy on this one if you take two

921
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,890
strains you've got over there that you

922
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,120
know make that high THC in high CBD

923
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:15,469
you're still going to get a different

924
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:17,750
reaction from the strains that I'm going

925
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:19,579
to make that you know from the home yeah

926
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,380
we're not you know when we're talking to

927
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:23,599
government ministers and politicians and

928
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,280
and and journalists they're very

929
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,869
confused by this because they're like

930
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,630
well know what the pharmaceutical

931
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:31,159
company is this is just THC and CBD so

932
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,780
its leaves people like me you know an

933
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:35,329
activist patients I'm being denied a

934
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,880
prescription in the UK now and I've got

935
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:39,710
Crohn's disease and it leaves us in a

936
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,510
really bad situation because people want

937
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,329
to follow the science and who seems to

938
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,800
be the most educated on this when we're

939
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:47,989
actually we've got a lot more experience

940
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,910
in it I've got six strains on I work for

941
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:53,029
my condition the different symptoms that

942
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:55,309
I need to function on a daily basis so I

943
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,720
can't be turned around and told no you

944
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:58,610
can't grow your own you're gonna have

945
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,439
one of these available from you know

946
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,059
from one of these companies and you're

947
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,530
gonna suck it up and deal with it so

948
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,969
that's not really working for us so we

949
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:07,430
you know we're pushing for the right to

950
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:08,269
grow at home and I just I just want to

951
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:10,159
know where do you think that actually

952
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:11,329
fits in in this or blight interim period

953
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,129
before we've actually got any of these

954
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:15,349
products we're all talking about one day

955
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:17,450
making and for people like me you know

956
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:20,829
should we do criminalize for people to

957
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:20,829
be able to grow in Europe as well

958
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:35,349
I think you touch here a very important

959
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:39,909
point of the somewhat superficial a view

960
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:43,659
that most have only on cannabis and I'm

961
00:47:39,909 --> 00:47:47,889
including pharmaceutical companies

962
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:52,089
talking only on THC in CBD in a in an

963
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:55,480
extract is superficial view you have so

964
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:58,600
many other compounds molecules in these

965
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,719
extracts and they're so important and

966
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:04,000
may change so much the outcome I just

967
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:06,849
want to share with you briefly just one

968
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,199
of the observations that we had in our

969
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:15,539
studies we work on a IBD inflammatory

970
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:19,149
bowel diseases and we examine in our

971
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:22,210
systems in collaboration with Mayer

972
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:25,590
Hospital in Israel we examine the effect

973
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:29,199
of cannabis extracts fractions and

974
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:36,340
compounds on alleviation of colon

975
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:39,549
inflammation we see that that it's it's

976
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:43,200
you can you can imagine the extract like

977
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:47,050
like like a pile of LEGO building blocks

978
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:49,839
we see that when we choose some of the

979
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:53,740
building blocks and put them together we

980
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:56,680
can get efficacy which is 20 times

981
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:59,949
higher you see what I'm saying

982
00:48:56,679 --> 00:49:04,179
you just pay by taking the right

983
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:06,659
building blocks okay so this is just one

984
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:11,829
example to the point that you touched

985
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:14,649
that we need to know so much more on

986
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:18,819
cannabis and need to know to choose

987
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:21,880
better day the compounds let them work

988
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:25,120
together to get much better effect and

989
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:28,329
you can I think if it you but you can

990
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,389
imagine that different diseases should

991
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:34,150
be treated very very much specifically

992
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:35,650
