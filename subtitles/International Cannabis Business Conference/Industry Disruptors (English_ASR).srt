bit about that too how the Cannabis

industry is actually being disrupted and

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,140
disrupting I guess well my name is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
Debbie Goldsberry I've been in the

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,058
Cannabis industry for 30 years I'm the

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
CEO of Magnolia Wellness dispensary in

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,899

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,579
officer for High Fidelity dispensary in

18
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,140
Berkeley please come visit we have a

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,840
vape lounge at Magnolia so you can

actually try the samples if you want

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,440
um

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,820
I have been a disrupter from day one the

23
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,339
first thing we had to do of course is

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,500
disrupt prohibition we had to tell the

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,079
DEA and the police and the elected

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,299
officials that this is a democracy the

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,739
voters run the Democracy that the

28
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,319
government's supposed to make laws based

29
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,419
on facts and Science and when they don't

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,579
we the people take charge of the

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,519
democracy and on cannabis prohibition

32
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,920
they had failed us epically and in fact

33
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:14,459
prohibition was illegal and our Acts

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,379
were what needed to be done to as Jack

35
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,599
Herrera said so eloquently all those

36
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,819
years make sure that hemp can save the

37
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,319
planet so I've been very excited to be a

38
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,339
part of this movement

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:30,118
um my own activism I've ran two local

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,859
marijuana initiatives I ran a recount if

41
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,140
you ever get a chance to demand a

42
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,060
recount it is just as fun as you can

43
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,519
imagine to demand a recount we won the

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,320
recount we did a referendum in San Jose

45
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,019
when they passed a law trying to make

46
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,118
marijuana dispensaries illegal we did a

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,519
referendum you know if the city passes a

48
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,759
law you can undo that as a citizen using

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,219
the referendum process I was subpoenaed

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,099
by the feds to test testify against Ed

51
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,319
Rosenthal in his federal trial and

52
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,919
refused went to federal court in front

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,898
of Judge Breyer who said

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,700
the refusal is

55
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,978
has been brought into my core with such

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,959
dignity and care and we can see that

57
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,000
when people have strong views of these

58
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,219
intense issues that they can come into

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,560
federal courts and make their case in a

60
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,080
way that's intelligent and comprehensive

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,840
and matters and he congratulated us and

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,360
rather than making us testify set us

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,259
free that was incredible

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
um

65
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,000
I opened my first dispensary Berkeley

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,800
Patients Group in 1999 when it was the

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,219
right thing to do not the legal thing to

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,599
do and now at Magnolia Wellness I've

69
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,759
been involved in a turnaround project

70
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,199
for those people in the industry you

71
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,419
know our industry is 20 years old in

72
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,659
California people like me if we've made

73
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,518
it this far it's been tough and we're in

74
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,620
debt and we've struggled and a lot of us

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,140
went to jail and we've suffered we

76
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,239
probably all have post-traumatic stress

77
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,339
disorder from having to fight the feds

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,620
and fight our government and deal with

79
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,439
our families and face the stigma of the

80
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,580
Cannabis prohibition all these years

81
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,620
um

82
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,019
cannabis can help with that hell yeah

83
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,159
smoke them if you got them not here

84
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,379
um

85
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,180
so at Magnolia I've been involved I took

86
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:13,919
over Magnolia if you want to get in the

87
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,360
Cannabis industry in California now at

88
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,639
retail really the only way in is

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,140
Acquisitions I took over Magnolia like

90
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,119
one of the many dispensaries it was

91
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,098
seven figures in debt I've been working

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,900
on a turnaround project there so close

93
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,878
so close can't wait to finish this

94
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,319
turnaround project and start sleeping at

95
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,658
night again

96
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,719
um and uh we'll get there there's a

97
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:35,519
strain for that um and uh and and look

98
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,378
I'm still on the mission hemp can save

99
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,599
the planet and I know we're all here for

100
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:40,859

101
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,840

102
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,220
30 years and yeah we're building a

103
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,019
business but we're also building a

104
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,239
community and we really are trying to

105
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,939
make nicer a nicer Society through the

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,799
legalization of cannabis so with that in

107

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,840
farmers in the Emerald Triangle so uh

169
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,400
that was you could say I'm second

170
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,698
generation

171
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,138
um I I before we got started this panel

172
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,759
I really felt like I wanted to just

173
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,620
identify like what what does it mean to

174
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,780
be a disrupter it's a buzzword in the

175
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,660
industry in here in San Francisco and

176
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,698
and in the.com world and in Silicon

177
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,220
Valley it's definitely an overused

178
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,660
buzzword so what does it mean for us in

179
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,600
the Cannabis industry and for us as

180
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,979
individuals to be disruptors well when I

181
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,479
was a hippie kid I got kicked out of the

182
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,159
Waldorf School and I got kicked out of

183
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,019
the other hippie school because I was

184
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,620
always a disruptive child and I learned

185
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,060
the value of uh of attention through

186
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,500
disruption now maybe that wasn't the

187
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,300
most positive thing because it ended me

188
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,360
up in public school where I learned

189
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:52,439
discipline but it's a valuable lesson in

190
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,000
in how uh we can challenge the status

191
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,100
quo of what's going on in any given

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,899
moment and then all of a sudden divert

193
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,840
attention to what we're doing cannabis

194
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,459
in itself is a disruptive industry right

195
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,500
we have disrupted the world and it's

196
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,239
such a tremendous fundamental basis from

197
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,100
the alcohol industry from prohibition

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,939
from legality from conservative uh uh um

199
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,220
agendas

200
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:17,418
from from what law enforcement has been

201
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,280
telling us from misinformed propaganda

202
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:22,318
cannabis turned that entire world on its

203
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,899
head so we every one of us every one of

204
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,460
you is a disrupter by just being a part

205
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,779
of this and that's part of the reason we

206
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,339
love it we're excited about it because

207
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,659
it's Purpose Driven purpose-driven

208
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,939
Brands purpose-driven businesses

209
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,680
purpose-driven Industries are creating

210
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:38,759
change and people love being a part of

211
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,579
change so by its very nature being a

212
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,580
disrupter it's it's valuable for us to

213
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,779
be involved in and it's exciting for us

214
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,098
to be involved with this because we're

215
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,500
challenging the way things work because

216
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:52,259
the way things were were wrong and we

217
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,120
all agree about that so

218
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,860
um but now we're in the situation we're

219
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,538
inventing a new industry in a world that

220
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,098
never existed really before because it

221
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,560
had been driven in the in the black

222
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:04,139
market and

223
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,240
now we're disrupting ourselves if you

224
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,400
look at what's happening in various uh

225
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,598
you know how many small Mom and Pops do

226
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,758
you know that are out of business right

227
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,918
now because things have changed so much

228
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,720
the way things were we're becoming an

229
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,899
internally disruptive industry within

230
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,699
itself and uh this is presenting new

231
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,679
challenges for every entrepreneur and

232
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,379
business person and Venture as big money

233
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,120
and big multi-state operators and hugely

234
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,580
capitalized businesses are starting to

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,680
crush a lot of the smaller brands in

236
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,299
smaller businesses there have that

237
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,278
disruption is causing people to need to

238
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,740
consolidate come together and bond is

239
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,479
and and and create kind of in uh

240
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,759
collectives and communities through

241
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,700
distribution networks or what have you

242
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:48,120
so there's I have so much to say on this

243
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,940
matter and I'm looking forward to this

244
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,519
panel with these incredible people but I

00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,338
really have a lot of killer brands that

254
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,919
you represent and you're doing a great

255
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,360
job getting them seen in the industry

256
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,679
um who are you representing how do you

257
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,080
do it and how are you guys being

258
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,479
disruptive over there

259
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,980
great well we are like I said we're the

260
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
premier creative Agency for Canada's

261
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,940
Adventures we've launched and taken to

262
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,240
Market some of the biggest brands in uh

263
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,459
here in California especially uh in uh

264
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,680
January our agency was acquired by

265
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:40,919
kushco Holdings previously Kush bottles

266
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,620
uh which has really empowered our agency

267
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:46,799
to create our dream of being the

268
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,360
international cannabis agency so we want

269
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,458
to basically understand what marketing

270
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,800
and compliance means in every existing

271
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,899
and emerging cannabis Market

272
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,599
globally to where when people are ready

273
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,220
to take their brands Global uh we're

274
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,800
obviously the agency to go to because we

275
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,480
truly know what that means on a cultural

276
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,439
level as well as a legal compliance

277
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,120
level

278
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,100
I you know one of the brands that we

279
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,839
work with is bang one of the sponsors of

280
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,278
this event and I and I take my hat off

281
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,080
to them because they were disruptors in

282
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,759
the very beginning when nobody was was

283
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,800
becoming multi-state when nobody

284
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,958
actually was being bold enough to be

285
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,819
re-licensing their their brand across

286
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,838
state lines bang was already vastly

287
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,700
ahead of it and that's part of the

288
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,100
reason they've become such a a household

289
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,420
name in the Cannabis industry one of my

290
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,879
other clients that I would say has done

291
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:33,059
a fantastic job of being disruptive is

292
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:36,299
Canada craft uh absolute extracts makes

293
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:39,719
a a bond agreement with Lagunitas they

294
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:43,979
come out with two products one is a line

295
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:48,180
of of cannabis extracts that are infused

296
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,680
with uh with um hop terpenes right so it

297
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,419
tastes like you're vaping an IPA there's

298
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,039
no alcohol in it they're bringing that

299
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,419
terpene profile flavor into the

300
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,179
experience and then on the opposite side

301
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:00,000
they're using cannabis terpenes to make

302
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,620
an IPA taste like uh to taste like

303
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,440
cannabis that's Innovative see that's

304
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,919
really the root of what disruption means

305
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,959
it's Innovation it's not novelty I would

306
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,479
say things like double barrel is is

307
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,819
novelty it's tchotchke it's okay fine

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,339
cool take two things make them work

309
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,660
together but true Innovation is taking

310
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,459
something completely different and

311
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,679
changing the Status Quo but it is a

312
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,599
perfect example fitting that that Niche

313
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,979
that needed to be fit finding that spot

314
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,139
and then changing the industry and

315
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,480
dominating their portion of the market

316
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,879
so for us everything at the root of what

317
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,500
we do is in strategy

318
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,078
there's plenty of good looking Brands

319
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,958
out there if you are a high quality

320
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:42,539
brand or a consistent brand then you are

321
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,119
what we uh that's what we call a minimum

322
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:47,639
standard how are you going to radically

323
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,799
differentiate your brand and and as we

324
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,179
call it zag in the industry it's where

325
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,679
you're not another sheep in the herd

326
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:55,139
because your main competitor is not

327
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,199
another cannabis brand it's brand noise

328
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,759
it's brand clutter and so what we do as

329
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,800
a creative agency through all the

330
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,720
variety of full spectrum tools from web

331
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,979
development to design marketing

332
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,500

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,039
introduction

361
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:06,419
um that is far more than I deserve

362
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:09,120
um I hope very much that uh there will

363
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:12,240
be there will be more movement

364
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,100
um by traditional institutions into into

365
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,500
the Cannabis industry

366
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,440
um they're

367
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,539
I I disagree on where the

368
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,120
the actual

369
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:27,240
um motivation comes for for them staying

370
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,980
out of it having worked with with quite

371
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,820
a few Financial Services firms in the

372
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,980
past

373
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,079
um I am aware of the the conservative

374
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,600
nature of it and for good reason they

375
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,359
they want to make sure that these stable

376
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,980
um that the economy remains stable and

377
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,680
is something that is available to

378
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,800
everybody and if there are situations

379
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,559
that cause them to shut down they don't

380
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,199
they don't want to have that happen

381
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:55,199
and there are opportunities uh for them

382
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,759
to to do well in this industry there's

383
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,519
also opportunities for them to fall into

384
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,139
pits with this industry so there are

385
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,519
there are a lot of things that need to

386
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,139
change

387
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,320
um in order for them to get comfortable

388
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:11,839
with it and we are working towards

389
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,820
pushing them towards accepting more uh

390
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,920
being able to use our services to accept

391
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,700
more cannabis

392
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,699
accounts

393
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,259
I

394
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,399
um

395
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,500
following Zach is just really it's it's

396
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,820
hard look I wanted to put the Charming

397
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,078
marketing guy first because I didn't

398
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,560
realize he was going to intimidate thank

399
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,299
you is the number one most pain in the

400
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,979
ass problem it's the reason behind all

401
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,439
of the crime all of the all of the

402
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,240
challenges all of the all of the dark

403
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,459
side of cannabis comes from from banking

404
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,919
so to be to be willing to tackle and

405
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,599
jump on something like that and and take

406
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,000
that on as the focus of your business to

407
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,399
me feels like it's bold it's Innovative

408
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,259
and therefore should you be the one

409
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,799
that's successful highly disruptive

410
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:03,360
whoever cracks this code is going to be

411
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,559
the one that like saves the day for the

412
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
industry

413
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,638
um I think we've cracked it

414
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,980
um so this is my background actually is

415
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,839
financial services law I was with sidley

416
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,220
Austin for several years in their

417
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,420
financial regulatory group out in New

418
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,560
York City

419
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,198
um I worked for Bessemer Venture

420
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,879
partners and legal and operations

421
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,458
um I this is my second fintech actually

422
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:27,419
my first fintech was an online hedge

423
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:29,578
fund investment it platform this was

424
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:32,399
back in 2011 before that space got

425
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:34,620
crowded uh we we did fine in that but

426
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,940
nobody invests in fintech frankly

427
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,980
um it's just not one of those spaces

428
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,959
where where institutional investors like

429
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,120
to invest I'm sure that that's a

430
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,000
familiar thing that many people in this

431
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,339
industry have also had to deal with is a

432
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,539
lack of institutional support

433
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:54,060
um banking itself is a challenge there's

434
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:57,299
a lot of regulations around it and doing

435
00:15:54,059 --> 00:16:00,059
it wrong you go to prison period

436
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,799
and it's one of those things where

437
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,138
people also don't recognize that

438
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,778
payments is another space that you can

439
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,339
you can get into pitfalls with and there

440
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:10,679
are technologies that are usable for

441
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,720
this our our banking industry see I

442
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,638
would I would argue that our our product

443
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,980
is less

444
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,079
um it's less disruptive for this space

445
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,539
it's just frankly a necessity for this

446
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,159
space and more disruptive for

447
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:25,919
traditional banking services and

448
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:29,039
traditional payments this is a rail that

449
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,838
frankly could replace ACH it could

450
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,059
replace fed wire you're seeing that

451
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,040
actually in a lot of locations across

452
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,419
the globe and the US has actually been

453
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,278
very slow to adopt Financial

454
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,860
technologies that could be very

455
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,480
attractive for Banking and and frankly

456
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,639
are no-brainers when you start actually

457
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,980
looking at the technology themselves and

458
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,539
what they're currently using but our

459
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,480
disruption the disruption that we

460
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:54,000
provide is and as you can you can tell

461
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm really a background person I'm

462
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,919
disrupting things on the B2B side I'm

463
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,879
interested in providing the the options

464
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,740
for people to use as an alternative to

465
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:07,679
bank owned rails

466
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,519
or federal government-owned rails this

467
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,319
is a it's it's something that

468
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,000
provides an additional layer of security

469
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,740
because you don't end up being closed

470
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,220
out of the system which is controlled

471
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:24,240
frankly by a few small not small large

472
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,459
but just a few corporate players and

473
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,359
it's you know the the ugly truth about

474
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:33,360
this is that the majority of uh State

475
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,579
Banks and smaller institutions Regional

476
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,459
Banks they're licensing their rails from

477
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:41,699
the larger institutions and that means

478
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,100
that they have to be careful what they

479
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,840
do they want to support the industry

480
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:48,538
they do most of them are affected by

481
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,599
this themselves but they also have to

482
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:53,038
comply with both both regulation of

483
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,699
course but I think that the government

484
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,759
has been more supportive to trying to

485
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,440
bring financial institutions on board

486
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:04,619
and the the financial institute the

487
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,840
financial industry itself has been

488
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:10,678
um very

489
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,519
uh cautious in moving in because they

490
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,679
are

491
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,298
it's a circular argument you guys are in

492
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,860
cash so it means you're more likely to

493
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:18,418
money launder and we don't want to be

494
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,399
handling money laundering but it's like

495
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,600
okay well but the the cash piece the

496
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,880
only reason why we're in cash is because

497
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,798
you guys refuse to bank us and so this

498
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,900
this ends up being the sicular yeah

499
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,058
exactly this this silly argument that

500
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,620
frankly has this circular format to it

501
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,379
that that really doesn't have a whole

502
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:37,139
lot of logic and it is fixable and

503
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,840
frankly I I put it upon the

504
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,580
the financial institutions themselves it

505
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,759
is their responsibility within our

506
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,859
society to actually monitor these

507
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:50,099
transactions that that they have a

508
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:52,798
privileged place in our society and they

509
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,480
need to live up to that privilege

510
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,859
so that that is what we're trying to

511
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,660
help them do get them more comfortable

512
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:58,859
with it and also get them more

513
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,840
comfortable with financial technology

514
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:01,918
that they are also not really that well

515
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,298
up on

516
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
Ashley

517
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,980
um Green Market Bay together

518
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,660
Green Market Bank is focused on

519
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,038
providing business banking services to

520
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,720
the marijuana industry tell us a little

521
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,558
bit about that what is it that you guys

522
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,660
do

523
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,279
so actually Green Market Bank was my old

524
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,558
trade name while I was learning this

525
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,178
industry I knew that I wanted to solve

526
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,099
the banking problem I knew that there

527
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,660
was a problem with payments as well and

528
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:26,099
was trying to take a two-pronged

529
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,360
approach to the cash problem in this

530
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,959
industry

531
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,538
um

532
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,660
artery is our product

533
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:36,179
artery pay is our website

534
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,860
and what we are doing we are working

535
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,360
with banking institutions some of the

536
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:41,519
smaller institutions that like I said

537
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,319
have been Limited in their ability to

538
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,960
work with this industry because of

539
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,220
either lack of capacity or concern about

540
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,819
whether they were going to lose the

541
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,160
licenses on their ACH and fed wire rails

542
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:56,639
concern about whether they were going to

543
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,759
yes possibly get into trouble for for

544
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,440
working with this industry on a on a on

545
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,759
a legal basis although I think a lot of

546
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,179
them have sort of moved away from that

547
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,619
uh that expectation

548
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,179
um so we wanted to work with them and

549
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:13,099
get them comfortable with it and so what

550
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:15,298
we do is we do know your customer we do

551
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:16,740
anti-money laundering

552
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,538
um reporting all of this all of this

553
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,120
compliance that they have to do anyways

554
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:23,519
we do it ourselves it's an added layer

555
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,678
of compliance and then we provide this

556
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,079
back Channel separate distributed Ledger

557
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,120
we are using blockchain with smart

558
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,159
contracts there's no fluctuation in the

559
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,899
value of any of the contracts the

560
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,880
capital in is the capital out it

561
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,320
represents your contract to the

562
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,080
underlying dollars that are held in

563
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,700
trust on your behalf it is not there's

564
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,019
no Shenanigans

565
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,880
um we're not trying to build something

566
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,960
that is going to be

567
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,480
um

568
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,519
outside of the banking system we know

569
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,038
that we need their help there is no way

570
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,619
to do this without them like I said they

571
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,960
have they have a privileged place in our

572
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:59,759
society they are our transaction rails

573
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,000
and we need them to work with us in

574
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,798
order to make this work and so we we are

575
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,380
working with banking partners of course

576
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,538
I can't tell you I'm under NDA I can't

577
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,480
tell you who but we have banking

578
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:16,279
Partners here in California and they are

579
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,360
holding capital for our our members

580
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,819
they are

581
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,339
allowing us to handle the transactive

582
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,139
rails on that behalf but basically we're

583
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:28,439
PayPal on blockchain

584
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,299
it's a very simple system it's a ledger

585
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,720
that is closed there's no exchange

586
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:35,879
Trading but it allows transactions to

587
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,880
move seamlessly and instantaneously

588
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,860
using the newest and most secure

589
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,720
technology that's available for

590
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,939
transaction processing

591
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,100
it really is kind of the

592
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,200
it's a new age in financial technology

593
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:53,399
and the US will be adapting

594
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,600
a little more slowly than the rest of

595
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,019
the world that had some enabling

596
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,000
regulations come into play but they

597
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:03,538
they will eventually have to adopt this

598
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,240
TR this as well so our our disruption

599
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:08,519
may be more towards the banking industry

600
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,339
and more towards the credit card

601
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,740
industry than actually towards cannabis

602
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,959
because what we want to do as artery

603
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,839
implies is provide you with that

604
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,640
lifeblood and make make it safer for

605
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,038
everybody to transact in this space

606
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,900
transact with one another as well as

607
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,058
transact with your customer

608
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,559
thank you so much Ashley let's hear for

609
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:31,200
Ashley the passion that she's bringing

610
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:34,079
to this issue and I I cannot imagine how

611
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,360
difficult it is to be where you are

612
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,819
um so disrupting we're trying to

613
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,798
disrupt the media in marketing we're

614
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:43,259
trying to get ahead in the banking

615
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,538
industry and financial services we've

616
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,400
got so much that we have to do the next

617
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,919
speaker I'm going to introduce is Lance

618
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,700
Lambert he's the Strategic business unit

619
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,100
manager that's a mouthful by the way of

620
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,900
Boveda which I use on a regular basis uh

621
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,939
my dispensaries you know we have to keep

622
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,480
our cannabis fresh the product is

623
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,058
actually very Innovative and useful it

624
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,099
keeps the Cannabis just Shelf ready and

625
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:09,899
great for our consumers but he has a

626
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,879
background that's so diverse I mean

627
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,798
Lance comes from media over the past 12

628
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,960
years he's worked primarily in the.com

629
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:18,359
and digital media space he's worked for

630
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,179
several big companies including Scripps

631
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,319
the Cannabis and weed maps who is

632
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,700
actually the director of media

633
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,519
operations and the publisher of

634
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,679
marijuana.com he became a part of the

635
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,418
industry in 2013 really when he joined

636
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,519
up with the Denver Post where he was the

637
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,200
director of AD operations and the GM of

638
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,720
the Cannabis

639
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,440
um so Lance recently took over position

640
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,120
there Boveda tell us more about the

641
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,679
product about yourself about the

642
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,119
disruption that you're causing let's

643
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,620
hear it that title was so fun the

644
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,239
further I get my career the longer my

645
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,759
title gets I don't know what that and

646
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,679
sorry I lost my voice yesterday

647
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,298
um yeah so as far as disrupting it's

648
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,620
kind of funny that's that's been a

649
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:58,139
better part of my life for some reason

650
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:01,038
did spend several years in the digital

651
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,320
media space and uh you know was a part

652
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,240
of.com first started disrupting I'd say

653
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,819
with autotrader.com we decided to

654
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,220
disrupt a well chip Perry the founder

655
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:13,678
but we decided to disrupt the automotive

656
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,839
industry as far as uh how you find cars

657
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,100
uh that was the early years back when I

658
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,099
think Craigslist was the only option

659
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,658
outside of print Publications but then

660
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,240
yeah just continue that on in my career

661
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:27,360
and uh as far as disrupting in this

662
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,099
specific industry um it was interesting

663
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,178
I was working for Scripps media which

664
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,119
you all might know if you're familiar

665
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,860
with Food Network DIY those kind of

666
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,558
companies uh that's who I worked for and

667
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:40,319
then got called by a former VP to move

668
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:42,480
to Colorado and it was January of 2014

669
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,339
when I officially moved and as funny

670
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,079
being from Northern California

671
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:47,720
um from up by where the Waldo's came

672
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,399
from here in Marin County

673
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,019
and you know ivp said hey I think

674
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,940
there's a good opportunity here you know

675
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:56,279
Colorado happens to be legalizing

676
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,440
cannabis and I was like yeah I heard and

677
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,579
uh she's all you know you've done some

678
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,320
great things but we're launching a

679
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:02,759
website called the Cannabis I was a

680
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,939
brainchild of a friend called Ricardo

681
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,259
Baka who was my editor-in-chief and went

682
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,940
over there to head up media operations

683
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,619
but I was a guy behind the scene of the

684
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,298
Cannabis the way that that was a

685
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:14,879
disrupter to this industry and I'm not

686
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:17,099
knocking I'm friends the the media pool

687
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,840
as we call it in this industry is very

688
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,639
tight I mean we have a couple

689
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,918
individuals In This Very Room that are

690
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,299
in this uh in the space but we're all

691
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,880
friends and we all respected you know

692
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:28,139
while high times was uh Matt saying and

693
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,419
the crew were kind of more on the deep

694
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,700
end a little more cultural a little less

695
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,740
mainstream we did have other companies

696
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,900
like dope and Eugenio at cannabis now

697
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,700
and and the list goes on

698
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,559
but when we came along with the Cannabis

699
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,519
we wanted to take a different approach

700
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:47,038
we wanted to cover the industry from a

701
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,379
true professional journalism standpoint

702
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,179
uh we followed what was called spj or

703
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,100
what is called SBJ code of ethics a

704
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,360
society of professional journalists and

705
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,459
so we covered The Good the Bad and the

706
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,979
Ugly so when companies not naming any

707
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,079
names but that first year had a thousand

708
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,360
plants seized because of exposure

709
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:06,658
exposure to pesticides we covered that

710
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:09,000
when edible companies uh were off by I

711
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,159
don't know 90 milligrams of thcm what

712
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,900
was deemed 100 milligram bar we covered

713
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,360
that so we didn't necessarily make a lot

714
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,220
of friends but the people who were doing

715
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,839
it right in this industry respected us

716
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,220
because we were covering the good the

717
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,720
bad the ugly we were pointing out the

718
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,100
people that weren't doing it right and

719
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,500
weren't doing this industry a service

720
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,879
and then obviously rewarded and

721
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,159
complimented and covered the ones that

722
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,559
were so that was definitely a fun stint

723
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,659
did move on to become director of media

724
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,339
operations at Weedmaps and become

725
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,600
publisher of their subsequent news site

726
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,278
marijuana.com

727
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,139
I'd say another disrupter in the

728
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,298
industry uh love them or hate them they

729
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,559
they definitely have made quite a splash

730
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,319
in this industry they've been around 10

731
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:48,000
years is definitely a good ride and then

732
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,019
segued over which I think Debbie came up

733
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,700
to the boo she's like okay you're in

734
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,400
digital media and you're in.com and all

735
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,380
that then you came to Bovada it's like

736
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,700
well you know after weed maps I kind of

737
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,320
decided I want to be my own boss I'd

738
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,460
start a few companies so like this guy

739
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,558
over here has like you know I know

740
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,140
enough people in the industry you get to

741
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,058
know some key players and uh and so I

742
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,340
was going to go off on my own and uh

743
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:10,500
Bovada approached me phenomenal company

744
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:12,058
a huge fan of theirs they're similar to

745
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,980
other companies I work for where they're

746
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:16,678
an industry leader and a disrupt her in

747
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,360
their own right and um you might ask

748
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,340
what they disrupt so Bove what I'd say

749
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:23,158
you know slowly we're disrupting the

750
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:26,519
sales of tortillas of recycling orange

751
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,860
rinds and lettuce maybe some wet paper

752
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,480
towels if you're like me back in my

753
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:32,579
childhood years up here in Northern

754
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,798
California but really it is joking aside

755
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:36,298
you know the technology can be looked at

756
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,879
in many perspectives but really Bove it

757
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:40,200
as a 10 technology company and I compare

758
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,059
it I love speaking of metaphors and

759
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,620
analogies and this guy coming from media

760
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,899
will appreciate because that's how you

761
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:46,979
help people understand what you're doing

762
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,240
um but it's like taking your clothes

763
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,500
down to the river when you have a

764
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,480
washing machine in the garage like

765
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,880
seriously people it's time to get with

766
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,220
the tech put down the tortillas put down

767
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,159
the wet paper towels there's a there's a

768
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,278
safer way to uh to to not only store but

769
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,200
to carry your cannabis the industry as a

770
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:05,759
whole you know I'm a huge advocate I

771
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,100
don't consider myself an advocate I do

772
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,859
it activists it is more so an advocacy

773
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:13,740
of being cancer-free for 15 years I I

774
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:15,658
transition my life to being a True

775
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,400
Believer of holistic in eastern medicine

776
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,559
definitely believe that cannabis falls

777
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,600
under that but I'm a big fan of everyone

778
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:23,700
that is a disrupter and I agree I mean

779
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,379
you started touching on it but um

780
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,120
there's a lot of outside disruptors a

781
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,480
lot of inside disruptors

782
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,558
in but not everyone look underneath I

783
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,259
mean there's definitely sheep out there

784
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:37,259
I think a good example is everyone loves

785
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:39,419
talking about big Pharma big alcohol big

786
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,220
tobacco they're coming they're here they

787
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,900
own property and in all the prime

788
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,220
locations

789
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,679
um but it's interesting we're working

790
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,240
with someone uh most people might not

791
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,480
know but you may recognize a name

792
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,880
Adolphus bush who Adolphus Bush V

793
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,819
happens to be the great great grandson

794
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,799
of Adolphus who started a little company

795
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,658
called Anheuser-Busch they got bought

796
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,839
out by a company called inbev for

797
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:05,580
several billion dollars a few years ago

798
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,778
um you know when first hearing oh I'd be

799
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,278
possibly working with someone at Bush

800
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm not a big fan of alcohol I mean

801
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:12,000
don't get me wrong when I skim and hurt

802
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,039
myself surfing or something I I

803
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,480
definitely use alcohol but it's more so

804
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:17,579
topically

805
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,079
um but for anything both medical and

806
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:22,019
recreationally I'm more so a cannabis

807
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,519
guy but hearing his story in in hearing

808
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:25,440
this individual speaking he's like you

809
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,099
know what uh interesting thing happened

810
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,140
this parent company bought bought out my

811
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:33,240
family company part of the contingency

812
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,919
was that no Bush could work for

813
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,778
Anheuser-Busch ever again

814
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,919
so that's kind of an interesting fact so

815
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:39,898
don't think someone with the last name

816
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,419
bush is that big alcohol that's coming

817
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:44,639
in to besiege on our industry but number

818
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,500
two he pointed out an obvious which all

819
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,759
came together in conversation was he's

820
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,679
doing the same thing that his great

821
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,359
great grandfather did he's coming in

822
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,000
since he did get because he went through

823
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,099
college he he due process he tried to go

824
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,859
back to his family's former families

825
00:29:56,099 --> 00:30:00,778
company he went through the proper steps

826
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,119
to apply for a job they said nope the

827
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,919
the stipulation still stands no Bush

828
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,359
will ever work for this company

829
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,038
so what do you do he moved to Colorado

830
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,918
he started his own company in cannabis

831
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,480
and I'm like dude props to you ABV is

832
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,919
the company he started he's like I'm

833
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,079
doing the same thing my my great great

834
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,120
grandpa did and I think that is so cool

835
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,798
that you know if you look at things and

836
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,019
you just step back and look at not just

837
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,359
the trees but the force as a whole and

838
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:28,440
look at this individual as he's

839
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:30,658
disrupting 2.0 for a family and uh so

840
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,860
same thing I think with uh you know with

841
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,600
other aspects of the industry not

842
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:35,959
everyone in Pharma is bad Pharma not

843
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,519
everyone in tobacco is bad tobacco

844
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,000
we need to be open-minded and understand

845
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,740
that some things are inevitable and if

846
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,480
we want this it's a catch-22 we can't

847
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,399
have our cake and eat it too and I'm

848
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,120
like this guy I mean growing up in Marin

849
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:49,798
County

850
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,719
although I made fun of hippies because

851
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,980
the patchoulio always got to me but I

852
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,019
have a huge respect you know I've come

853
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,819
around to Hummus and 10 grain bread I

854
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,740
truly do have a respect for it but if we

855
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:01,019
want this to go mainstream we we need

856
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,359
the help and we need to find those those

857
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:05,158
partners and and get those alliances in

858
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,798
place but make sure that they carry

859
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,559
through the culture in the craft that

860
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,819
has been around for decades you know I

861
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,798
mean that's the thing that we really

862
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:15,658
need to be cognizant of no matter if

863
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:16,859
you're an activist if you're an advocate

864
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,559
or if you're just out of the Green

865
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,119
Closet like me it all matters and making

866
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:22,980
a difference in moving this industry

867
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,839
forward so all of us to your point we're

868
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,700
all disruptors in this room just for

869
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:29,538
being a part of this and maybe posting

870
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,640
up on social media that you came

871
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:34,679
I love it uh very articulate okay here's

872
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,020
a question you you come from this broad

873
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,700
perspective uh you're in consumer goods

874
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,798
right now you came from Tech how has

875
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,500
Tech changed the way the industry cures

876
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,839
stores and sells cannabis products

877
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:49,259
great question there you wrote thank you

878
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,759
so many different levels my gosh uh guy

879
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:52,980
long live the turkey bag that's one

880
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,480
thing I'm waiting for for change on but

881
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,740
we've done some extensive studies and

882
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,298
there's so much more to a turkey bag

883
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,339
talk about not taking a book by its

884
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:01,740
cover I get why so many of my friends

885
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:04,500
use them but a lot of the technology I

886
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,839
think I'd say one company just as an

887
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,880
example on the Cure side cure tube which

888
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,398
is an up-and-coming group out of San

889
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,840
Diego uh you know traditionally anyone

890
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,158
that knows or anyone that has friends in

891
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:16,980
the industry we talk about black and

892
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,720
yellows or hdx's or or totes or whatever

893
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,159
you want to call them but a lot of

894
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,519
people leave them when using turkey bags

895
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,320
store and totes they're not the most

896
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,579
advantageous way to go no matter if it's

897
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,319
curing or story and they're awkward

898
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,699
they're bulky you you load them all up

899
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,740
you load them all down never mind the

900
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,240
fact that they weigh several pounds then

901
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,940
these guys come along with something

902
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,259
that does make sense that's easier to

903
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,058
roll that's easier to check that's

904
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,038
easier to to

905
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:42,798
um to go through the curing process with

906
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,000
as far as venting and such and burping

907
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,740
and then they were smart enough to go

908
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,778
you know we want technology it matches

909
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,460
our efforts and created a tray

910
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,019
unbeknownst to us in the beginning and

911
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,940
by no means were reoffended it was kind

912
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,918
of cool they created a tray for Bovada

913
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,659
because they said you know again you

914
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,520
shouldn't be using tortillas to try to

915
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,700
bring up the relative humidity of your

916
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,099
flower I'm a purist my friends might

917
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,860
call me a can of snob I prefer the term

918
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:09,178
purist so I am very picky on what I

919
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:10,979
consume I want to know where it comes

920
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,778
from I want to know how it was produced

921
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,980
Etc I don't care about the race to the

922
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:16,619
top you can keep your Chernobyl and

923
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,079
Amnesia half of those 30 percent THC

924
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,819
ratings are [ __ ] anyway but the fact

925
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,740
of the matter is that they embrace the

926
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,879
fact that Tech exists in the last thing

927
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,500
that someone like me wants is

928
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,360
cross-contamination from something that

929
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,220
happens to be produced with yeast like

930
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,740
tortillas or something that has its own

931
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,600
respective terpenes like orange rinds so

932
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,519
I think that's very Innovative and and

933
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,959
definitely makes a difference when you

934
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,278
get into the tech side what some of

935
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,720
these companies are doing rather be

936
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,119
green bits

937
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,519
um you know or trees I mean the POS

938
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,839
systems are Next Level it's stuff that I

939
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,880
wouldn't have expected to see for

940
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,538
another several years I think the fact

941
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,580
that you know people like art View and

942
00:33:50,538 --> 00:33:55,379
and BDS analytics Roy's company are

943
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:57,298
saying hey this year in 2019 that's

944
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,000
going to be a 19 billion dollar billion

945
00:33:57,298 --> 00:34:02,038
with a B industry it's only going to

946
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,359
continue to grow it's nice that the

947
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:04,679
right people are coming in and taking a

948
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,298
chance I mean you guys don't realize

949
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,559
there's a lot of ogs in the room that I

950
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:09,418
see right now by the way which is cool

951
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:11,338
but some of you newer to the industry

952
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,858
those people are leaving some seriously

953
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:15,659
great opportunities and jobs and all

954
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:17,219
these guys get hit up I know I I don't

955
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,500
throw it out there people know I'm I'm

956
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,598
an advocate but when I travel and and

957
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,918
seriously I I'm a gen xer and my friends

958
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,720
are still like you're in cannabis why

959
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,460
are you going to South America why do

960
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,138
you go to Australia why do you go to

961
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,179
Europe like we do right it's like

962
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,159
because we're not the only ones U.S is

963
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,440
not the the number one in many things

964
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,579
anymore uh cannabis we definitely have

965
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,378
the culture and the craft and the

966
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,838
strains but my gosh the stuff that's

967
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:41,219
going on from a medical and from a

968
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,559
scientific standpoint in a little city

969
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:44,638
called Tel Aviv it's only 70 years old a

970
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,659
lot of people to know about bits in

971
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,720
Israel

972
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,659
um it is phenomenal we know about 435

973
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,039
strains or excuse me strains

974
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,260
cannabinoids Associated they're upwards

975
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,779
of 900. it's insane what they're doing

1008
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,440

Carlson

1017
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,279
um there's a whole bunch of different

1018
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,519
things that I get to speak about and I

1019
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,240
enjoy speaking about this stuff uh Laura

1020
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:50,820
Ingram it was a lot of fun so

1021
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,799
but one of the reasons that I'm here is

1022
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,660
I want to talk about the War on Drugs

1023
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,460
that's still going on

1024
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:58,440
this is something that's very near and

1025
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,599
dear to my heart because I was a

1026
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,519
prosecutor so when I was starting my

1027
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,160
career 20 years ago in the Brooklyn DA's

1028
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,980
office I was a soldier in the war on

1029
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,539
drugs and this is something that you

1030
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,699
know after a time and reflection and

1031
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:14,099
seeing what I saw I left it was one of

1032
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:16,500
the big reasons I left and I write about

1033
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,780
this stuff I wrote a post last year

1034
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,400
about Jeff sessions and going back to

1035
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,040
things and making him the most dangerous

1036
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,619
man in America earlier today they talked

1037
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,300
about the new attorney general soon to

1038
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,920
be Attorney General William Barr and how

1039
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,579
he seems to be a little bit you know

1040
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,260
better towards the drug world I'm not

1041
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,280
sure that's true I just think he's a

1042
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,599
more polished version of Jeff sessions

1043
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,099
there's still a lot of arrests all

1044
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,099
across this country

1045
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:46,460
you know involving marijuana and it

1046
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:49,680
shouldn't be

1047
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,059
the reason is that the DEA still has a

1048
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,980
marijuana schedule on drugs I don't know

1049
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,659
how many guys have ever seen this but

1050
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,460
I'm sure most a lot of you have but if

1051
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:58,679
you look what it says

1052
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,300
schedule one drugs substance or

1053
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,980
chemicals defined as drugs with no

1054
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,700
currently accepted medical use and high

1055
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:08,639
potential for abuse heroin and marijuana

1056
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:11,719
around there schedule Two drugs a little

1057
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:15,118
less severe include cocaine meth

1058
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:19,319
methadone hydromorphine

1059
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,838
for the oxycodone fentanyl thanks

1060
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,480
I mean this is amazing that this hasn't

1061
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,820
changed because the the law enforcement

1062
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,519
prosecutorial powers in this country

1063
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,338
keep it this way and they and they do

1064
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,259
that because you know we have a uh

1065
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:35,880
prison industrial complex in this

1066
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,060
country which I'll talk about show a

1067
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,880
little clip here right is El Chapo worse

1068
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,338
than El chapet I don't know I mean 150

1069
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,539
murders a billion dollars forfeited I

1070
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:47,400
mean and then when you talk about

1071
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:49,800
credibility which was your your original

1072
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,780
question you know do these guys have any

1073
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,119
credit building right I mean they are

1074
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,820
clearly here these are awful awful human

1075
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,800
beings and listen I've been on the I've

1076
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,320
seen this in court myself when you've

1077
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,940
had Witnesses way worse records than my

1078
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,160
client or the other defendants on trial

1079
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,838
you know in a white collar case so the

1080
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,578
guys who committed 10 times more fraud

1081
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,380
than the guys testifying against them

1082
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,940
you know the question is why is the

1083
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,140
government doing this and ultimately

1084
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,119
you're going to ask the question when

1085
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:17,338
history judges us you know it's a couple

1086
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,960
decades from now you know billions and

1087
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,659
billions of dollars spent on the War on

1088
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,760
Drugs was this worth it right if they

1089
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:26,279
had legalized this taxes and brought

1090
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,720
this and moved to erode the violence but

1091
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,820
you know we have a prison industrial

1092
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,199
complex in this country and that's what

1093
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,480
you know that's what this War on Drugs

1094
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,379
is really about and El Chapo is just you

1095
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,820
know the way for the United States

1096
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,440
government to say hey we got the big

1097
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,619
fish or one of them or everybody else

1098
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,559
will have them cooperate right

1099
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:47,119
so one of the things we provided in your

1100
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:50,338
bag is a little chart

1101
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,019
and it has where the basis you know

1102
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:53,900
where marijuana is from a legal

1103
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:56,400
perspective where it's been legalized

1104
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,440
decriminalized medical marijuana there's

1105
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,900
a list of all the states it's in your uh

1106
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,400
in the bag that they came in so take a

1107
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,460
look at that

1108
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,740
um you know that's uh pretty much it for

1109
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,460
uh for now

1110
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:13,379
uh question yes let's hear it

1111
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,059
you're on the East Coast things are so

1112
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,980
different we're here in California we've

1113
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:19,019
had a legal market for 20 years I mean I

1114
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,480
was just in in Boston I couldn't believe

1115
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:23,759
how alive and well prohibition is it was

1116
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,460
so frightening to see in these kind of

1117
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,440
new and emerging uh

1118
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,880
markets how far behind people are but I

1119
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,800
know you're you're a lawyer and you're

1120
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,720
before federal judges what are the

1121
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,579
judges thinking these days

1122
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,578
unfortunately judges haven't really

1123
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:40,380
changed uh judges are these are lifetime

1124
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,599
appointments Federal Court District

1125
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,539
Court judges so some of these guys have

1126
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,160
been on the bench for 20 30 years and

1127
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:48,659
they believe in the War on Drugs most of

1128
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:51,779
them were Federal prosecutors before

1129
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,098
they became judges and so this is what

1130
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,920
they're used to when you talk about the

1131
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:57,599
schedule one drugs that's built into the

1132
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,940
federal sentencing guidelines and how

1133
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,700
much time people are looking at so it's

1134
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:05,280
going to take a generational change

1135
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:07,439
before judges change

1136
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,760
generational change well we've only got

1137
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,440
one minute to accomplish that

1138
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,780
generational change that's not going to

1139
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,940
work okay look you guys would not

1140
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,579
believe how intelligent and dedicated

1141
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,559
this panel is and if you open up their

1142
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,480
brains like a file cabinet how much you

1143
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:23,400
can learn so I encourage you we only had

1144
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,440
45 minutes to talk about this incredible

1145
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,880
topic we can't tell you everything that

1146
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,099
we wanted to tell you during this amount

1147
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,900
of time so stop them in the hallways

1148
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:32,760
stop them outside stop them on their way

1149
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,960
out the room and ask questions and get
