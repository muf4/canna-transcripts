so we will be talking about

35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,118
how we use innovation technology and

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,579
research to improve cannabis

37
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,700
harnessing science and Ingenuity to move

38
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,978
the Cannabis industry forward

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,079
so the first question is what are the

40
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,000
main current challenges of the sector in

41
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,099
Spain and what are the challenges that

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,259
your companies and institutions like

43
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,899
Aptos Baden beta's research nature

44
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,759
Institute and fito blend

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,719
house as a company according to their

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,719
particular activities

47
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,639
Ruben would you like to start or yeah I

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,140
can do it okay thanks a lot like that

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,359
we're going to be here and it's a pass

50
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,519
for now to have a chance to show what we

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,560
are having here in Spain and basically

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,080
what we

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,719
we really have a problem with MEPS so

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,379
it's the urgency that it's complicated

55
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,780
to do the research up to an agency that

56
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,299
let us be really restrictive with all

57
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,219
the documentation it's really slow and

58
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,980
it's not as easy on any other country

59
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,719
especially like for example Portugal so

60
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,639
I would say like what if

61
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,859
the problem that we have is that we

62
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,799
would like to improve that and see how

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,360
we could unit forces to to research

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,360
together without that limitation

65
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:54,780
yes I agree as well I don't know I

66
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,900
cannot speak for Spain but International

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,780
it's very hard to exchange let's say

68
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,360
samples between the Laboratories or

69
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,580
other things because

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,940
even if there is small amount or even

71
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,300
standards for uh you know laboratory

72
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:15,300
they consider it as a illegal drug so

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,800
this should be changed and it was also

74
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,439
initiative from Israel from

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,439
because we should be able to cooperate

76
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,439
worldwide

77
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,019
okay from fito plan we have two

78
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:34,919
different kind of activities one of them

79
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,219
is a research where we generate general

80
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,419
knowledge and another one is

81
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:41,400
commercialize the knowledge that we

82
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,759
created before

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,039
um unfortunately uh the charging the

84
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,639
challenges are the same we have the same

85
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,598
problems uh and unfortunately is is the

86
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,119
amps so I mentioned when before

87
00:03:53,598 --> 00:04:00,419
from our point of view to the balance

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,900
correctly or activities both of them is

89
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,298
necessarily a speed up and improve the

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,299
channel communication with the amps

91
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:14,640
and of course is essential Harmony size

92
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:17,060
the rules into the different countries

93
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:22,159
in Europe because obviously we are

94
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,160
losing many business opportunities

95
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,600
yes definitely I agree with you guys it

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,280
looks like we've been here all morning

97
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,860
and we're all talking about the same

98
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:35,339
we're all having the same problems AMS

99
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,220
they are not regulating I'm I'm juancho

100
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:41,159
from Aptos we are a nutrient company and

101
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,259
talking from my side as I mean last year

102
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,199
we had a like 10 projects working here

103
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,419
in Spain this year is known we are

104
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,860
forced to go outside to work outside we

105
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:55,740
have to go to Portugal we have to go to

106
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,720
Uruguay Czech Republic I mean we should

107
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,699
unify this why why shall I go to

108
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,759
Portugal If it's my neighbor is just

109
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,919
here why I mean is this should have the

110
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,660
same rules and where Europe are we

111
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,000
Europe or what we should be we should be

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,919
ruled by the same

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,259
laws I believe but that would help us a

114
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,379
lot to work as a company to develop the

115
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,240
company we could create work and

116
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,379
possibilities and pay taxes in the

117
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,120
country I don't know why they don't see

118
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,918
the and they don't help us a little bit

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,560
more really

120
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,500
great so regulation is kind of an issue

121
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,839
right now also a little bit of this also

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,759
a little lack of the education also they

123
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,279
need also to help us to do a little bit

124
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,259
more of research you know to the

125
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,698
companies that want to to get ready for

126
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,840
this

127
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,020
right

128
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,299
um only one detail maybe I um I am

129
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:48,240
completely agree with you because uh

130
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,780
unfortunately we haven't uh the the law

131
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,538
that we need with uh the reality that we

132
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:57,599
have in Spain but I that I tried to

133
00:05:54,538 --> 00:06:01,560
mention before is that uh we need that

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,479
the agency has a very fast answer when

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,199
we try to

136
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:11,939
um asking for something and essentially

137
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,300
uh speed up the bureaucracy procedures

138
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,918
when we try to

139
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,199
maintain the license that we have

140
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,279
because the rules is very restrictive

141
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,280
but a seats

142
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:28,560
was one of the first companies

143
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,619
researching in Europe and it's something

144
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,660
special we've got lucky time ago to be

145
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,399
able to research on cannabis but right

146
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,560
now compared with Portugal Adventure

147
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,839
we're saying information just can give

148
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,319
you an answer in one two weeks Mbps

149
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:46,379
could take four to six months so how

150
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,660
you're gonna research in our industry

151
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,620
having that long time of reply so yeah

152
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,340
thank you

153
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,860
thank you well seeing this

154
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,899
um the next question is then how are you

155
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,080
making use of Ingenuity to push these

156
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,519
limits currently

157
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,839
so

158
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,478
um yeah

159
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,818
actually from the Cannabis Hub we saw

160
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,339
that we have a lack of Regulation into

161
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,139
the hemp inside Spain

162
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:16,198
France is really increasing the

163
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,740
production they already have uh more

164
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,740
than 18

165
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,978
000 hectares of crop and we don't have

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,199
we don't have any decorticator in Spain

167
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:27,598
and then we were looking why we have

168
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,199
that problem in Spain and what is going

169
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,598
on what happened we cannotch track so we

170
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,060
cannot extract once we grow even seeds

171
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,759
of fiber the biomass cannot be used so

172
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,860
for extraction usually Farmers they send

173
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,720
it to Germany or France or any other

174
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,660
place that they could extract

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,419
and furthermore we have all that issues

176
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,539
with some varieties than in our climate

177
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:54,538
are not really producing as we expect

178
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,740
and that we have the limitation on zero

179
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,259
three percent

180
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,439
we came with the idea inside the

181
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,419
Cannabis Hub to present the p l Bernardo

182
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,579
proposed it before and we were showing

183
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,620
them a bit how we could press the

184
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,598
government that they don't need to

185
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,300
change the law they just need to have a

186
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,418
different view about the hemp and how we

187
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,759
could be competent and related with

188
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,799
other countries so um what we are doing

189
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,620
we are just presenting a p l is a

190
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,020
proposal no law to change that rules

191
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,598
inside the hemp and being able to be

192
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:30,659
really productive here and have a chance

193
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,418
to to revolutionize the hemp industry

194
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:37,399
this is what we are doing

195
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:41,819
uh yes we are also now

196
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:43,860
somehow organizing uh cannabis Hub in

197
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,580
Slovenia or actually we want to connect

198
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,800
all the players in Slovenia for uh you

199
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,509
know quicker and better growth of

200
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,799
cannabis

201
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:56,039
[Music]

202
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:59,299
business but this field is also

203
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:02,039
important education and the quick

204
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:05,219
response or transfer the knowledge from

205
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:10,139
the research facilities to the industry

206
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,379
so all the uh you know stakeholders can

207
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,480
benefit from from this we have a lot of

208
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,958
knowledge

209
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,120
we have a lot of investors on this field

210
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:23,219
but all these things are I think too

211
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,100
much dispersed and we have have to

212
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,839
somehow bring them together for you know

213
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,600
benefit of it

214
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,760
yeah

215
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,339
from my point of view try to find

216
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,919
solutions to these issues is a little

217
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,360
bit complicated especially if we try to

218
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:45,240
to do something alone so for me the key

219
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,220
uh for solve these problems is the

220
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,379
collaboration because you know the

221
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,399
threats lies in the numbers

222
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,338
so

223
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,379
um for this reason for the plan uh

224
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:01,700
collaborate with different associations

225
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:05,458
satms in USA economics Hub here in

226
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:09,180
Catalonia we have created aikame the

227
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:11,639
first Association of companies with

228
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:15,299
authorization by the MPS for production

229
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,240
or for scientific purposes

230
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:21,899
um but I I think that the key is the

231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,320
collaboration and the change the culture

232
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,899
um from my personal point of view

233
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,600
um to change something is by the

234
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,839
education for that reason here in

235
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,019
Catalonia in the University of uh of

236
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,800
Catalonia we have created the first

237
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:44,578
master's degree noise is a postgraduate

238
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:47,458
course where we try to educate the the

239
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:52,620
new generation about the benefits of the

240
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:55,919
plants and how is using the law that the

241
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,159
very strictly loud that we have here is

242
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,799
possible work correctly with the plan in

243
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,338
all the possibilities that this amazing

244
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,338
plant has

245
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,078
necessarily with you basically it's

246
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,420
definitely one person alone is not

247
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,099
strong enough in this case and when

248
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:16,500
we're together we're gonna be stronger

249
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,060
and these days for instance this to last

250
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,078
two days that we've been at the Cannabis

251
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,179
Cup working you come up with a lot of

252
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,179
ideas

253
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:28,919
and ways to work to try to convince the

254
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,439
politicians that are at the end the ones

255
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,000
that has to do something about this so

256
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,279
this is why I think that the Cannabis

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,899
Hub is really really important in these

258
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:42,659
cases for us to be stronger and and get

259
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,578
to know to to get to reach one point

260
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:48,000
together

261
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:50,819
thank you all apart from this

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,679
um some people might think how are you

263
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,019
able to collaborate when some of you are

264
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,239
even competitors so the next question is

265
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:00,179
what's the benefit of collaborating when

266
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,740
you are sometimes competitors and how

267
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,239
does this improve or boost the

268
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,940
development of more competitive and

269
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Innovative products

270
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,820
uh uh for example in my case I think

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,740
that the problem that feed plan has are

272
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,940
common of the rest of the company

273
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:21,240
so I repeat again the same answer the

274
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,420
threat lies in the numbers so if I try

275
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,039
to do something alone is maybe maybe I

276
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:29,039
haven't the capacity to change something

277
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:32,338
but if we if we collaborate with

278
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:36,120
somebody a special expert in this sector

279
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:38,220
maybe we can found a new solution a new

280
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,539
idea a new channel of communication with

281
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,959
the agency

282
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:47,219
etc etc so again the collaboration I

283
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:49,859
think that is the key if I found

284
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,899
something interesting for us is

285
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:56,639
interesting for my competitor but

286
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:58,139
everybody win at the end this is

287
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,879
thank you

288
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,159
yeah well I think that collaborating

289
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,980
with a competitor can provide access to

290
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,539
data analytics and trends and new

291
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,639
resources that are mutually beneficial

292
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,159
that's for sure working together can

293
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,379
help identify sales opportunities and

294
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,019
promote gross selling and even you know

295
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:18,360
even though sometimes we are competitors

296
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,820
in the same sector

297
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,860
as I said before I think in some cases

298
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,899
we have to be together we have to be

299
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,778
together because we have in this case we

300
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,120
have the same interest as some of the

301
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:33,838
companies that are in the hub or or

302
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,539
similar interested you know so

303
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,820
basically is to convince the politics to

304
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,139
let us work and this is what we have to

305
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,500
do

306
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:46,919
I agree if we will you know stand

307
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,839
together then as mentioned we will have

308
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:51,958
uh

309
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:56,220
or we can make big bigger pressure to

310
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:59,638
the you know decision makers to change

311
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,980
the the rules and the sharing this

312
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,980
experience and the knowledge between the

313
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,519
you know companies and the research

314
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:11,940
facilities will definitely lead to

315
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,519
faster growing industry because if we

316
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,680
will hide from each other then nobody on

317
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,459
the end nobody will benefit

318
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:24,000
and as I mentioned before connect in

319
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:27,419
this industry and Science and transfer

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,600
the knowledge to the industry uh as soon

321
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:33,778
as possible we have big challenges now

322
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,440
you know cannabis can replace so many

323
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:40,740
things from the insulation to it's not

324
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,420
just you know so-called recreational or

325
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,399
medical it's so so much other things we

326
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,879
can get from cannabis

327
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,879
yeah

328
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:56,099
collaborate with a competitor when we

329
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,139
are in a really young industry it's the

330
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,180
forest there isn't any tree there and

331
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,759
there are growing few trees but still is

332
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,559
all to do so if you think about your

333
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,958
competitor I think it could be your

334
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,458
friend in many of the parts and for sure

335
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,739
we're going to have our own private

336
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,599
things but there is an example not

337
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,959
within the Cannabis have

338
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,659
we saw an opportunity to develop a

339
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:21,299
technology that could evaluate the many

340
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:24,360
different characters from from from hemp

341
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,979
from fiber from seeds from flowers and

342
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,860
then instead of being fighting between

343
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,778
us we just collaborate and together we

344
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,100
develop that technology that at the end

345
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,480
is one of the benefits to other

346
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,940
companies so

347
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,740
think it's so young the industry that we

348
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,540
still have a lot of collaborations to do

349
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,879
and actually there are other big

350
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,980
companies that have more power that if

351
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,778
we don't play together they are going to

352
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,860
play the game so I think there's a good

353
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,778
chance right now to have other

354
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,220
collaborations and being together in

355
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,539
that Hub I think is a really good

356
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,920
opportunity to grow

357
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:54,480
that's right

358
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,519
thank you guys

359
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,500
well let's move for move forward with

360
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,679
what are the latest innovations that

361
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,039
you're developing in your

362
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:07,219
businesses in in institutions

363
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,219
foreign

364
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,920
all the time we are generating new

365
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,958
genetics of course because we are

366
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,120
genetics

367
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,119
um and as well as different kind of

368
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,600
method to extract or purify compounds to

369
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,019
uh in order to license this knowledge to

370
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,320
our customer but if you're asking about

371
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,940
the the last or the most important one

372
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,920
um the latest things you've been doing

373
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,220
that you would like to share for example

374
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,599
okay that are relevant to you okay uh

375
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,660
because there are a lot of information

376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,420
I'm doing 11 years into the company what

377
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:48,480
you're more passionate about yeah we

378
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:51,000
have many things maybe the most

379
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,879
important one of the the last one was

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,500
the five papers scientific paper that we

381
00:16:53,879 --> 00:17:02,039
published at the last year uh we talk in

382
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,279
this studies about the new technology

383
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:08,338
not new technology new possibility to

384
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,879
the micro preparation systems

385
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:11,298
um

386
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,740
using in vitro cultures

387
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:19,379
we have evaluated different molecules of

388
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,000
asking us what happened about the

389
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,419
manager of the plan and we have

390
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,980
discovered that the uh this uh some of

391
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,179
these molecules

392
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,599
um

393
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:34,280
accelerate the metabolism and increase

394
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:38,939
the concentration of some cannabinoids

395
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:42,298
after that we have polish review where

396
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,360
we evaluate all data on the pool league

397
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:48,480
data patterns about destruction and

398
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,979
purification Mission methods in order to

399
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,259
offer

400
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,880
um something from an industrial point of

401
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,160
view to the society

402
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,340
after that we

403
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,919
um have a greater collaboration with the

404
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:05,058
hospital Veterinarian Hospital of the

405
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,059
University of Cordoba where we evaluate

406
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:09,058
the pharmacogenetic

407
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,720
of CBD in two different two different

408
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:18,480
um

409
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,000
how to say that Pathways and

410
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,558
[Music]

411
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,720
administration

412
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:27,298
bias

413
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,160
and finally we have polish something

414
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:32,480
about the equality control where we

415
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,100
evaluate the effect of the temperature

416
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,140
and this is something very relevant

417
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:41,579
because

418
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:45,840
in the last table we the participant

419
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:48,119
mentioned that some in some cases the

420
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,579
analysis are a little bit different

421
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,719
between

422
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:54,538
the labs

423
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,600
and sometimes in this publication we

424
00:18:54,538 --> 00:19:01,879
show how the temperature affect to the

425
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:06,538
results and maybe modify the quantity of

426
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,760
DHC levels and the cultivars could be a

427
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:10,879
very high problem

428
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,859
I think that this is a good summary

429
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,500
thank you a lot of work

430
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:18,479
so it's a lot

431
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,919
mainly from Bad Emperors we are so proud

432
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,460
that we are going to launch during this

433
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,240
week our new nir system that could

434
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,240
analyze

435
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,558
a bit about the technology we saw the

436
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,419
companies that have been playing with

437
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,918
that but we are really lucky we've got a

438
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,440
really good collaboration with SeaWorld

439
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,840
a company from United States uh that

440
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,820
provide together with us on the Hub we

441
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,399
can have many other companies breeders

442
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,960
and feedbacks that help us develop that

443
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,820
system after four years we are going to

444
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,740
launch it so I welcome everyone to come

445
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,720
to overstand and see that technology

446
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,720
that I'm so proud that without it

447
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,279
uh yes our Innovations we're not really

448
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:05,940
Innovations but uh in the last few years

449
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:09,298
we were helping with the several uh you

450
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,279
know doctorates or Master degrees for

451
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:15,619
our students and the faculty of Health

452
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:18,139
Sciences uh then we together with

453
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:21,538
biotechnological faculty

454
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,840
we are we have a project of family

455
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:26,940
growing under different conditions on

456
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,599
different places in Slovenia where we

457
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,340
follow and actually our

458
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:35,339
chief of flight is following the

459
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:37,678
cannabinet interpret profiles or from

460
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:39,019
different areas for the different

461
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,419
strains

462
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:45,418
then we are now working on the

463
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:49,620
development of biodegradable polymers

464
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:53,038
from hemp which I hope will sometimes in

465
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:56,000
the future you know replace the petrol

466
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,000
based polymers

467
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:03,918
our work we also presented on the last

468
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:09,418
kind of World Conference in in Colombia

469
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:11,190
uh also as a scientific word work where

470
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,419
we also presented the

471
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,919
[Music]

472
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:19,259
uh samples analysis of samples which was

473
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,000
used by

474
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,940
uh

475
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,359
patients from the black market so we're

476
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,240
also following this part I know it's uh

477
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,178
semi-legal but it's very important that

478
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,240
we obtain data what the people are using

479
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:38,840
you know to improve their health so this

480
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,839
is in short

481
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,919
yeah well yes

482
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:46,798
we are a beer stimulants and special

483
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,780
fertilizers producers

484
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,119
um at the moment I'm going to tell you

485
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,918
the three projects that we are working

486
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,439
and at the same time collaborating with

487
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,900
the Hub with the universities here in

488
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,120
Barcelona okay at the moment we are

489
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,360
doing some evaluation of patented the

490
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,739
Emulsion of plant oils on monosilic acid

491
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,918
as a tank mix

492
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,440
additive for a better performance of PPP

493
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,380
it's also trying to reduce the use of

494
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,779
pesticides okay in the other side we

495
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,020
have developed a growth system that is

496
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:21,240
GMP certified

497
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:23,819
is acquired with a Vortex spray device

498
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,120
for able root system basically we're

499
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:28,798
working with two group systems and we

500
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,538
are implementing some sensors together

501
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,859
with the students at the University at

502
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:36,779
the UPC to improve the the the system

503
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:39,418
basically

504
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,339
um mixing the both projects together we

505
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,080
are also working with at the faculty of

506
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:46,199
biology here at the University of

507
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:50,699
Barcelona optimizing the expression of

508
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:54,659
genotype in in specific strengths of

509
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,980
CBD hemp okay this is basically where we

510
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,620
are right now

511
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,839
okay thank you guys

512
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:04,439
so maybe let's move to the last question

513
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:07,139
then we open a space for questions

514
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,700
so how to Envision the Cannabis industry

515
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,200
looking like in the future from a

516
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,779
research and Technology ecosystem

517
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,100
perspective I mean what does it depend

518
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,099
on to fulfill this vision

519
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:24,600
well we see it we look we see working

520
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,179
with clean wealth sources and under

521
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,639
quality control formulated produce

522
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:32,280
products I mean we want to go to for a

523
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,340
cleaner Planet this is the idea to work

524
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,678
with less residual products we work with

525
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:40,439
non-heavy Metals at all in the products

526
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,679
we have also developed developed the the

527
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,320
growth system as I said

528
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,298
to economize the the the growth system

529
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,859
we are going to work with the less plans

530
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:52,319
but at the same time we want to have the

531
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:54,899
same production but with this we are

532
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,480
going to reduce cost of production time

533
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,659
nutrient soil

534
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,579
about that apart that the materials used

535
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,620
are all

536
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,619
how would you say it in English like

537
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:09,239
clean materials not not residue

538
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,639
materials okay

539
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,679
and I think data is going to be the

540
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,740
future so that's why we are also working

541
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,679
in implementing all kind of sensors in

542
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,538
our crop to get the maximum data

543
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,120
possible from our crop

544
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:27,900
like this we also reduce cost because we

545
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:31,259
can improve all the all the treatments

546
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,419
okay this this has for the future and

547
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,460
this is what we are working

548
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:39,538
yeah

549
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:43,679
um the connection with is my idea is the

550
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:46,379
data for me to to um to create a future

551
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,200
a company with future is essential to

552
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,299
Innovation and for that reason fetal

553
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,259
plan is focus complete is completely

554
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:58,639
focused in the science uh in great

555
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:03,779
Innovation and explore the data uh later

556
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,480
the explore the knowledge and uh this is

557
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:09,058
the problem the science The Innovation

558
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:13,079
we have two different problems we need

559
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:15,839
that the company have uh feel free to to

560
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,839
to create something new and the another

561
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:23,339
problem is always the same the money so

562
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:26,939
what we need we need a stable rules from

563
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:29,720
the government without the varieties or

564
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,298
during the time or maybe

565
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,179
interpretation of that because uh if

566
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,400
something changes maybe a product of

567
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,700
three or four years could be disappear

568
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,798
in only one moment and something

569
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,080
important in the morning so we

570
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,859
appreciate if the government the

571
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,319
government create special grants

572
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:54,599
to to help us to develop something

573
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,980
interesting for the community at the end

574
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,278
because this is the future of the

575
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,778
society The Innovation the data at the

576
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,419
end

577
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:07,319
thank you Carlos yes definitely you know

578
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,940
simple legislation is the key for

579
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,278
developing this Market because

580
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,659
everything what is over regulated you

581
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:18,900
can almost not come forward you know

582
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:22,440
but the other things I hope that or

583
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,720
maybe we see that everybody is realizing

584
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,778
that cannabis will be the next

585
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,798
Industrial Revolution from the point of

586
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:34,079
sustainability you know from I don't

587
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,480
know many of things we are using today

588
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,000
from plastic from whatever can be

589
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,538
replaced with sustainability use

590
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,079
sustainable plant

591
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:48,379
uh and uh and the plant or processing

592
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,480
the hemp has much lower

593
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,960
environmental and CO2 impact you know if

594
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:59,159
you produce whatever from hemp it we use

595
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,819
much less energy energy than if we use

596
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,580
you know the traditional waste so I hope

597
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:09,619
that we all will you know bring this

598
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:14,879
together and our lawmakers with finally

599
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:18,359
get it that there's must be changes soon

600
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,940
I agree thank you good uh just to finish

601
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,599
my view of the future of that industry

602
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,480
is to exactly replace the petrol

603
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,240
to see the new Evolution of all what

604
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,058
this plant can give us to not destroy

605
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,859
the plan to change the humanity to see

606
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:37,678
that we have a powerful plan that

607
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,839
together with data with universities and

608
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,380
with Innovation we can actually change

609
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,259
all what we use our homes our clothes

610
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,419
all our furniture our cars everything

611
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,740
could be made out of hemp so I think

612
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,600
this is the filter that we want to see

613
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,819
when we create the Hub and actually

614
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,139
within Venice we always have been trying

615
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:57,298
to look for new technologies

616
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,919
collaborating with companies to look for

617
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:01,079
that future the companies that are going

618
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,880
to develop that technologies that are

619
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,619
going to replace the products that

620
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,940
everyone is using are going to be the

621
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,918
ones that are going to have the key

622
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,600
point to develop that industry and it's

623
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,640
not going to be for smokers for patients

624
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,219
it's going to be for everyone so that's

625
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,080
my future and my view please let's work

626
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,360
together to develop that industry that

627
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,460
technologies have done Innovations and

628
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,558
let's do it together I think there is a

629
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,319
lot there and we are missing the point

630
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,859
so view unit forces we have a big chance

631
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:31,980
and I just want to add you know I hope

632
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:36,418
that industry or investor will realize

633
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,740
that there will be no moves without real

634
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,259
investors

635
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,298
you know

636
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:45,240
because to develop some new product you

637
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:48,538
need a lot of money and it's hard to get

638
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:53,220
money from the bank these days so we are

639
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:55,379
really depend on the this sector

640
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,360
I agree I agree for sure Carlos was

641
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,039
saying France we say investors we need

642
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,339
money but for sure I think we need to be

643
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:05,220
consumers will start that Revolution

644
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:07,139
once we start buying chemicals people

645
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,419
will start doing people will invest

646
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,120
companies will invest in him to develop

647
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,500
that industry so I think we all of us

648
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,918
the ones that we are here in the world

649
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:20,220
need to start consuming hemp products to

650
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:23,460
let that Revolution go

651
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,100
yeah quite an holistic uh change what we

652
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,440
need well thank you very much

653
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,740
and is there any question for the

654
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,740
speakers

655
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,700
[Applause]

656
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,519
hello my name is Christian Gaya

657
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:51,359
I'm listening to

658
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,298
um

659
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:58,558
More Than This panel and everybody

660
00:29:54,298 --> 00:30:01,980
agrees on that the law must change and

661
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,798
the laws makers must be convinced and

662
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,058
there must be pressure on lawmakers and

663
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,000
so on

664
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:11,158
so we all know that politic is heavily

665
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,538
influenced by Lobby

666
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:19,380
Lobby work so what do you think about

667
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:21,538
how this process is maybe interfered by

668
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,480
pharmaceutical Lobby

669
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:27,839
behind that totally it's totally related

670
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,579
MEPS is control exactly by the

671
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,619
government they don't allow us to do

672
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,418
research and develop our Industries here

673
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,519
because they are the ones that have it

674
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:39,059
who is the one that is exporting

675
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,759
cannabis in Spain is the company is

676
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:43,980
related with the King and like with all

677
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,538
but we know Franco and all

678
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,880
the bad situation that we had in our

679
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,919
country so for sure it's obvious this is

680
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,940
why I was saying that if we change that

681
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,340
concern for sure it's going to be

682
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,259
difficult to change the economy's law we

683
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:57,058
already do it all the black market do it

684
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:58,619
so everyone is consuming cannabis in

685
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:01,379
Spain we are waiting a lot but everyone

686
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:03,058
is already using cannabis so what I

687
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,500
think is that we have the power as a

688
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:06,538
consumers to strive to look into other

689
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,640
Industries and yeah they love it control

690
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:10,980
everything it's only us as a consumers

691
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,620
that could press and see how it's gonna

692
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,500
this change

693
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,558
this is my viewer

694
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,558
um

695
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,439
um of course

696
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,460
the minister of Agriculture mentioned

697
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:36,000
before that the agency and don't create

698
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,620
Laos so only regulate the situation

699
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,960
so it's a politician

700
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:45,658
the answer is in the politicians so the

701
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,940
MPS is only a regulator

702
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:50,460
if we don't have the capacity Life

703
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:55,080
Society to uh

704
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:58,740
demand a new situation the MPS haven't

705
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,740
the tools to do nothing is the minister

706
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,740
so

707
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:09,720
yeah I certainly agree because the

708
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:12,058
biggest problems are not the politicians

709
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,360
the biggest problems of bureaucrats

710
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:17,460
because politicians they change they

711
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,639
have to go to elections at least every

712
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:24,620
four years you know then they promise US

713
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:28,799
whatever but when it comes all to the

714
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:31,979
bureaucratic Mills it stops I am in this

715
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,019
process in Slovenia for 20 years I was

716
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,339
on I don't know how many committees for

717
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:39,839
Health and Social Justice and whatever

718
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:42,058
politicians in Slovenia you will not

719
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,980
find even one politician who is against

720
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:46,558
the regulation of cannabis not even

721
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,960
police for example but bureaucratson

722
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,298
Ministry of Health and so on

723
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,640
they stop the things you know because

724
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:55,379
they had they they are not elected they

725
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,559
are there forever and that's the point

726
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,320
and I hope this new government and the

727
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:04,859
the new some

728
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:07,079
officials and the Ministries uh that we

729
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:10,079
will be able to change this perspective

730
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:12,720
very soon and that's that's the only way

731
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,480
among education of course

732
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,000
yeah I I agree with you he

733
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,759
um I mentioned before that of course in

734
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,740
Spain the bureaucratic system is chaotic

735
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,679
and a disaster for the companies if we

736
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,659
try to do something new especially so

737
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,399
yeah I I just want to mention that I

738
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,860
don't know is Romania is exporting

739
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,778
cannabis but the the funny priorities

740
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:35,699
that we don't have a medicinal law but

741
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:37,140
we export and actually the ones are

742
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,058
exporting related with the government

743
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,980
and all these bureaucracies so what I

744
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,038
was saying is just look to the numbers

745
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,019
look to the money and who is the one

746
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:47,339
that is exporting and then you will have

747
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,419
your answer

748
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:53,759
you know it's everything you shady area

749
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:56,840
regarding the single convention any

750
00:33:53,759 --> 00:34:00,859
extractor of cannabis is illegal even

751
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:04,199
hemp extract CBD extract is against the

752
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:06,898
single convention so there must be

753
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,940
changes maybe not we will never move a

754
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:12,118
single convention because it's here like

755
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,099
for 60 years and it will be another but

756
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,320
at least

757
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:18,179
you know inside the European Union or

758
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,039
whatever because this is really a

759
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,039
nonsense after 60 years

760
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:30,200
hey thank you for your words my question

761
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,119
would be

762
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:36,539
a common sense Logic for the future of

763
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,440
cannabis for example in Europe uh

764
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:43,500
wouldn't be it much more better if we

765
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,000
would have communities in the model like

766
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:51,179
we have tomatoes you know like

767
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,659
more home Growers are the most cannabis

768
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,579
is grown by home Growers even more than

769
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:59,358
the industry in the whole world will

770
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:03,719
grow in the future and the Tomato model

771
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:06,779
exemplifies exactly this kind of like

772
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:09,299
you have old strains you have the

773
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,420
industry which is growing you have uh

774
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,700
you know everybody grows Tomatoes if you

775
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,920
have a garden why not cannabis and why

776
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:18,919
not regulate it in the same way yeah

777
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,440
can answer that because somebody's gonna

778
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:24,440
go but what about the children

779
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:28,559
save the children from weed you can't

780
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,239
just grow weed at your house kids will

781
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,858
get the wrong idea

782
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,159
that's the problem and then also when

783
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:38,819
you tell a bunch of Corporations

784
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:42,000
oh go ahead uh you you don't have to

785
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,980
convince convinced people like us you

786
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,119
know you have to address this to

787
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,579
somebody else

788
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,800
we know we are fighting for this but

789
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,500
it's hard to explain this to the

790
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,599
bureaucrat which is always in the same

791
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,599
mode bureaucratic mode

792
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,180
engineer was studying here at the

793
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:02,400
University of Barcelona and I was like

794
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:04,019
yeah I really want to learn how to do

795
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
the best cannabis in the world and then

796
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:09,179
I was talking with my teachers which is

797
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,280
the most powerful uh crop related with

798
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:13,139
the economy and he was his tomato it's

799
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,720
really what really it's tomato it is

800
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:17,039
it's tomato but I would say as uh he was

801
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,838
mentioning you know what about the kids

802
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,338
and he's actually a psychoactive

803
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:21,719
substance which we should have been

804
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:23,099
regulated but I would say why we don't

805
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,719
have it as a wine

806
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,180
and we have been talking a lot about

807
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,159
that and it's really related we always

808
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:30,480
want to have the cheapest wine that

809
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,279
we're gonna have in the supermarket

810
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,740
which is one even liter and you are

811
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,900
going to be able to have your 200

812
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,338
000 or whatever a really good wine so I

813
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,039
would say I like the idea of a tomato

814
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:43,519
but I could probably prefer to compare

815
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,519
with wine

816
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,199
actually we have a good wine law in

817
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:52,440
Slovenia which says that everybody can

818
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,659
have wine at home as much as you want up

819
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,838
to I don't know tons of liters your own

820
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:59,759
wine homegrown but as soon as you enter

821
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,179
the market you have to fill fulfill

822
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,280
certain uh you know regulations and I

823
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,799
think it should be regulated completely

824
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,660
the same way

825
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,660
one more question from here please

826
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,619
hello and my name is Sergio I'm a

827
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,618
production director in linear health

828
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,300
well we have all the problems that you

829
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,519
already mentioned about the AMS about

830
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,339
regulatory about laws everything you

831
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,800
mentioned we have the same problem we

832
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:34,500
don't have the only ones who are let's

833
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,780
say producing for exporting Spain many

834
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,599
many other peoples has a license

835
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,060
I don't see any benefit we are getting

836
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,700
to be linear I mean

837
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:48,239
there is nothing different from each

838
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:49,159
other so I'm agree about what Carlos

839
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,679
said

840
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:56,539
that we should be together in order to

841
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:59,659
push new regulations and and of course

842
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:02,460
we will be close in order to understand

843
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:04,639
what you are doing because we are doing

844
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,220
something similar so

845
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,759
I'm here in order to to know you and and

846
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:13,739
push together

847
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,359
I could be a super pleasure I think Hub

848
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:18,179
would really need to be together with

849
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,799
Lineo sorry if I said something that

850
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,399
could

851
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,099
um

852
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,539
um yeah yeah it's exactly but uh I was

853
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,640
just looking to the numbers no I would

854
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:30,300
not say that you are the the first

855
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:32,819
exporter no you jump from 6 to 24.5 tons

856
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,760
which is actually wow man you really

857
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,400
good and uh I don't know I would say

858
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,020
like yeah please let's work together I

859
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,940
think there are a lot of companies and a

860
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,858
lot of projects that jump from Spain to

861
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,380
Portugal because Mbps is really

862
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:51,179
difficult to work and uh who knows why

863
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,619
this was my point of view but I'm sure

864
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:56,159
we could work together and I would love

865
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:59,760
that sorry one comment uh because I

866
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:02,480
agree that is very uh is not fast

867
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,520
is not easy because you need a

868
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,380
pharmacological knowledge but the rule

869
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,780
assist and you can work with the MPS

870
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:14,579
because I am working with two different

871
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:16,800
kind of licenses during 11 years so

872
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,980
only like a comment

873
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,980
foreign

874
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:25,320
I'd like to make a comment about this um

875
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:27,719
maybe we're approaching government in

876
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,119
the wrong way if you look at Canada and

877
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:34,039
the United States the amount of money

878
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:38,338
that has been collected in taxes is wild

879
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:40,559
and you know it it right now countries

880
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:43,440
need money for infrastructure for

881
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:46,199
everything so why not approach

882
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,380
government in a way that we can actually

883
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:52,739
save you with the amount of Revenue it

884
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:56,099
is over taxed in Canada absolutely but

885
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:58,139
you know the different U.S states it's

886
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,119
it's incredible how much money is being

887
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:05,279
collected by governments

888
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:08,460
you know I know this we therefore we are

889
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,300
making Now new approach it's it's not

890
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:18,300
just this it's also human rights and you

891
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:21,359
know uh uh for example in Slovenia we

892
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:25,019
spent yearly 20 million euro to

893
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:27,779
prosecute people or to you know imprison

894
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:29,039
people which are on the end release by

895
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,380
Supreme Court

896
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:34,320
because you know to help yourself it

897
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:38,519
cannot be a criminal offense so why we

898
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,338
are spending 20 million euro yearly on

899
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,559
nothing that's where 2 million people in

900
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:48,259
Slovenia we are not big nation you know

901
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:51,900
but but you know now it's coming slowly

902
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:55,079
and uh if we all together we'll pull

903
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,358
this Wagon in the same direction then it

904
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,640
will be much easier yeah I would like

905
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,639
that I totally agree with you actually

906
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:04,980
we have been uh during that working

907
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,739
teams inside the canaries Hub we have

908
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,559
been trying to evaluate how we could

909
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,598
um proceed with our report show it to

910
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,699
the government how taxes compare with

911
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,800
already countries like yours know that

912
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:19,019
we already have a sample uh in the panel

913
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,820
before they were talking about how the

914
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,579
pharmaceutical Lobby

915
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,320
has the power into that country and

916
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,180
that's the key only Spain spend the

917
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,140
devil than friends and Germany you know

918
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:30,239
so I think

919
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,699
that's something that good related to me

920
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,019
with that so what what can we do no this

921
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:36,539
was one of the points let's do that

922
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:38,579
report let's show it and yesterday we

923
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:40,320
were talking about what can we do we

924
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,539
need a revelation and listen to the

925
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,880
medicinal cannabis we have been waiting

926
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:46,739
December would say the way that we were

927
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,660
expecting in December and we still are

928
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:50,338
March and we don't have any answer and

929
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:51,779
we are suffering that is going to change

930
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:53,820
the government and we're still not gonna

931
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,980
fall low so this is something telling

932
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,579
you you know there's a huge Lobby

933
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:03,000
here pressing that and what can we do go

934
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:04,920
go to the streets work together or at

935
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
least try to find a solution but I love

936
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,000
that point thank you

937
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:13,858
any more questions

938
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,039
any more questions we have two more

939
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,039
