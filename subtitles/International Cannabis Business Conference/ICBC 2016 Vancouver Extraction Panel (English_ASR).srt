1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,638
I'm an extraction guy myself I've been

2
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:12,038
involved in just learning and educating

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:15,308
about the glandular trichomes and where

4
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:18,579
these medicines that we are so often

5
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:20,259
talking about we're there biosynthesized

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:22,119
in the plant where they're produced and

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,920
so I learned a lot about glandular

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,140
trichomes and the different types and

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,140
how these different cannabinoids and

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,640
terpene compounds are biosynthesized

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,618
inside the glandular trichomes head and

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,829
of course I helped popularize water hash

13
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:39,039
over the course for the last 17 years

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,380
I'm very much more into like sieving

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,149
than extracting so it's very it's going

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,130
to be a unique panel for me to moderate

17
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:47,739
because both of these gentlemen are

18
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,050
doing things that I haven't been

19
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:52,719
involved with as much over the course of

20
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,219
the last 20 years so I'm also very

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,799
excited to hear what they have to say so

22
00:00:54,219 --> 00:01:00,729
I'll start out with but my name is Andy

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,439
Joseph I'm from apex supercritical my

24
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:05,408
story briefly i started apex

25
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:08,078
supercritical as a side job in 2001

26
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:11,200
spinks spent six years in the Navy did

27
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:13,208
submarines at a Pearl Harbor and after I

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,539
got out of the military went to I estate

29
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:18,130
for welding engineering GI Bill doesn't

30
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:19,509
pay for all of your school so you got to

31
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,759
make a few extra bucks so I started a

32
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:23,349
fabrication business ran across a

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,629
customer who needed some botanical oil

34
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,938
extraction equipment and I said I don't

35
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:31,839
know what that is but I'll make it and

36
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:33,428
give it a shot we really wanted to have

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,490
boots on the ground to understand the

38
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:39,219
industry most of our employees are from

39
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:42,310
the medical industry both the growers

40
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:45,129
and our lab techs we kind of were good

41
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,418
at knowing what we don't know and we

42
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:50,289
knew we didn't know enough about

43
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:51,819
extraction and about concentrates so we

44
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:54,189
we found the best team that we could

45
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:56,168
brought them in and that's really when

46
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:59,828
we started exploring molecular

47
00:01:56,168 --> 00:02:02,168
separation and distillation we brought

48
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:05,468
the technology in about three years ago

49
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:08,800
and really had to dial in the parameters

50
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:10,868
of the equipment that we were using once

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,010
we figured out how you were able to

52
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:15,930
basically target cannabinoids and leave

53
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,840
behind the

54
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,170
parodies and the undesirable part of the

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,878
plant we really thought we were headed

56
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:27,119
somewhere with it we contacted the

57
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,218
manufacturer which was BTA in Germany

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,609
they've been a global leader in

59
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:34,459
manufacturing distillation equipment

60
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:38,599
over the last two and a half decades and

61
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,799
their equipment is used in petroleum

62
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:45,169
industry they're used in agricultural

63
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,170
industry and the pharmaceutical industry
