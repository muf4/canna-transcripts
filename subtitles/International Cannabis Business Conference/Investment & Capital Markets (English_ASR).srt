1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,019
oh I'm sorry I have a loud voice can you

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,380
hear me better now all right I'm excited

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:13,138
to be here uh for those that don't know

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,179
me I'm from Houston Texas which is a

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,038
weird uh place to be in the Cannabis

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,519
industry but I've been following the

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,520
industry for six years now and I came to

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,379
the first ICBC conference back in San

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,820
Francisco and it's a little trivia I

10
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,399
think it's the only conference I've ever

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,839
just attended I'm usually like either

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,960
speaking or something to do with the

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,640
media but I do two things but they both

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,340
revolve around following the industry

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,899
for investors really and I run 420

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,300
investor which focuses on public

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,520
companies and you know we have one

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,619
that's about to be public here so we'll

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,180
definitely talk about that and then I

20
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,439
also run new cannabis Ventures which

21
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:54,238
covers the whole space and

22
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,399
it's the basic purpose of new canvas

23
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,779
Ventures is to to keep a pulse on on the

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,878
business side of the industry and help

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,859
investors and operators kind of find out

26
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,718
what's really going on and so I'm glad

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,959
you're here with us today we have three

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,700
very different types of people and

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,399
companies and we'll be learning from

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,640
them a lot has changed two of these are

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,400
OG guys that I've known for a while so

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,799
I'm going to start from the far right

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,840
so we have Scott Van ricksell from bang

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,240
if I'm sure everybody's pretty familiar

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,340
with bang but he's been in the industry

36
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,319
since 2010 and uh about to go public so

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,540
we're going to hear that perspective uh

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,000
of what it's like to transition from

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,439
private to public and then we have Dean

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,040
arbit who's been in the industry since

41
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,539
2011 I believe and I didn't even know

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,759
this I've known him from the media side

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,259
and all of his Investments but he has

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,079
been involved with a really interesting

45
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,899
company called Wagner Demas which is a

46
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:55,199
technology company for pre-rolls and

47
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,680
other things as well but.com and then I

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,478
just met Carly and uh pinch hitting

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,700
actually and I wanted to point out Jake

50
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,500
had a family emergency you may be

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,600
expecting to see Jake Highmark he could

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,639
make it and Aaron also had a family

53
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,579
emergency unfortunately but we're lucky

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,199
to have Carly and uh I'm going to let

55
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,599
everybody start off by introducing

56
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,119
themselves but Carly is from garden

57
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,859
Society all three of these folks are

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,120
from California but what I think is

59
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,120
going to you're going to find to be so

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,039
interesting is that they're all involved

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,659
not only necessarily just in the rest of

62
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,579
the country but really in the rest of

63
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,680
the world as well things are changing

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,480
that much so it's cool to be big in

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,860
California but there's a whole big world

66
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,780
out there we're going to find out so

67
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,099
what I'd like to do is start off with

68
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,378
you Scott and then we'll work our way

69
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,000
back if you could just talk about what

70
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:45,179
you were doing before you came into the

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,340
industry and what you're doing now

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,780
um actually what I was doing is kind of

73
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,319
how I ended up in this

74
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,840
um

75
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,458
I had a chocolate and gelato company in

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Albuquerque with my brother

77
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,219
uh

78
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,800
we had a

79
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,939
problem with our gelato and a friend of

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,439
mine who opened one of the first

81
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,818
cannabis Labs here

82
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,919
uh Robert Martin invited me out as he

83
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,318
was opening his lab and he took me

84
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,318
around showed me the dispensaries and as

85
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,399
a chef I was dismayed and then when you

86
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,679
add that there was supposed to be

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,439
medical products I was

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,420
kind of embarrassed

89
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,340
not that people weren't

90
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,500
capable is that people weren't making

91
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,319
the choice to to kind of do things what

92
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,120
I saw as right

93
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,939
came out a couple months later started

94
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,560
bang and we progressed from there into

95
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,620
what I believe to be one of the leading

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,840
cannabis brands for finished goods

97
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,219
Dean same question to you

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,239
thanks Ellen so I started in 2011 uh

99
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:51,180
previously I was in the media space

100
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:54,360
had an exit there and uh

101
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,580
initially got into the media side of the

102
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,959
Cannabis industry was it as an

103
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,959
Enthusiast uh as as long as

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,360
as I can remember but um got into the

105
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,098
media space which gave me a lot of

106
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,140
visibility

107
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:15,598
um and uh a lot of color a lot of data

108
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:18,959
and then a couple years later started to

109
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:23,579
uh actually make investments and and uh

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:27,000
embed with companies and so actually one

111
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:31,198
of the an event that I founded New West

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,079
Summit was where I met Mitchell

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,580
and Morgan my partners uh in Wagner

114
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,478
demos which is a very interesting

115
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:40,439
technology it's essentially we've

116
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,959
patented a

117
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,620
a pre-roll platform that allows us to

118
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:49,739
produce uh in great scale and so we work

119
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,319
with big public company in Canada to

120
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,939
license that and then the other

121
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,800
interesting thing I do so we we produce

122
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:01,740
our own we're our own likes to see in

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,918
California working with other brands and

124
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,400
then on the retail side

125
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:10,399
I help run bud.com which right now will

126
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,698
be Statewide

127
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,799
delivery in California

128
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:20,160
sometime in the second quarter and then

129
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,400
we're also launching an online store for

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,380
non-thc goods that we'll be able to ship

131
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,379
worldwide CBD and

132
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:31,319
merchandise and that type of stuff so

133
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,600
I mean Carly Warner same for you sure so

134
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,959
uh Carly Warner with Garden Society just

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,020
like Aaron but a little lower altitude

136
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,758
um we had founded the company in 2016

137
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,060
that's when I entered the Cannabis

138
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,120
industry uh previously was in wine for

139
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,240
10 years which is where I met Aaron and

140
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,280
we really launched Garden society as a

141
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,780
way to reach women in a mark in a market

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,038
that where they weren't being reached

143
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,978
and in a way that they weren't being

144
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,899
talked spoken to so we're really proud

145
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,399
of what we're building we're really

146
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,719
excited to be working with a lot of

147
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,819
different partners within the industry

148
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,039
to make sure that we can help break that

149
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,538
stigma down and make a change you

150
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,639
weren't just in the wine Industries with

151
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,800
constellation Brands right yes I was

152
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,560
with constellation Brands and actually

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,418
helped launch Aaron's husband's wine

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,978
brand through that company which is how

155
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:23,459
we met

156
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:25,199
um yeah okay so now you know a little

157
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,659
bit about who uh who you're going to

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
learn from today so my first question is

159
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,900
for both of you on the right you guys

160
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,159
like I said are kind of OG's in the

161
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,339
industry you've been around for a long

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,380
time and things are definitely changing

163
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,839
right now and I was wondering if you

164
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:42,000
could share your perspectives on

165
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,279
compared to five years ago perhaps how

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,819
things have changed in terms of the

167
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,439
capital markets and raising capital

168
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,319
um you and I kind of spoke about earlier

169
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:56,279
that the the idea of institutional money

170
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,080
uh uh was absolutely unheard of five

171
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,079
years ago

172
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,019
um that's that's an obvious significant

173
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,839
change I think the risk

174
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,758
factor of people feeling comfortable now

175
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,159
that companies are public there's more

176
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,979
of them there's more options there's

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,900
more sites like yourself that have are

178
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,000
providing good information for people

179
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,560
where they're they're able to make

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
investments without just putting on

181
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,519
green goggles and saying oh I'm going to

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,038
turn a million dollars into 50 million

183
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,899
overnight

184
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:31,800
and and aside from that is also the

185
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:34,978
maturity of the companies you know the

186
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,740
the even our licensing program went from

187
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:40,258
you know who you could get to now

188
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,780
actively searching out the best and and

189
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,580
I think that that's something that I

190
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,679
then goes to people feeling more

191
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,899
comfortable and mitigation rests is the

192
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,699
maturity of the industry the maturity of

193
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,939
The Operators

194
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,620
um regulation has certainly imposed its

195
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,660
Mighty well in California you look at

196
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,978
how many operators there were in

197
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,080
California

198
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,159
18 months ago to how many are in place

199
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,279
now and

200
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,560
Dean can certainly attest to that

201
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,198
it thinned the herd and that's happening

202
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,538
across the country and California was

203
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,180
unique in showing how that would happen

204
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,800
in that it had a very thriving

205
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,038
functional

206
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,639
in Industry at a large scale

207
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,500
with relatively no regulation and then

208
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,939
suddenly there was regulation whereas if

209
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,399
you take most of the other thing you had

210
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,379
black market but that influence of

211
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,939
Regulation allowed it to grow and I

212
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,060
think that's a testament to the

213
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,620
California companies that survived were

214
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,239
the ones that could adjust quickly and

215
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,580
and I think that that's a big change was

216
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,799
and those companies will be rewarded

217
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,720
Dean you've seen both sides of it the as

218
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,539
an investor and in somebody raising

219
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,139
Capital how things changed I'd probably

220
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:55,199
just really Echo a lot of Scots thoughts

221
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:58,439
there the the sophistication level of

222
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
investors has has just picked up

223
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,779
um

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,060
I think a Big Driver there is uh

225
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:08,100
Canadian legalization

226
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,879
um what that's done is it's sort of it's

227
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:15,778
just exacerbated uh I think it's it's

228
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:18,000
pushed the process along uh for even U.S

229
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:19,799
based investors who now see essentially

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,659
missing the bus

231
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,479
um and then obviously

232
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:27,000
with constellation

233
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,778
you've got now an Avenue for for

234
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,458
institutional money it's just go north

235
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:35,059
but still then it sort of matriculates

236
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:38,458
down so it's it's just essentially

237
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:40,859
sophistication which is ratcheted up and

238
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:43,018
I'd say that's probably true for both

239
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,419
investors and operators

240
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,539
if Carly I think your company operates

241
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,039
solely in California right now but

242
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:51,719
you're raising money from investors and

243
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm curious when you have these

244
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,440
conversations how much pressure are they

245
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,539
giving you or how much do they want to

246
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,300
see you guys go outside of California

247
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,919
and what is your philosophy on how to

248
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,319
handle that pressure

249
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,360
so we're definitely getting that

250
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,839
question from all investors that we're

251
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,879
speaking to in a serious manner

252
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,620
we aren't currently looking to expand

253
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,838
outside of the state but it is in our

254
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,560
you know future plans

255
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,240
um I think you that's mandatory

256
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,799
um but I definitely we're not getting an

257
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,080
immense amount of pressure I would say

258
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,120
to to quickly go multi-state but it's

259
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,420
definitely within like the first couple

260
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,799
of conversations and how many calls a

261
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,639
week do you guys feel from Canadian

262
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,639
investment bankers

263
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,940
Fields most of them but they're quite a

264
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,219
few

265
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,560
how serious they are is questionable but

266
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,778
definitely a few of them have been

267
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,518
okay so my next question and someone

268
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:50,759
already hinted the constellation

269
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,519
investment but Altria ambev which is

270
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,679
Budweiser

271
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:58,379
constellation and Molson they've all

272
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,899
made these strategic Investments or

273
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,539
Partnerships into the space and I'm

274
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,339
curious uh you know on the one hand it

275
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,860
kind of validates the industry but on

276
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,420
the other hand I think smaller companies

277
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,579
have to be a little bit concerned and

278
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,559
I'll go in reverse order here how do you

279
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:15,479
view these big strategic investors

280
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,399
coming into the space is an opportunity

281
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,639
or a threat what's it make you do

282
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,220
differently definitely opportunity

283
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,778
um I think that there's a lot you know

284
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,100
for all of us to learn from what they've

285
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:27,838
done and the money that they're bringing

286
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,540
in I think we need to be really careful

287
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,180
and then that's a a big reason why we're

288
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:35,099
trying to scale sustainably right now so

289
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,219
that we can be appealing to someone like

290
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,720
that but um you know it's not necessary

291
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,120
it's a little ways off for us right now

292
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,420
is it impacting you well I think it

293
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,778
validates the space I think uh if you're

294
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:52,759
talking about look there's still there's

295
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:55,200
still some murky issues there as far as

296
00:11:52,759 --> 00:12:00,120
legality and when you're talking about

297
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,940
you know the borders and I think it's a

298
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,539
testament to the upside in our industry

299
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,660
the fact that um you know blue chip

300
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:11,699
brands are now seeing that this this is

301
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,500
a mandatory play

302
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,000
um so I think it's absolutely an

303
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,299
opportunity I think it's one that

304
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,278
operators need to embrace it's just it's

305
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,778
it's not going backwards yeah

306
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,539
yeah are you afraid of this scattered

307
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:27,600
you embrace it no I think the the first

308
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:30,299
round of those Investments were those

309
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,820
companies seeing two things

310
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,439
can we cover the losses that we're

311
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,120
seeing in our you know Southern Wine and

312
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,399
Spirits was fairly open about the fact

313
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,139
that in markets where cannabis is

314
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,600
legalized they experience a six to eight

315
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,159
percent reduction in alcohol sales

316
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,200
they've got to cover that somewhere and

317
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,819
I think that the alcohol and tobacco

318
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,620
industry that first round of investment

319
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:55,320
was a how do we

320
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,539
re-deploy money to a market that we're

321
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,240
losing ground to that's number one

322
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:03,719
and number two is those smaller initial

323
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,820
pushes were how are our shareholders and

324
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,639
is the market can respond to us as a

325
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,379
company getting our toes wet once they

326
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,579
saw that that was going to work out well

327
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,159
and it was a good thing that's when you

328
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:16,019
had that second big plops of money now

329
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,600
now they felt comfortable to dive in as

330
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,320
opposed to touch a toe

331
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,240
um

332
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,980
since we start our company I've always

333
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,079
believed the end is either going to be

334
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,539
one of two things bought or bullied and

335
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,419
I would much rather be on the bot than

336
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:34,139
the bullied I think that the Cannabis

337
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:36,659
space has to focus on having products

338
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,700
and Concepts that are going to appeal to

339
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,199
those who might bully and are more

340
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,320
appealing to buy I mean you look at

341
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,278
vitamin waters a perfect example

342
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,778
Coca-Cola very easily could have

343
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,759
developed a vitamin water on their own

344
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:49,919
it was far more efficient for them to

345
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,319
just buy it

346
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,360
um I think that there's a small handful

347
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,860
of cannabis companies 20 years from now

348
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,440
that are going to be still stand alone

349
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,200
unacquired I think that'll be a rarity

350
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,760
not the norm

351
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,680
the tobacco industry the pharmaceutical

352
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,259
industry the alcohol industry they just

353
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,379
have such a head start and such access

354
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:14,639
to funds that it will make it difficult

355
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:17,338
for cannabis to just be a monster on its

356
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,620
own but I do see them bringing their

357
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:23,339
Technologies their their marketing

358
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,078
Insight you know all of us in the room

359
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,820
that are are hiring from those other

360
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,039
Industries we're hiring from those other

361
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,379
Industries because we know they have the

362
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,599
experience to do what we want to do for

363
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,000
our companies

364
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,500
in relatively similar

365
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,059
hate to use the word Vice but Vice

366
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,559
related Industries pharmaceutical being

367
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,000
a little different but you know if

368
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,819
you're going to look how to Market

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,620
cannabis well you're going to look to a

370
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,139
company that's been doing either tobacco

371
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,720
or alcohol because those are the most

372
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,899
similar things that are being marketed

373
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,060
and I think that they offer a lot but

374
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,679
they have to be managed and those

375
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,259
relationships have to be managed so you

376
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:04,559
don't just get pushed so one one thing

377
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,559
I'll add is I think

378
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,559
um

379
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,360
yes those businesses all have uh they're

380
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,099
mature they come from mature Industries

381
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,278
um and they obviously have framework

382
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,959
that can be adapted for our space uh

383
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,220
especially things like CBD where you're

384
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,979
talking about mature distribution

385
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,360
channels the one thing that all those

386
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,420
Industries are going to need and this is

387
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,220
what we all need to understand is it

388
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:32,039
doesn't work if you go and spin

389
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,320
something up and there's not

390
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,939
authenticity behind it and you and you

391
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,540
get into cannabis

392
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,420
um

393
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:42,360
I I think the the consumers

394
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:44,219
um see past that and smell it out

395
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,980
um so I think that bodes well for those

396
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,139
of us that that understand who our

397
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,899
customers are and our customers

398
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,659
ourselves uh and live it

399
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,940
um I think that the marriage between

400
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:59,639
understanding cannabis and the Cannabis

401
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,860
culture which was bred over the you know

402
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,100
70 plus years of Prohibition that that

403
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,899
doesn't just sort of get wiped away

404
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,360
Altria doesn't get to come in and and

405
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,778
sort of do as they did

406
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,240
um you know with tobacco nicotine so I

407
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:16,338
think that's the one uh the one piece

408
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,320
that

409
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:22,440
that I think we all need to understand

410
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,240
is that they need us it's a big part of

411
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,240
it they don't understand the space all

412
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,759
they understand is that it's white hot

413
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,220
and they got to get some

414
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,458
um but they need us to be able to uh

415
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,379
sort of Route them uh and strategize

416
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,719
essentially one thing I'd say what that

417
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,220
is the the worst investment or purchase

418
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,019
one of those big companies could do

419
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,860
would would come with a clearing of

420
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,659
house because to your Testament they you

421
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,579
know a lot about distribution you know a

422
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,039
lot about manufacturing cigarettes

423
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,138
whatever it is what you don't have is

424
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,500
that ongoing relationship with the

425
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,579
Cannabis space and and that is

426
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,620
um

427
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:04,678
you know very few products that people

428
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,140
consume the product itself do they have

429
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,699
that close connection with I mean in the

430
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,380
alcohol world if you have a really close

431
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,160
connection with alcohol you're an

432
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,020
alcoholic in cannabis it's part of

433
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,519
whether you're using it for healing

434
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,558
purposes or you're using it for

435
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,039
enjoyment or whatever it is there's a

436
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:25,259
there's a connection there that simply

437
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,558
slapping another brand name or a large

438
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:30,480
scale operator and I think a good

439
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,980
example of that is you know the

440
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,259
Starbucks guy was I'm going to take over

441
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,419
the world that did not go over well

442
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:40,079
because the Cannabis space rejected that

443
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:43,679
idea of just spores feeding that down

444
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,119
their throats and I to agree with Dean

445
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,798
is I think that

446
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,659
we have a lot to offer them as well and

447
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,460
I didn't want to present that we don't I

448
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,519
just also know that

449
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,679
a lot of what we're building in many

450
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,779
cases they already have National

451
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,000
Distribution uh

452
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,918
framework for dealing with interstate

453
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,759
commerce and taxes and Regulatory stuff

454
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,799
I mean that's something that's

455
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:08,099
completely we deal with a single tax

456
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:11,038
Authority IRS a state or a federal level

457
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:13,259
and local but when tobacco and alcohol

458
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,419
moves across state lines there's all

459
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,359
kinds of new tax things that'll again be

460
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,740
new to our industry unless we have

461
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,139
someone kind of showing us the way

462
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,538
through those acquisitions

463
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,340
is so the next question is about CBD

464
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:28,558
which is really a juggernaut right now

465
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,418
white hot I think you said and I want to

466
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,099
uh everybody to hear kind of your

467
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,740
perspective and we'll start down here

468
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:37,740
and work back uh on how the popularity

469
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,500
of CBD is impacting your business

470
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,259
uh for us in particular it's it's

471
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,400
significant because our model over the

472
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:47,339
last

473
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,679
um eight years going on nine years has

474
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:52,079
been our licensing where we're

475
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,320
collecting a royalty from our licensees

476
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,058
in individual states it's substantial

477
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,918
it's nice it grew our company it allowed

478
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:02,339
us to spread our brand but it wasn't

479
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,740
reflected in a significant top-line

480
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,379
Revenue generator

481
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,359
um if you reverse the math out it's

482
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,240
great but again it's not our Top Line

483
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,759
it's our licensees Top Line CBD allows

484
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,919
at least our company the ability now to

485
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,440
have that centralized manufacturing

486
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,020
whereas cannabis you're stuck with

487
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,360
potentially 50 separate production

488
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:26,400
facilities that's economically not

489
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,079
sensible centralized production

490
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,960
centralized distribution is something

491
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,899
that we can accomplish with CBD so I see

492
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,100
that as a great value to our company in

493
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,620
addition

494
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:40,439
CBD and CBD products and terpene

495
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:43,219
products are a great way for us to start

496
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,360
to access those cannabis curious

497
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,380
marketplaces where cannabis is not yet

498
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,038
legal and Retail

499
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,980
um

500
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,960
where you're not dependent on you know a

501
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,460
small group of dispensaries you you have

502
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,500
access to

503
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,058
hundreds of thousands of locations

504
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,400
across the country I mean take

505
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:04,259
cigarettes you know Dina's in the

506
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,840
pre-roll business we have a hemp

507
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:08,460
cigarette there's 374

508
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,399
000 locations the United States that

509
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,100
sell cigarettes that's it's a huge

510
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,160
access to a market that we wouldn't have

511
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,779
previously had even if we had a licensee

512
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,419
in every state so I think that that's

513
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,058
certainly going to pave the way for

514
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:26,880
success for for cannabis companies that

515
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:28,918
have the understanding to see that

516
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,799
that's another part of the plant

517
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,679
another part of the market and another

518
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,480
opportunity for us to access buyers that

519
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,780
we wouldn't necessarily be able to do if

520
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,400
we were just focused on selling

521
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:44,399
I would say THC products but marijuana

522
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,259
products in the marijuana Marketplace

523
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,720
so uh

524
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:51,720
I agree I think

525
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,720
CBD and hemp and specifically what the

526
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,720
farm bill brought on uh is it's an

527
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,298
absolute Game Changer uh so for my

528
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,500
businesses for Wagner demos we so we

529
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:06,720
have a technology that rolls joints I

530
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,740
can roll more joints than people can

531
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,200
smoke uh however hemp

532
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,140
is a different story so now we can sit

533
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,440
there and we can distribute to 370

534
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,080
000 stores smoke shops or C stores

535
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,620
instead of the 500 dispensaries

536
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,220
uh in the U in California

537
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,619
um

538
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,620
so you're talking about a massive broad

539
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:35,099
market and you're also talking about a

540
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:38,599
great organic product that we think as

541
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:41,699
far as smokable hemp Which Scott does

542
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,558
we think it's uh it's a tobacco

543
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,659
cessation play

544
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:49,399
um not sure about the health benefits

545
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:53,820
but we think it tastes better and uh

546
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:57,419
it's less addictive for bud.com same

547
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:59,658
thing instead of delivering

548
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:03,000
um you know within a given footprint

549
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:04,440
that's tied to compliance in in each

550
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,400
state

551
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,240
um

552
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:12,298
now we can ship worldwide it's just just

553
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,079
that simple so now the you know 97 of

554
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:17,819
folks that land on bud.com can actually

555
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,099
buy something

556
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:22,319
Game Changer yeah so it's a California

557
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,500
company uh are you guys able to

558
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,779
capitalize on the CBD Trend yes CBD is

559
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,419
really interesting for us our Target

560
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,399
demographic is definitely right for hemp

561
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,940
Drive CBD products

562
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,159
um that said uh it you know has the low

563
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,440
point of entry and women really feel

564
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,360
safe there's a lot of you know Buzz

565
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,480
around it right now

566
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:49,079
um it is also a little gray in terms of

567
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,000
legality still for consumption so we're

568
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:54,119
really as a smaller company trying to

569
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,339
stay laser focused in our THC side of

570
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,099
the business making sure that we build

571
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,959
and scale sustainably in California but

572
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:02,519
it's definitely something that we keep

573
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,980
on our Horizon in addition to things

574
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,319
like multi-state and that sort of thing

575
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,240
okay and my next question is about

576
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,819
licensing and just I'm sure everybody

577
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,859
can appreciate this uh you just heard it

578
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,779
a while ago 50 different states that you

579
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,538
have to build factories in ETC if you

580
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:21,418
want to be a THC company and so a lot of

581
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:23,879
companies right now are partnering

582
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,460
they're jving there's a lot of different

583
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,320
models out there royalty and so I'm

584
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,240
going to start with you Carly why why

585
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,639
are you guys not licensing your name

586
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,679
into other states you said that you're

587
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,179
not there yet so I can understand why

588
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,519
you don't want to physically build out

589
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,500
in other states but what's holding you

590
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,179
back on the licensing part um I think

591
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,339
part of it has just been

592
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,620
focus on building and scaling in

593
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,899
California but again it's something that

594
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:51,058
you know we've had conversations we've

595
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,340
had conversations with different people

596
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:54,960
in different states but it's it just

597
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,220
hasn't been the right opportunity yet

598
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,140
but it's not something that the door is

599
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,120
closed to in any way do you think you

600
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,220
guys would rather build out in separate

601
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,719
states or is the licensing smarter how

602
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,279
do you guys go about thinking about it I

603
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,380
mean we have every day is different some

604
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,639
days we're like we should move into this

605
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,740
state right away we have this in this

606
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,299
connection it would be so easy and then

607
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,798
other days we have you know we had

608
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:15,119
someone call us from Florida we're like

609
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:16,798
hmm that's interesting we hadn't really

610
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,678
considered Florida as much as you know

611
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,240
Nevada or some other states so it's just

612
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,759
different day to day we just haven't had

613
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,558
the the right opportunity come across

614
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,400
our plate yet but I think once it will

615
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:28,859
we'll

616
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,480
make that decision then Dean is an

617
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:31,859
investor and an operator you see both

618
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,900
sides of this what are some of the pros

619
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:37,019
and cons of owning everything yourself

620
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:40,080
versus partnering and royalties things

621
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:42,839
like that I I think we we see

622
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:46,019
um look California is bigger than Canada

623
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,038
right it's it's a massive Market here

624
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,619
um

625
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,200
our ideas are sort of across the board

626
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,699
with all the businesses is is definitely

627
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,220
uh to partner with with strong folks

628
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,980
that understand their regions and have

629
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,860
resources there we do what we do and

630
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,220
then I'm a big believer in licensing

631
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:10,819
we've uh We've licensed our technology

632
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:14,159
um in Canada and now we're rolling out

633
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:16,558
licensing the pre-roll technology to

634
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,080
multi-state operators in different

635
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,599
regions of the US so big Believers of

636
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,460
that rolling out I got that

637
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,199
Scott you guys obviously are very

638
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,519
Advanced on the licensing and you talked

639
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,259
about some of the pros and cons already

640
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,139
but what else do you see as some of the

641
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,879
the pros and cons of owning the assets

642
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,559
versus partnering with people I know

643
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,179
you're in Canada through a partnership

644
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:42,119
for instance yes I mean part of the the

645
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:44,519
um it I would say more in some levels

646
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,038
now it's a necessity because

647
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,940
almost all states have limited licenses

648
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,259
they're they're

649
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,558
many cases have to be vertical you're

650
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,940
talking about huge Capital outlays

651
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,980
um you know our licensee in New York

652
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,538
just to turn in their application was a

653
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,079
million dollars

654
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:06,778
just to apply that's doing that 50 times

655
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,899
over and and then trying to manage all

656
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:12,058
that and each State's tax I mean really

657
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,860
each company would have to run as its

658
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:18,480
own entity or

659
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:19,859
you know more hair falling out than as

660
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,640
is

661
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:25,859
um it's it's something that we just felt

662
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,220
licensing was the best path for our

663
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,658
goals now there's more mature players in

664
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,839
the marketplace there's more mature

665
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:37,440
operators in the marketplace now we're

666
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:40,439
still doing either licensing or the

667
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,240
preferences JV simply because they feel

668
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,179
we have a bit more skin in the game and

669
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,859
and that's been driven by both sides of

670
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,298
the table in that

671
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,219
when you're in a market that there's a

672
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:53,099
limited license count

673
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,900
in many cases they're the driver five

674
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,699
years ago I'd get

675
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,840
a lot of calls of hey we'd like the

676
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,620
license being hey we'd like the license

677
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,639
bang because there was that drive on the

678
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,099
other side of the table they're like

679
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,860
well do we do we need Bang

680
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:09,599
because we have a captured Market

681
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,879
um I'm going to use true leave as an

682
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,859
example in Florida

683
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,360
when they called to ask us if if they

684
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:18,719
could license Bang

685
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,058
my first question is why you control 75

686
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,640
of the market between 70 75 of the

687
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:25,558
market you're you're you've got a

688
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,600
strangle on the market why would you

689
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,339
need bang and she said because people

690
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,099
are asking for it that's the right

691
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:34,139
response that I want to hear we did a

692
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:35,158
licensing agreement with them versus a

693
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,299
JV

694
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,000
um

695
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:41,220
it's just

696
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,200
the the players in the marketplace I'm

697
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,500
actually more comfortable licensing to

698
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,500
now

699
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:54,000
royalties they're publicly traded uh

700
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,179
true leave just went public there's

701
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,220
there's a lot more confidence that this

702
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,259
is not going to be someone that you

703
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,778
gotta you half the babies that you

704
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,879
babysit your brand but them as operators

705
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:07,500
the state's looking over their shoulder

706
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,000
with testing the states looking over

707
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,099
their shoulder with compliance a lot of

708
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,500
that babysitting that we had to do

709
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,019
several years ago we don't have to do

710
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,419
now and we can focus on supporting them

711
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,700
as a brand rather than just making sure

712
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,320
they're doing things right

713
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,419
so what I hear you saying is a few years

714
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,158
ago you really had some risk in who you

715
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,500
license to they can mess it up and you

716
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,880
didn't have the control night there's

717
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,380
enough confidence there's enough

718
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,059
information out there that you're you

719
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,039
can do these deals and pick the right

720
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:37,319
Partners yeah I mean even on testing

721
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:40,140
something simple is having to hound

722
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,759
people we need your lab results

723
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,620
because there was no regulation

724
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,980
mandating them to do it it was us

725
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:48,719
mandating it versus now I simply get a

726
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,400
copy of what they're already sending to

727
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,220
the state and in a lot of cases the

728
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,679
state is picking up

729
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:58,019
that responsibility we still mandate it

730
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,538
as part of our agreements but I don't

731
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:01,980
have to stay on them to do it because in

732
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,140
order to sell the product they already

733
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,519
had to do it for the state just just a

734
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,580
follow-up for you anybody else can weigh

735
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,798
in as well but uh you know we have these

736
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,538
captive States like you mentioned and

737
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,220
some of them are doing uh some of the

738
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:16,079
operators are doing the license deals

739
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,179
like you did with true leaf that you

740
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,579
said but at the same time we're starting

741
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:23,640
to see some of these uh operators

742
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:25,139
multi-state operators go out and buy

743
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,179
brands in the market I'm just curious

744
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,080
what you think about that I mean they're

745
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:32,759
trying to be everything it seems like

746
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,639
I I've always believed do what you do

747
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,579
best and

748
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,220
um you know I I've never been a fan of

749
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:44,639
verticals simply because I I don't think

750
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,860
that as a operator that that's

751
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,778
you can't be a great grower and a great

752
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:50,339
brand Builder and a great retailer and

753
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:51,599
and all the things that come through

754
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:54,058
there

755
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,798
out of the gate now acquiring a bunch of

756
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,139
those things and now I'll use origin

757
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,898
house as a good example they took the

758
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,538
best of each of those levels in their in

759
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:05,879
what they felt and put that together but

760
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:08,339
they kept those teams in place that were

761
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,320
doing those jobs well that makes sense

762
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:13,439
but to come out of the block and say I

763
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,819
can do everything well I I don't think

764
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,519
that's happening so the buying the

765
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,740
brands is building a brand developing a

766
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,960
product is that's a specialized skill

767
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,599
set so they're going to acquire those

768
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,319
items

769
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:31,019
um that they feel they couldn't do as

770
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,939
well on their own just

771
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,379
because it's it's it's economically

772
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,840
sensible they already have a market

773
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,640
share they already have loyal followers

774
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,898
they already have formulas they already

775
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,940
understand and

776
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,739
equipment list everything you need

777
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,440
picking that up and then applying it

778
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,659
into their Market is is a great

779
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,120
opportunity but every company is going

780
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,020
to have a different model and

781
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,819
um

782
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:57,538
you know that's again just one of them

783
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:59,339
so we we actually see as the industry

784
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:00,720
sort of grows

785
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:06,599
um

786
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:08,960
we see sort of roles shrinking and I

787
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,538
think to Scott's point

788
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,919
on the pre-roll side where we co-packed

789
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:19,200
for you know 44 Brands we see folks

790
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:23,580
really slotting into lanes and I agree

791
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,819
that I think vertical integration is uh

792
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:29,038
is just not the way to build great

793
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:31,200
efficient companies it's kind of absurd

794
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,298
frankly if you look across the board at

795
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,960
other Industries

796
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:38,460
so what we do see is we see Brands being

797
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,880
brands

798
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,940
and then working with cultivators as

799
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,799
their processing partners

800
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,860
and then working with a distributor to

801
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:52,220
go and sell their stuff so um

802
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:54,359
that that's what we see is essentially

803
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,038
folks falling into roles they're

804
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,719
becoming a little more granular and

805
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:59,700
defined

806
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,140
okay I think we'll open it up we have a

807
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,880
few minutes left does anybody have any

808
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,640
questions we do let's hear it once again

809
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,179
for Alan and the entire panel it's very

810
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,179
informative

811
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:13,860
all right I'm coming I see you down

812
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,620
there once again please keep your

813
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:19,740
questions brief if you have a long

814
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:22,798
statement write a book here we go

815
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,778
when guy will help you

816
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,480
hi I guess I was a little disappointed

817
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:30,538
in

818
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,538
the future being painted

819
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:35,278
without vertical integration and I'm

820
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:38,460
concerned about it

821
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:41,640
with the opportunity of this being the

822
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,179
people's plant that the big guys are

823
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,320
going to come in and it's going to be

824
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,298
trickle down

825
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,759
which doesn't trickle down and I'm

826
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:53,220
mostly concerned about the farmers so

827
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,859
being a farmer from New York and we are

828
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:59,419
starting a company that has a vertical

829
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:59,418
integration through Partnerships

830
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,640
the comment

831
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,339
because when I see all those big names

832
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,940
it looks like we're going to miss the

833
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:10,980
opportunity to be the people that have a

834
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,860
different economy for the future in the

835
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,259
picture that I just heard

836
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:19,079
I I don't want to say you misheard what

837
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:21,839
I said but vertical actually allows the

838
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,460
farmers to be the farmers and Thrive as

839
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,418
Farmers

840
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,380
um

841
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:31,080
we didn't do and build a farm because

842
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,179
there's a lot of great Farmers that we

843
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:36,298
can build relationships with and support

844
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:39,059
and I I think that that

845
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:41,278
when a large corporation comes in and

846
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:43,980
says we're going to do our own Farm

847
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,500
and our own extraction and our own

848
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,240
production and our own retail that

849
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,159
doesn't acknowledge the fact that

850
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,679
there's already those four groups of

851
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,140
people there that would be better to

852
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:59,100
support and that's Bang's position is

853
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,640
we've never been a farm we won't as

854
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,719
maybe not while I'm in charge but

855
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,880
because we're not Farmers there's

856
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,940
there's great Farmers out there and as a

857
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,338
brand and as a product producer our best

858
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,000
contribution to the industry as a whole

859
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:17,338
in its vertical form is to support those

860
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,918
who are already doing that great not

861
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:21,659
figure out how to make more money by

862
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,338
getting rid of them there's a there's a

863
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:27,240
great opportunity for us to support them

864
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:29,159
and the the idea of vertical integration

865
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,459
is something that the Cannabis invented

866
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,119
Miller doesn't grow wheat Hershey

867
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:38,099
doesn't grow sugar they don't grow

868
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:41,159
Coca-Cola doesn't grow corn that that

869
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:43,260
that companies are successful because

870
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,300
they support Farmers not try to push

871
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,520
them out by doing it themselves so I I

872
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,240
hope that's not what you heard as my

873
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,679
position Scott I'm over here

874
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,079
the ghost in the back

875
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,700
um how can smaller Farmers or smaller

876
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,739
businesses work with some of these

877
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,419
larger investment companies and things

878
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:01,979
how do you without getting squeezed out

879
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,440
I mean you say that Coca-Cola doesn't

880
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,800
buy corn syrup but I'm sure they have a

881
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,599
say in the corn prices right and so if

882
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,220
you're not getting as much per acre or

883
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,660
per planter per pound as you were when

884
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,399
you were an independent guy and you got

885
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,559
to work with these bigger things how can

886
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,119
they maximize their profit or their

887
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,179
yield while still working with some of

888
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,858
these larger places so I think um well

889
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:25,858
I've got an answer for you but but I

890
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:28,559
also think that the first step of that

891
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:30,239
is grow really good weed and someone

892
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,219
will watch always the first step that's

893
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,719
always the first step weed sells itself

894
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,719
good first step

895
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,639
um look one thing

896
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:41,459
that the first thing that comes to mind

897
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:45,059
is actually a value proposition that uh

898
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,480
that we explained to all our partners we

899
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:50,159
tell them to you know essentially to

900
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,900
put as much of your weed into into

901
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,420
pre-rolls as you can because you get

902
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:58,740
more for your buck

903
00:35:53,420 --> 00:36:03,480
it's the highest sort of net back out uh

904
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:05,039
for for a cultivation uh essentially so

905
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,639
pre-roll is just

906
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:11,279
back out they penciled the best so you

907
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,098
take your small buds and you make them

908
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,220
worth more than your really nice colas

909
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:19,200
by putting them into pre-rolls simple

910
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:22,039
answer

911
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,039
hi I'm

912
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,380
seeing and wanting ownership information

913
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,338
and this is a coming from the California

914
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,079
permanent regulations that just were

915
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:36,420
released regarding

916
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,680
you know it was an issue if the BCC

917
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,358
wasn't going to allow California

918
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,799
companies to license in other states and

919
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,380
it turns out they probably just want the

920
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,240
ownership information but you know I

921
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,500
just want to know how you guys had come

922
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,838
across that if there were any issues

923
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,079
around that

924
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:55,078
I I honestly I'm haven't

925
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,420
uh my very quick answer to that is along

926
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,160
the years we've had to adjust our

927
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,338
licensing agreement sometimes they were

928
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:05,460
a per unit fee sometimes it was a

929
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:08,159
percentage of sales so part of that was

930
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:12,358
understanding how you can operate within

931
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:14,460
the confines of the regulatory issues

932
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,098
um or I'm sorry within the regulations

933
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,838
and in some cases we ended up not doing

934
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:22,559
licensing agreements because there was

935
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:24,358
not a way to do it that was within the

936
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,820
confines of state law we would have been

937
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:28,500
considered an effective owner and would

938
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,780
have had to go on their documentation as

939
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,639
an owner of their license or a purchase

940
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,839
you know a portion of their license and

941
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,460
in that case

942
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,440
they put up all this money for a license

943
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,019
they are not going to have us be an

944
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,240
owner of their license so

945
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,179
um I think you got to work within each

946
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,858
State's regulations and in some cases

947
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,000
that means you don't get to go play in

948
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:51,619
that sandbox

949
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,500
yeah so uh basically that was the answer

950
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:58,500
essentially you have to back out state

951
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,980
by state and basically put the puzzle

952
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,838
together and it a lot of it is basically

953
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,760
reformatting your the pay structure the

954
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,799
compensation structure it's either a

955
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,880
percentage or a flat fee

956
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
um

957
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,079
or the selling of materials so it's just

958
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,720
it's getting creative to sort of back

959
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,260
into whatever that jurisdiction uh wants

960
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:18,259
it to look like
