it's gonna have to be Steven please tell

63
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:30,189
us about the Canadian Medical landscape

64
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:32,439
from the patient perspective hello

65
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:34,270
everybody thanks for your time I've been

66
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,270
a medical cannabis patient for about

67
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,760
seven years now and I did notice that

68
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,570
there was quite a lot of accessibility

69
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,590
problems in Canada I come from a world

70
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,959
where were there second we are the

71
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,120
second largest consumer of opioids and

72
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,439
I've personally seen it ravage a few

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,460
families including some of my own

74
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:57,669
members and I do believe that cannabis

75
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,680
has a massive potential to be able to

76
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:03,429
curb the opioid epidemic that's now

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,250
moving globally seven years ago I had

78
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,710
sustained a very traumatic injury that

79
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,330
had put me on the equivalent of six

80
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,879
milligrams of dilaudid every four hours

81
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,880
for those of you that aren't familiar

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,389
with dilaudid it is worth for every one

83
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,039
milligram of morphine dilaudid is sorry

84
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:22,839
for every five point five milligrams of

85
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,129
morphine is the equivalent of one

86
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,259
milligram of dilaudid

87
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,519
so to transfer that to recreational use

88
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:30,099
from what I've been told by physicians

89
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,250
as a recreational user would use two

90
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,349
milligrams of dilaudid to get high so

91
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,689
essentially I was taking enough to get

92
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:41,439
high three times every four hours

93
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:45,069
I had a three-month prescription and I

94
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,319
truly found that that was overkill and

95
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,359
many people were not able to get off

96
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,620
that type of addiction I was in a

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,540
privileged position to be able to do

98
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,780
that and I'd love to touch on that story

99
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:58,090
in a bit however with respect to the

100
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,280
medical the medical landscape in Canada

101
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,930
we did notice that there was not enough

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,239
education there was not enough

103
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,550
accessibility and there was not enough

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,219
physicians that were knowledgeable or

105
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,290
comfortable enough to be able to

106
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,780
prescribe cannabis it's still a

107
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:15,340
relatively unknown substance back seven

108
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,250
years ago there was less than 5% of

109
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,949
physicians prescribing as of last year I

110
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,779
believe there was nine and we are now I

111
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,759
believe not working linearly

112
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,829
but exponentially and starting to find

113
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,949
that we are almost at 20% of physicians

114
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:34,008
that are more comfortable prescribing so

115
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,710
as I I don't I certainly don't want to

116
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,419
take any aggressive credit for this but

117
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,519
I do strongly believe that educational

118
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:42,109
clinics and support networks like hello

119
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,139
cannabis and many other clinics that are

120
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,538
available and spreading and growing in

121
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,060
Canada will help these physicians get

122
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:51,740
educated and will be able to help them

123
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,720
provide better duty of care for their

124
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,478
patients and will ultimately allow for

125
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,280
greater access and dr. JZ had the

126
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,589
perfect segue into this as he was

127
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,138
stating that education is absolutely

128
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:05,538
pivotal in order to help distinguish

129
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,210
cannabis and to be able to help patients

130
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:10,668
get access to this and I truly believe

131
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:12,888
that cannabis should potentially be the

132
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:15,439
first step to pain medication as opposed

133
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,750
to an exit to medication to deal with

134
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,399
symptoms from opioid addiction which is

135
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:25,728
often the first step that physicians are

136
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:28,098
using to cope to treat from from the

137
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:29,089
doctor Grinspoon the same question but

138
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:32,120
maybe from from the physician

139
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:35,029
perspective my interest in cannabis

140
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,060
started when I realized that in my

141
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:40,038
hometown of Hamilton Ontario at least

142
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,000
one person died every day from opiates

143
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:46,068
in Vancouver British Columbia up to ten

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,009
people die every day from opiates and

145
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,960
the scary number is in the United States

146
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,449
I've heard numbers up to every three

147
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,879
weeks the same number of people die from

148
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:58,639
opiates that died in the 9/11 Twin Tower

149
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:02,389
disaster but up to 2,700 people every

150
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,699
three weeks 88 people a day so I knew we

151
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,468
had to do something about opiates the

152
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:09,050
other thing is our College of Physicians

153
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:12,949
and Surgeons have come up with

154
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,718
regulations and guidelines and in Berea

155
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,460
they did a study a good study

156
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:19,129
evidence-based study where they

157
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:22,430
determined 100 milligrams a day or Fein

158
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:24,589
or that equivalent is safe so in Ontario

159
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,139
they arbitrarily said if a hundred

160
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:29,359
milligrams a day is safe in British

161
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,728
Columbia the 90 milligrams will be safe

162
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,169
in Ontario so we have to get our

163
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:35,168
patients off opiates and

164
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,450
we need we need to use other natural

165
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,210
health products in cannabis is obviously

166
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,069
great opportunity but as a as a general

167
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:47,789
practitioner I'm a generalist I'm not a

168
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,810
specialist and I needed to rely on

169
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,720
educational clinics to educate my

170
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,629
patients and that's why I've looked -

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,550
hello cannabis - help me learn about

172
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:01,750
cannabis and help my patients learn

173
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,060
about cannabis amazing Bubba this one's

174
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,069
going to be for you pal from your unique

175
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,819
perspective why do you feel that

176
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,219
education is so important for patients

177
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:16,060
right now with what's happening with

178
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,640
with the stigma of cannabis what we're

179
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,220
finding out is that our patient age is

180
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,659
about 54 to 60 years old as our average

181
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,640
patient age coming into the clinics

182
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,410
right now and so there's a huge need for

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,060
information we're taking a look at a

184
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,220
generation of people that have grown up

185
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,629
through this cannabis prohibition who

186
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,940
have been told that cannabis is the

187
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,829
worst thing you could ever do and now

188
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,540
they're starting to turn around and as

189
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,909
we share this amazing information and

190
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,710
the right information educate people

191
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,990
we're having them turn around and say

192
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,549
well maybe I'd like to take a look at it

193
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,500
and in Canada we're in sort of a neat

194
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,230
spot right now as we as we start to look

195
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,759
at legalization there's a lot of

196
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,980
information being shared and it's our

197
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,269
job as well to take a look at that

198
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,819
information that's being shared on

199
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:59,349
Facebook or wherever it is and do the

200
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,579
research because there's a lot of false

201
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,439
information that's going on out there

202
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,870
right now as well and the problem is

203
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,819
that we're so quick to just press end or

204
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,139
Oh Ben's my friend and I love Ben he

205
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,149
always prints funny stuff so I'm just

206
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,709
gonna send it well we got to start

207
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,089
taking a look at those articles because

208
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,949
we're sending a lot of false information

209
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:17,079
out there and it's actually setting us

210
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,550
back the more we can talk about it the

211
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,319
more we can have conversation about it

212
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,520
we're just gonna find that more

213
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,550
physicians are getting into it I

214
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,500
recently just had a back surgery I was

215
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,949
on not as bad as Stephen but I was on

216
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,229
gabapentin 1200 milligrams of naproxen

217
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,250
hydromorphone cotan hydromorphone PMS

218
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,919
and

219
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,599
and another pill as well and I started

220
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,269
using the cannabis oils I got off of the

221
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,669
1,200 milligrams of naproxen almost

222
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,460
within two weeks and the hydromorphone

223
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:47,679
made me so dumb and fuzzy-headed I

224
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,750
started I started vaping a high CBD

225
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,819
cannabis at a low temperature for

226
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,309
breakthrough pain it took me off six

227
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,900
extra pills a day just by being able to

228
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,549
do that so it's having these

229
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:58,959
conversations everybody telling her

230
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:01,059
stories sharing their stories about

231
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,980
cannabis and really just opening up that

232
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:04,569
conversation it's that's what's gonna

233
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,000
help us right now and we're finding I

234
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,070
spoke to two physicians while I was

235
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,929
going through my surgeon is now on board

236
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,450
with us he's prescribing cannabis

237
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:16,299
he's using hello cannabis to educate his

238
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,610
patients now he's off toxins they're

239
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,859
actually starting a he just sent me this

240
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,350
yesterday they're starting a clinical

241
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,389
study on prescriptions in the orthopedic

242
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,340
settings on cannabis and treating

243
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:29,649
musculoskeletal

244
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,940
this is just from a conversation where

245
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,039
we started talking about cannabis

246
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,690
educating and now we're getting clinical

247
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,110
studies done right in our backyard it's

248
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,110
pretty amazing

249
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,269
yeah please put your hands together now

250
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,460
that was literally yesterday I cried a

251
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,279
little it was pretty big

252
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,660
I was also what add one more clinical

253
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,620
trial that we're doing actually do

254
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:57,639
research in the delivery of cannabis but

255
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,460
the reason that there hasn't been

256
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:04,210
tremendous clinical trials so far is

257
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:06,910
because and still is cannabis is illegal

258
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,769
and so it's hard to do large clinical

259
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:10,299
trials however there have been lots of

260
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,210
trials around the world particularly

261
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:16,419
here in Germany there's there's evidence

262
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,060
out of Australia in Israel we're

263
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,679
starting a clinical trial on using

264
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:23,949
cannabis for acute pain management

265
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,929
following surgery as well under the

266
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,050
Chief of Surgery at Saint Joseph's

267
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:31,269
Hospital in Hamilton so we're very

268
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:34,569
excited about that it's starting and it

269
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,610
will happen these trials are are

270
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,410
happening all around the world and it's

271
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,419
our job out there as the cannabis

272
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:42,370
advocates in us to start sharing that

273
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:44,169
information we don't we don't work at

274
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,269
hello cannabis and say we want to be the

275
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,979
only

276
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,169
Cannabis education clinic we want

277
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,580
everybody out there educating so this

278
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,719
conference in places like this are

279
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,820
amazing because we can start sharing

280
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,639
that information a study that happens in

281
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,500
Germany is equally as important in

282
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,879
Canada so we need to start sharing that

283
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,200
information and getting the good stuff

284
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:07,500
out there so that people can see the

285
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:09,840
difference Stephen why is education

286
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,039
important for patient access from your

287
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,350
perspective so I I'll touch on a very

288
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,849
personal story in to be candid this is

289
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,090
actually the first time that I've said

290
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:23,100
it in a public public setting it was a

291
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,050
rather humbling experience if you can

292
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,629
put all of these stereotypes together I

293
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,009
grew up as an investment banker I was a

294
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:31,200
chartered still am a chartered

295
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,179
investment manager I was a derivatives

296
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,940
trader and portfolio manager for RBC

297
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,709
Dominion securities candidly it's it's

298
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,930
the largest investment firm and in

299
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,720
Canada and was it was quite young at

300
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:45,659
that captain of the city championship

301
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,600
soccer team again you can my head didn't

302
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:51,689
fit through doors I was an avid climber

303
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,490
I was very good at one point and a for a

304
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,030
split second I was very very bad at it

305
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,710
and I fell 22 feet the injury I suffered

306
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,879
was called bilateral calcaneus fractures

307
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:06,269
in layman's terms I shattered my feet I

308
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:08,519
was by myself I was able to get carried

309
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,730
out i thankfully spent six months in a

310
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,960
wheelchair and 17 screws was was what

311
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,840
was required to put my feet together

312
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,700
that are still present to this day my

313
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,259
orthopedic surgeon who's actually

314
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,900
participating this clinical trial he's

315
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,840
the number one number one person on that

316
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,189
list I had stated that this is arguably

317
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,570
one of most painful surgeries that you

318
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,490
can endure it's essentially getting

319
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,410
nailed to the cross 17 times with metal

320
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,919
screws it's it was rather excruciating

321
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:36,029
so I came out of this and I touched on

322
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,709
this earlier where I was taking six

323
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,709
milligrams of dilaudid every single four

324
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:43,200
hours I was literally in a comatose I

325
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,300
had spent seven days complete hospital

326
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,790
bed I was able to get transition to my

327
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,129
home where I was more or less a

328
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:51,679
horizontal for 23 hours a day and

329
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:54,629
literally had to relearn how to time

330
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,859
queerly and learn to walk by by crawling

331
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:59,200
first

332
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,560
had I known that cannabis would have

333
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,320
been able to help offset the damage and

334
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,699
addiction that comes with opioids your

335
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,940
you would damn well bet that I would

336
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,680
have done this so I'm extremely grateful

337
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,350
that we are now working with the

338
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,079
orthopedic society to look at using

339
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,300
cannabis as a way to curb and

340
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,470
potentially marginally disrupt the

341
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,929
amount of opioids that are being

342
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,090
required for excruciating surgeries that

343
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:29,559
will cause a lot of chronic pain and

344
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:32,530
chronic arthritis PTSD one thing that

345
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,559
I'm very grateful for is I was in a very

346
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:37,569
privileged position I had a I was

347
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,809
working in a very lucrative industry I

348
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,730
had some savings my my friends were able

349
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:44,889
to build a wheelchair ramp for me I had

350
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,180
a I had a family being close and had

351
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:49,360
friends I were able to take care of me

352
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:50,709
and I'm not naive to that fact many

353
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,779
people that come out of these surgeries

354
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,509
are nowhere near as privileged as I am

355
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,970
and say I hung on by a thread I barely

356
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:01,179
actually out of this the vast majority

357
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,500
of people don't and I spent some time to

358
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:05,349
be able to volunteer at the fracture

359
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,120
clinic to try and be able to empower

360
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,450
people and tell them that they actually

361
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,759
can do this and to say that these people

362
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,470
are at rock-bottom is I think a valid

363
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,860
valid statement because I I myself felt

364
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,220
that I was there as well one thing that

365
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,289
that helped me get out of this is when

366
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,820
you were metabolizing a narcotic and

367
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:27,909
you're taking it every single four hours

368
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,920
at about the three-hour mark year of

369
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,850
course you're metabolizing a narcotic

370
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,479
and there was less of it in your system

371
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,779
so pain starts at the same time you were

372
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,779
also

373
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,699
you

374
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:44,559
oh it was about seven weeks into it so

375
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,220
nearly two months when I started

376
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,588
realizing that I was able to tolerate

377
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:55,200
however my cravings were getting larger

378
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,200
and larger so you as your weaning off

379
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,960
[Music]

380
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,960
some way some

381
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:07,620
cravings for the narcotic won by their

382
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,899
being to manage pain and the other to

383
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,450
manage the addiction and I recognize

384
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,789
that my dick starting become more

385
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,530
pronounced for the reasons why what I

386
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,849
couldn't wait for those four hours to be

387
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,579
over

388
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,019
I had a surgical wound that became

389
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,550
infected so I had a nurse that was

390
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,960
visiting me twice a day the dress had

391
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:28,919
and treated with silver nitrate another

392
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,769
wonderfully painful experience and I

393
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,990
realized that I could actually start

394
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:35,460
tolerating this pain so when I realized

395
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,930
that it was the addiction that was

396
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,530
taking over and not the pain manager I

397
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:43,709
quit cold turkey I'm sure you gathered I

398
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:46,589
I'm not a not a large large fella and I

399
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:49,139
dropped 15 pounds in four days I didn't

400
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,879
sleep for four days I'd like to say that

401
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,279
I don't suffer from any chronic mental

402
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,710
health issues rather grounded educated

403
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,199
individual and you completely lose your

404
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:03,629
mind you go into a state of complete

405
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,370
delirium the description that I could

406
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,049
give is eventually going completely

407
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,399
anemic which is something that happened

408
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,949
to be from blood loss as well so I'm

409
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,019
really without feeling it's hopelessness

410
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,600
essentially so this wound care

411
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:18,179
specialist was monitoring me and saw

412
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,740
that I was slipping into a dark hole

413
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,439
literally to the point of brink of death

414
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,389
and said you you need to eat you need to

415
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,250
sleep and I said I can't I would I would

416
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,409
was not physically capable of even

417
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,090
swallowing I could not hold water down

418
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:35,969
there so there was no chance of even

419
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:37,019
processing food so she suggested she's

420
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,460
like if you're not eating you're not

421
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,689
sleeping are you familiar with cannabis

422
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,060
and I said I'm a Dutch guy from

423
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,920
Vancouver but unfortunately we got we

424
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,229
got drug tested at the investment firm

425
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,279
and I was naive enough to think that I

426
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,519
was going to be a professional soccer

427
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,110
player one day so he didn't I I I didn't

428
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,779
I didn't use cannabis recreationally

429
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,779
anymore so she's like a dear friends and

430
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:00,059
I said probably probably 9 out of 10 so

431
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,339
I made a phone call and I'm sorry dr.

432
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:06,509
Greenspan I I know I know position it

433
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:08,130
would condone smoking cannabis I'm not

434
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:10,170
going to argue that you can't derive

435
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,380
medicinal benefits from smoking cannabis

436
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,089
but it's

437
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,640
not a healthy way of inducing this

438
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:17,048
medicine so anyways that is what I did I

439
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,059
called a friend and he came over with a

440
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:21,038
bong and some cannabis and I smoked and

441
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:23,889
next thing that happened is I slapped

442
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,679
and then I ate and then I smoked again

443
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,460
and I slapped and I ate and I repeated

444
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:33,038
that for about five days and four days

445
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,470
of absolute rock bottom hell was offset

446
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,450
by six days of blissful cannabis and

447
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,750
reading and videogames it was it was

448
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,250
quite a nice change in my life I was

449
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:48,548
very good at Skyrim by the way I killed

450
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:51,220
a lot of dragons so I came from a

451
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:53,048
position of privilege and I barely got

452
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,079
through this and the opioid epidemic is

453
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:58,900
is real I particularly in North America

454
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:01,029
it's rampant and we started this

455
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,350
campaign to be able to help educate

456
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:05,139
people and be able to help bringing more

457
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:07,509
physicians into this and now we're at a

458
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,038
point where we have orthopedic surgeons

459
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:13,929
that are looking at substituting the

460
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:16,629
narcotics like like dilaudid with

461
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:18,759
cannabis use so access is starting to

462
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,200
get there back when I needed to get a

463
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,779
prescription after the meeting this

464
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,960
nurse practitioner that said you should

465
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:29,168
get cannabis I had to literally find a

466
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,480
doctor I paid I wired four hundred and

467
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:33,038
fifty dollars Canadian to them and it

468
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,819
was a Skype conversation with the doctor

469
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,019
from BC the College of Physicians

470
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:42,009
extremely frown frowns upon this

471
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:44,558
extremely so it was a a quote unquote

472
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:46,569
shady deal this was a real doctor was a

473
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,569
real prescription and I still hold it to

474
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:51,339
this day but that's not access and I

475
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:53,379
would not have known about this if I did

476
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:56,288
not have a massive infection in my wound

477
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,450
and had a nurse that was educated on

478
00:18:56,288 --> 00:19:02,079
cannabis and had seen her own anecdotal

479
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,210
evidence that it works so I that is

480
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,609
again why I would emphasize that access

481
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,048
is extremely important and the more that

482
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:10,029
we can educate physicians and the more

483
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:12,279
that we can talk about Ray's like this

484
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,440
and go beyond anecdotal evidence that

485
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,750
people like dr. Grinspoon season is back

486
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,029
door backyard and started actually being

487
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,369
able to get clinical trials we can make

488
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,960
a dramatic impact on arguably one of the

489
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,619
biggest epidemics that we are facing in

490
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,069
the medical world

491
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:29,079
right now so now thankfully in Canada

492
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:31,629
we've been marginally disrupting this by

493
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,429
educating more physicians and I think we

494
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,280
are at almost 20 percent of physicians

495
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,808
that are comfortable with this and if

496
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,990
they are now comfortable prescribing it

497
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:43,839
I we have not heard from one that is not

498
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,279
comfortable referring a patient to us to

499
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,558
be able to take on that educational

500
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,190
component and be that duty of care for

501
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:53,170
for their patient so access was very

502
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,299
difficult seven years ago in Canada and

503
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,100
I believe Germany is probably about

504
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:00,190
where we are at about three four five

505
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:02,799
years ago and that can change if you are

506
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,500
looking at people that have experience

507
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,700
in this with respect to education they

508
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,558
have the materials they have the

509
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,390
guidance we learned the hard way by

510
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,149
trying to figure out how patient flow in

511
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,460
traffic works and we've discovered a

512
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,380
bottle that that actually works and we

513
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,660
have seen now with over a thousand

514
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,390
patients in over 30 referring physicians

515
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,279
I think nine prescribing let alone the

516
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,980
the 19 surgeons I just signed up for

517
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:29,349
this clinical trial that we've made a

518
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,920
positive impact on that and that was the

519
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:34,750
genuine goal from day one and cannabis I

520
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,179
do not want to be melodramatic and say

521
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,829
cannabis saved my life but if you were

522
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:40,300
to ask me what the inflection point was

523
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:42,490
from my recovery

524
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,319
it was quitting alloys and then four

525
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,359
days later using cannabis to curb the

526
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,980
symptoms of quitting opioids and that's

527
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,289
how I'm able to stand here to this day

528
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,058
and still play competitive soccer and

529
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:54,039
live a life as opposed to being a

530
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:57,420
synthetic heroin addict so thank you

531
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,420
cannabis and thank you Germany

532
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:05,660
okay please please following Stephen is

533
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,210
a hard act to follow but in fact it's

534
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:11,990
not a smart thing to do I don't consider

535
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,640
myself a smart doctor in fact in fact

536
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,370
what do they call the dumbest kid in

537
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:26,450
your medical school class dr. who

538
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:28,308
exactly scary so but just some more

539
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,690
anecdotal evidence there's a dr. Lydia

540
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:32,058
Hatcher she's the head of the pain

541
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,130
clinic at McMaster University she has

542
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:37,460
somewhere between 500 and a thousand

543
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:41,110
patients on cannabis she's been able to

544
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:45,529
reduce her opiate juice by 67% and her

545
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:48,229
benzodiazepine by 43% further to dr.

546
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:50,539
jay-z's recommendations more than half

547
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:55,640
the people that have an accidental or

548
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:57,519
intentional overdose of opiates are on a

549
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,570
combination of an opiate plus a

550
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,869
benzodiazepine like valium lorazepam

551
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:05,750
clonazepam it's so important that we get

552
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:09,259
these people off drugs yet it's my

553
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,940
responsibility as a physician to provide

554
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:13,129
education to the patients when I

555
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,630
prescribe it and there's lots of you out

556
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,300
there who know a lot more than cannabis

557
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,309
about cannabis than I do so that's why I

558
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,769
turn to Stephen Stephen I want to

559
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:24,349
prescribe cannabis but I need your help

560
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:26,599
to educate the patients and to educate

561
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:28,730
me and that's what hello cannabis has

562
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:31,279
done for me and that's what

563
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,150
hello cannabis international will do for

564
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,149
everyone here too

565
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:39,519
[Music]

566
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm gonna open this one up to the whole

567
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,960
panel I didn't I'm just curious to know

568
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,029
how would any of you approach a

569
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,600
physician who was a opposed to cannabis

570
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:50,950
to maybe open their minds I mean and

571
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,319
there's several ways to do it for me it

572
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,940
was just simple conversation with

573
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,829
positions whenever I am going to meet

574
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,500
them sort of feel them out and see how

575
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:01,659
they are feeling about cannabis the next

576
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,490
step is to just start throwing as much

577
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,870
anecdotal evidence as humanly possible

578
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,029
into the conversation well I have four

579
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:08,559
minutes in front of them and then from

580
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:10,269
that point it's hopefully being able to

581
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,159
get another physician like dr. Greenspan

582
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,319
to be able and go and have that

583
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,330
conversation and seal the deal and by

584
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,799
sharing resources and sharing physicians

585
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:19,029
that's how we're gonna keep building

586
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,950
this community and how we're going to

587
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:22,509
keep educating and I just really

588
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,519
everybody's been stressing it this week

589
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:27,369
and it's been amazing it's all about

590
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,500
education the more we talk the more we

591
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:31,119
stifle misinformation and the more we

592
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:36,430
get it out there we're gonna make it a

593
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:38,199
lot easy for all of ourselves maybe you

594
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,759
can talk to us and all of you are going

595
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,920
to open them to the panel but talk to us

596
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,410
about about how hello cannabis has had

597
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,600
an impact on accessibility in our area

598
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:51,820
and has impacted patients and physicians

599
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:54,669
in the medical space so I we've touched

600
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:56,139
on some of these numbers in previous

601
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,570
discussions that we've had today but we

602
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,759
have seen firsthand the impact just

603
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:03,460
within three hospitals and five medical

604
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:05,769
centers that we are in as soon as we are

605
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,190
able to get one physician to be able to

606
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:11,799
open up and start sending patients to us

607
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:14,650
typically a prescription ranges anywhere

608
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,909
from three to twelve months we've kept

609
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,170
it at three months so that way we were

610
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,570
able to keep on top of these patients

611
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:22,150
and be able to actually track how they

612
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:24,460
are doing and what titration methods

613
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:28,030
they are using and be able to as dr. JZ

614
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,309
said go go low and slow when those

615
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:32,799
patients come back and all that dr.

616
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:34,569
Greene's been touched on this I will say

617
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,879
firsthand that we were seeing a dramatic

618
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:38,250
dramatic positive impact we're seeing a

619
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,880
massive reduction in

620
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:45,240
in in painkillers we are now seeing

621
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,770
patients using this for insomnia this

622
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,579
was something that I suffered from back

623
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:52,408
when I was trading on Bay Street I would

624
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,970
not be able to sleep and I would just

625
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:56,039
use stare at your alarm clock I'm like

626
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,690
holy crap it's 3:00 a.m. I got to wake

627
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,089
up in two hours like this is nuts

628
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,490
and you still show up and you work and

629
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:04,889
you look like a heroin addict just from

630
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,990
just from insomnia so I was prescribed

631
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,120
something called zombie clone and my

632
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,490
family physician said that this is a

633
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,529
non-addictive safe in our safe

634
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,490
prescription for you it's going to be

635
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:20,519
far better for you then than any any

636
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,710
other sleep aid and I recently found out

637
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,329
from new evidence that had come out this

638
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,250
is going that was prescribed this 10

639
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:28,769
years ago is that you were not supposed

640
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,019
to use this this prescription for more

641
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:34,019
than a week and I had a six-month supply

642
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:37,259
of it using and they wanted me to use

643
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:39,740
this daily so when we keep talking about

644
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:41,640
misinformation these are things that

645
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,950
cannabis has been able to completely

646
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,538
replace my mother who's never been

647
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,210
intoxicated in her entire life he

648
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:49,980
suffers from hypertension and insomnia

649
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:53,190
and now it takes a one-to-one CBD THC

650
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,599
oil and quote-unquote she says I have

651
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,870
happy dreams that I've never slept so

652
00:25:54,599 --> 00:26:00,119
well in my life now us getting into

653
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:02,250
these medical centers and meeting one

654
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,469
physician and being able to talk either

655
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,909
about my own personal story or to be

656
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,620
able to get an in through one of our

657
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:10,200
strategic partners we have an advisory

658
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,119
board with six physicians that love our

659
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,470
story believe in our story and I've seen

660
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,750
the evidence seeing the impact it's had

661
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,038
on their practice they open up the door

662
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,288
saw their physicians for us

663
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,509
unfortunately physicians aren't overly

664
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:23,460
open to talking to business and like

665
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,140
myself you do have to have an

666
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,750
introduction from another physician so

667
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,150
that that was kind of our our ticket in

668
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,460
to be able to start helping access and

669
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,740
getting this penetration of physicians

670
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,840
to start looking at this and in our own

671
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,460
backyard we have now seen a dramatic

672
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,230
increase in the amount of physicians

673
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,640
that are prescribing and the amount of

674
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,740
physicians that are sending us patients

675
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,500
for referrals our business has been

676
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,190
growing literally

677
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,109
exponentially and I'm Richard we're

678
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,420
having a time keeping up with the demand

679
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,339
of patients that are trying to get

680
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,860
either get off of opioids or looking at

681
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:58,659
natural health products to replace these

682
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:01,089
synthetic products that are in my

683
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,450
opinion absolutely decimating our

684
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:06,669
population so we our evidence is

685
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,960
unfortunately anecdotal I promise you

686
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,630
when we are here next year we will have

687
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,370
clinical trial evidence and we will be

688
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,320
able to actually show real figures as to

689
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:18,129
how many people we have been able to

690
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:20,379
help I promise you that the impact is

691
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,630
massive are we look we come from a city

692
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,280
of 600,000 people and I could say that

693
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,940
we have firsthand already had a material

694
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:32,230
impact there in less than one year

695
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:34,539
absolutely just to reinforce Stephens

696
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,579
statement in my old my old position I

697
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:38,319
did some PR work and for some

698
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:41,409
dispensaries when the dispensary model

699
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,740
went the way it did in Ontario I moved

700
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,690
into legal work but one of my duties

701
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,299
there was to manage their social media

702
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,390
and literally dozens and dozens of

703
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,099
messages would come in a week thanking

704
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,940
the company in question MMJ Canada it

705
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:59,049
was allowing access it was getting them

706
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,789
off of opioids it was getting them off

707
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:03,279
junk that was their their term is

708
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:05,529
getting them off even alcohol so Harlech

709
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,149
education is definitely key to harm

710
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:08,529
reduction and that's a good look for

711
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,490
everybody in cannabis everybody who's in

712
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,569
this industry this is something we

713
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,569
should all get behind from my

714
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:14,710
perspective that being said we're gonna

715
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:18,009
come to the question and answer portion

716
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:20,400
of the panel I believe we have any

717
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:20,400
questions

718
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:29,069
let's hear it again for the panel once

719
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:30,679
again fantastic anyone have any

720
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:33,058
questions

721
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,038
take your time I know you've probably

722
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:38,608
had an edible or - after lunch there we

723
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:41,158
go okay I should probably know this and

724
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:44,249
I will look at your website but can you

725
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,489
can you tell me a little bit more about

726
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:49,829
hello cannabis how you're funded

727
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:51,239
structured etc yeah I certainly don't

728
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,699
mind sharing the the business model

729
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:55,079
behind us as I was saying before in

730
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,028
order for me to get a cannabis

731
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,189
prescription I had to I had to pays a

732
00:28:57,028 --> 00:29:01,618
wire transfer to a physician across

733
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,469
literally across the country and then be

734
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:08,338
connected via the a Skype broadcast

735
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:10,499
which was quite strange to me and in in

736
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:13,200
all of Canada we have we have access to

737
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:15,088
medication and no HIPPA free of charge I

738
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,889
believe that needs to be conducive with

739
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:18,058
cannabis as well and that was one of the

740
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,738
major reasons why we still have a

741
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:22,348
difficulty a difficult time with

742
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:24,538
accessibility so our services are

743
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:27,960
completely free we are funded in

744
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:30,058
financed by licensed producers many of

745
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,579
them are their business model is of

746
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:35,398
course to be able to help patients and

747
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:38,218
patients purchase cannabis from them so

748
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,658
as we are sourcing specific products

749
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:41,609
that we believe have the highest

750
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,950
efficacy for specific ailments and this

751
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:45,689
is data that we are mining as fast and

752
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:48,869
furiously as possible to be able to help

753
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,088
physicians like dr. Grinspoon find the

754
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:53,249
best product for the specific ailment of

755
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:55,739
each individual person I do believe that

756
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:59,759
that's a paramount licensed producers

757
00:29:55,739 --> 00:30:03,179
compensate us for those referrals I do

758
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,368
believe that I was taking these for pill

759
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,409
these sorry six pills every single four

760
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:10,138
hours you metabolize narcotics

761
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,969
differently hourly daily and there are

762
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:13,678
so many variables that will change how

763
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:15,558
you metabolize in narcotic whether it's

764
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,369
sleep whether it's how much you've ate

765
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:21,058
so when people when you were

766
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:22,918
self-medicating with cannabis as jay-z

767
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:26,098
doctor jay-z touched on this again cod I

768
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:29,639
love saying that name it's great Oh dr.

769
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:31,138
jay-z touched on this as well and to go

770
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:32,599
low and slow but there are so many

771
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:35,089
different variables that can affect

772
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,740
how cannabis will metabolize and how it

773
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:38,359
will affect you psycho actively so

774
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,309
that's why I think having a company like

775
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,990
hello cannabis to be able to help those

776
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,460
people on that journey and be a resource

777
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,650
we have live chat immediately on our

778
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,660
website with patients have full

779
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,910
excessive access to be able to talk to

780
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,830
one of our educators we are all medical

781
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:56,390
cannabis users we all understand self

782
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:58,339
medication and I truly believe that you

783
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,890
will metabolize a narcotic differently

784
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:02,269
based on stress sleep and many many many

785
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,000
other variables so it does require

786
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:06,559
multiple touches so to provide those

787
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,869
services we get compensated through

788
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,960
licensed producers the company was

789
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:13,039
founded and self-funded so it was

790
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,930
bootstrapped and

791
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,420
grown literally from the ground up with

792
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:20,180
just say a few a few decent contacts my

793
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,710
black book of contacts and a cell phone

794
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,440
in the couch and that was that was a

795
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,990
couple years ago and now it's grown to a

796
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,940
hello cannabis international where we

797
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,960
are we're open and I've already started

798
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,450
providing some of our services in Europe

799
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,370
the clouds in the world as to just add

800
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,100
something to that you know when a

801
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:43,849
patient comes in to see me because they

802
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:45,919
can't sleep and I decide to prescribe a

803
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:47,750
form of valium let's say lorazepam to

804
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,000
help them sleep it's it's a controlled

805
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,490
substance I talked to them about the

806
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,519
risks and the benefits and then I

807
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:58,460
prescribed it I don't charge the patient

808
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,289
for that service it's part of the

809
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,259
Ontario health insurance plan it's free

810
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:05,629
they they have a number so if somebody

811
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:08,720
needs cannabis the same argument goes

812
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,030
it's a controlled substance I the risks

813
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,610
and the benefits and then I prescribe it

814
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,549
why should I charge them for cannabis

815
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:18,439
but I haven't charged them for valium so

816
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:20,419
the College frowns upon charging

817
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,490
patients for cannabis a lot of doctors

818
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,880
still do and they're subject to a

819
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:30,109
complaint they're in trouble

820
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,970
hello cannabis allows me to to make the

821
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:34,309
prescription send the patient to the

822
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,500
educational clinic that does a lot of

823
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:40,099
the work for me so so that I don't have

824
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,599
to spend the extra time myself I also

825
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:44,859
should tell you that I've been a doctor

826
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:47,558
for 40 more than 40 years

827
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:50,740
I had delivered babies for 35 years more

828
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:51,579
than 3,500 babies the nicest patients

829
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,079
I've ever met

830
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:56,048
are the cannabis patients they're

831
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:57,970
usually a bit older 55 60 they need

832
00:32:56,048 --> 00:33:00,879
education they're the nicest patients

833
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:02,679
that I have and back to the back to the

834
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,170
original business model and what you

835
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,500
guys are saying is they'll pay $300 go

836
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:10,870
see a physician and then you're forced

837
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,420
to buy your cannabis through one conduit

838
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,859
and what we've realized is that

839
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,390
everybody's symptoms are different

840
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,428
everybody's ailments are different and

841
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,559
in Canada were so blessed to have so

842
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,600
much amazing medicine from now I think

843
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,690
as of this week 93 licensed producers

844
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:27,548
that it's actually unethical for us to

845
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,410
force somebody down one conduit and

846
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:31,389
that's why we started searching out for

847
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,769
these different relationships so that we

848
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,570
can go and find the absolute best

849
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,069
medicine for our patients and take care

850
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:38,950
of them if somebody doesn't like the

851
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:40,480
flavor of their CBD oil well we'll move

852
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,400
them over to someone like tilray who's

853
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,230
coming out with capsules we have that

854
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,000
ability and by hitting that touch point

855
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,829
following up holistically with those

856
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,089
patients at three months we have the

857
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,798
ability to say how's your titration

858
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:52,269
going how are you enjoying your medicine

859
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,859
are you finding that it's working for

860
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:55,569
you would you like us to switch your

861
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:57,099
prescription to another licensed

862
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:59,439
producer because we can do that for you

863
00:33:57,099 --> 00:34:01,058
as well and by doing that we're giving

864
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,279
that extra attention it comes back to

865
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:04,928
education and those people are going out

866
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,730
and they're having that conversation and

867
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:08,409
when you have 60 year old ladies at

868
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,148
bridge club on Friday night talking

869
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:12,220

870
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,690

00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,029
your physicians to be able to make sure

905
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:47,889
that you don't fall under the exact same

906
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,830
path that North America's fallen under

907
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:52,269
which is an opioid absolute epidemic

908
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:52,920
which is ravaging our countries right

909
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:56,500

910
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,150
well more oh so you guys are you said

911
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,650
your patients all fill out a survey so

912
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,480
you're gonna have more studies and

913
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,160
things how many places do you have right

914
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,750
now I forgot forgive me can you repeat

915
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:06,369
the comments do you have right now that

916
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,599
they're all filling out surveys and four

917
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:12,009
levels so you can thousand patients

918
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,349
through the sorry about a thousand

919
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,610
patients yeah so I we had we had gone

920
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:17,130
through beta testing for about eight

921
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,630
months to make sure that we are actually

922
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,869
our business model had worked and we

923
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:25,570
were able to sustain the growth that I

924
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:27,339
knew was going to become exponential we

925
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:29,830
had a grand opening at our first clinic

926
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,769
about four months ago

927
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:35,650
this has been about a 24 month project

928
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:37,630
that over the last year and a half has

929
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,760
finally kind of come to fruition we are

930
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,700
now adding between 20 and 40 patients

931
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,230
today we had just opened up our teleMed

932
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:47,259
services where we were able to go

933
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:50,260
nationally and because we had

934
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,630
limitations on advertising which Ben had

935
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,160
started it the goodbye opioids campaign

936
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,599
he's quite well connecting the music

937
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,960
industry we're now throwing events

938
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,630
almost on a bi-weekly basis and that is

939
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,849
conducive of hello cannabis and the the

940
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,820
word is spreading rapidly I would not be

941
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,980
surprised if by next

942
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,260
month we are adding 50 patients a day

943
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,460
the goal is 7,500 patients by the end of

944
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,190
the year I think we're gonna smash that

945
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,470
I should mention that that as a doctor

946
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:19,010
we do intakes we do measurable outcomes

947
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:20,959
we actually measure measure their pain

948
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,970
level 75 percent of patients are pain

949
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,030
there's anxiety post-traumatic stress

950
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:27,739
nausea etc but 75 percent of patients

951
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,780
are chronic pain

952
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:31,399
we have measurable outcomes we follow

953
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,950
them every three months we make sure

954
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,639
they're getting better and and that's

955
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:43,939
what hello cannabis does as well okay

956
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:47,210
I'm coming over there be easier if I had

957
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,579
a jet pack I could just float No someone

958
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:53,090
said one for next year maybe a

959
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:55,670
teleportation device hi Steven

960
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:58,059
you just mentioned that you planning to

961
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,430
go to Europe as well and open some

962
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:03,380
subsidiaries you have any idea or in

963
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:07,849
terms of time when you are trying to

964
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:12,200
approach Germany last week thank you

965
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:14,960
very much we've already been approached

966
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:18,109
by four countries so far even just at

967
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,690
this at this event I do believe that we

968
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,190
have the supply the business model and

969
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,369
sustainability to be able to actually

970
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:26,809
bring physicians out and be able to have

971
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,250
speakers to be able to get them out at

972
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:30,710
conventions to be able to get them to

973
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,940
start speaking one-on-one the only thing

974
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,699
that would probably slow us down is the

975
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,280
language barrier unfortunately we are we

976
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:39,919
are a monolingual polyglots like most of

977
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,990
Europe it's rather embarrassing but we

978
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,329
do have physicians that I think are

979
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:49,369
extremely reputable charismatic and are

980
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:50,900
well be able to speak at a very high

981
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:53,690
level to other physicians to educate

982
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:57,260
them in Europe it looks like Lithuania

983
00:38:53,690 --> 00:39:00,429
Denmark and Germany are going to be our

984
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,430
first stops

985
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:08,130
any other questions I'm looking

986
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:10,469
fantastic I don't think anyone has any

987
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:13,440
more questions you guys want to make a

988
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:14,400
