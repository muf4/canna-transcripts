85
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,379
yeah so I would say the position of

86
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,199
Switzerland is very simple we talking

87
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,060
about the law the 1% and it's true but I

88
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,560
think we should speak about the relation

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,800
between the canopy the winds and

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,409
especially the THC to CBD so we all

91
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,400
everybody wants a high CBD breathe and

92
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:16,529
it's very hard to have high CBD with a

93
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,170
very low THC so what we experience

94
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:22,549
ourselves we have about 15 genetic that

95
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,960
we cultivate so our cultivation is

96
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,329
100,000 square feet 10,000 square meter

97
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,019
we do 100

98
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,908
60,000 plant indoor hybrid greenhouse

99
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:34,430
and this is quite large I mean for us

100
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:36,529
it's it's kind of high-tech to handle

101
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:41,329
ads especially in indoor production and

102
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:44,029
when you have a 0.3 0.4 percent THC you

103
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:46,758
will hardly have more than zero seven

104
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:49,098
zero nine nine seven nine percent CBD

105
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,718
and when you have hybrid for example we

106
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:53,240
have an exclusive partnership with Dinah

107
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:55,519
FEM seeds for whole Switzerland and we

108
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,050
have our new genetic design they're

109
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,089
generating the dynamic cash we are

110

launching the ivory delimit cars during

111
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:07,038
the cannot trade and we have 0.8 percent

112
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:09,348
THC for 20% CBD and this is important to

113
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,800
know because you can you can grow higher

114
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:14,718
than 0.2 or 0.6 percent THC in I in

115
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,069

00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:29,218
for halted incurred understand Kedah

168
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:34,468
stop sales airfield knowledge was he

169
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:36,588
ruffled missing what I think they said

170
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:39,209
with everything need to be sailing I

171
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:41,550
mean I don't want to take the time too

172
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,649
much so I think our subject is

173
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,598
trajectory of cannabis in Switzerland we

174
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:47,550
have about thirty minutes so 25 minutes

175
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,819
we need three hour and a half so I mean

176
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,800
let's summarize this the game regards to

177
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,069
the next part of ascent and Alex owned

178
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,079
the opportunities and fetish whites in

179
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,329
fact items are in off power lender I'll

180
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,069
say it in English for you so what what

181
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:05,338
are the opportunities for Switzerland in

182
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:06,649
comparison to our European neighboring

183
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:09,209
countries

184
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:11,879
well the opportunities in Switzerland

185
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:14,639
are very simple at the moment I think is

186
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,499
regarding the law I mean this legal fact

187
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,619
that we can grow and sell legally would

188
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:22,588
less than one percent can be so you can

189
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:24,419
call cannabis ham CB I mean the genetic

190
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,399
we have now on high CBD level and low

191
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:27,838
THC is more cannabis plant than hemp

192
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,658
when you look at the size of the buds

193
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:32,578
and I mean the terpenes and everything

194
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:34,078
is more cannabis plant for me but I know

195
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,370
in states all the people want to speak

196
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,870
about hence since there is this hemp

197
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,509
bill farm

198
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:44,370
passed so I would say in Switzerland

199
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:46,289
everybody knows the wages are expensive

200
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,980
the territory is small so I would not

201
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:52,500
say that we are we have big opportunity

202
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:58,110
in terms of planting and

203
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:00,360
quantity is true that in our in our the

204
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,460
way we function in Switzerland in any

205
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,909
other business so if you take banking

206
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,700
chocolate farmer insurance company I

207
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:11,069
mean we can mention a lot of we can

208
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,580
munch on a lot of names even from the

209
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:17,220
tobacco industry be a TGT is the the

210
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,440
nestle in Switzerland so we have a

211
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,129
mentality where we like to do the right

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,800
thing we are very detail-oriented and

213
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:28,590
it's it's it makes the job more easy

214
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:32,099
because cannabis is like growing

215
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,629
cannabis it's very difficult I mean my

216
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,750
background come from real estate and

217
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:40,590
private equity so we created this group

218
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:44,070
soon two years ago and we have now about

219
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,410
eighteen Arvest as a background and you

220
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,710
can have a lot of issue one let's say

221
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:53,279
mold or different things and you know

222
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:55,320
it's it's very specialized and I said in

223
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,929
Switzerland we had the opportunity to

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,160
find great professional and who learn

225
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:05,699
fast and enable us to do a great job on

226
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,949

278
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,860
we have an expression more in the French

279
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,690
part of citizen so you know it's an

280
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,190
easily divided German part and French

281
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,750
part even asked from Geneva when you

282
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,660
come here we think we need the visa to

283
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,720
come here it's really like two different

284
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:42,579
things and if we say in the our French

285
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,710
part of citizen and we say in

286
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,480
Switzerland is slowly but surely and

287
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,940
this is always like this so the thing is

288
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,350
happening but it takes time and that's

289
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,610
the reason why I had the discussion was

290
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,129
ran out to yesterday about the

291
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,580
Association he's doing and now I mean

292
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:59,230
the main player let's say the top seven

293
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,879
player in Switzerland we kind of linked

294
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,259
together in order to have some meeting

295
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,759
every month so every two months some

296
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:06,340
time every month is not possible because

297
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,100
we have a hassle with the operation but

298
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,889
in order really to see what we can do in

299
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,389
order to push because the politics is

300
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,980
like not only Switzerland everywhere

301
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,870
I've deal with many politics in

302
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,250
different country if you don't push them

303
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:22,549
nothing is happening so I would

304
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,590
through the association about financing

305
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,329
the right research and of course doing

306
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,220
our own research in Switzerland but

307
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,400
relying as well in other country now you

308
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,830
have everywhere in Canada in United

309
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,199
States in in Israel as well a lot of a

310
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,660
lot of research have been done I'm sure

311
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,750
that was the right documentation the

312
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:44,419
right presentation and the right

313
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,029
Association as well we have the

314
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:49,579
opportunity to move to move it forward I

315
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:51,740
mean in any country now we see the

316
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,330
retail the population the politic is

317
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,909
like a couple of people on top the

318
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,300
popular the population is 99 percent so

319
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:00,649
when the population wants or needs or

320
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,539
whatever which it just need to be a

321
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,610
structure in a certain way not in France

322
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:08,120
like Julie Jean because this is not the

323
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,560
way of moving politics intelligently but

324
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,629
I'm sure that if we structure ourselves

325
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,479
in Switzerland the main players and

326
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:17,389
right association we could achieve some

327
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,159
very good results the third class I

328
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,500
can't least write the father nor the

329
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,870
faintest bouncing Nicky stick does this

330
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,450
moment on for all on the cross and

you want me to preserve so I'm talking

402
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,900
about the novel food a situation in

403
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,660
Europe at the moment since Switzerland

404
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,000
is a country that has its own rules but

405
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,970
also is adapting to the EU market and

406
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,289
Nova food is one of those subjects you

407
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,730
know what is it what is it you were

408
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,000
doing or what do you think needs to be

409
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,740
done

410
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,390
what I think is like Switzerland is not

411
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,250
first of all adapting to Europe

412
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,590
otherwise we would be member of European

413
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,329
Union unfortunately or fortunately

414
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:09,928
depending the opinion we are part of

415
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:13,619
Schengen I'm not gonna talk politic here

416
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:15,390
but I would say that as we see at the

417
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:18,029
moment now any product we lounge need to

418
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,700
go through FSB ofsp is like our

419
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:23,519
regulation where whether we do pre-roll

420
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,679
whether we do pouches with shelf bars or

421
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,569
whatever needs to go there and for

422
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,798
example when we add when we launched our

423
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:33,689
pre-rolls the ivory platinum they tax us

424
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,369
like tobacco like cigarettes so we have

425
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,380
to pay the tobacco taxes even on the but

426
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:40,289
any product we need to pay tobacco taxes

427
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,070
and on this there is no tobacco there is

428
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:46,558
only but flowers and they said oh but we

429
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:47,909
don't know is it as cigarillos or is it

430
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,099
a cigarette there is no class

431
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,320
classification so we taxed the harder I

432
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,480
mean Switzerland you have to understand

433
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,829
is one of the only country not one of I

434
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,289
would say even in Europe the only

435
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:00,058
country who is making profit the country

436
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:02,909
is making profit the other people that

437
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,798
are losing huge money each president

438
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,750
every five years making like giving the

439
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,160
hot cake to the other one we are making

440
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,339
money so we are kind of a little bit

441
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,400
structure I think and not stupid in a

442
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:16,199
way that not taking the time to do the

443
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,450
right decision so I'm sure that our

444
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,660
political Switzerland is following the

445
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,429
subject of CBD very closely and it's the

446
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,500
only country for example you drive and

447
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,790
you can find you find CBD everywhere for

448
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,308
the foreigner here the people from

449
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:31,200
Canada for example and I know of

450
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,859
Canadian company and have some friends

451
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,289
here as well

452
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,808
do you go to petrol station you have you

453
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,639
have buds you have won pouches you have

454
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,410
everywhere and just talking about before

455
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,960
the the Canada we're talking about

456
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:46,320
Canada in United States about how

457
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,808
Switzerland should be looking on Canada

458
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,798
or them I say I would say it's dramatic

459
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:54,099
for us because in Canada

460
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,138
they want to build a LP it cost 10,000

461
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:58,808
square meter square feet costs between

462
00:19:56,138 --> 00:20:01,329
35 million to 50 million if you do EU

463
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:03,819
GNP the plans they don't need epoxy

464
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:05,499
floor with chimera with new they don't

465
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:08,079
need all this and it's it's make

466
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:09,850
difficult at the end for the retail for

467
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,829
the consumer because more thing we do

468
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:13,569
like this more product is the cost is

469
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:15,759
expensive and we still need to make

470
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:19,538
profit so that at the end who are paying

471
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:23,259
the bill is the buyers and as I would

472
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:25,200
say we need structure that's for sure gh

473
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,849
is an important can I be knowing I mean

474
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,990
everybody now CBD everywhere it's like

475
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:34,269
the angel and chichi is the devil okay

476
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,368
we can challenge that I mean I think

477
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:40,028
this is based more on the research what

478
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:42,069
is happening now on the on house on

479
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:45,069
possibly healing some cancer or other

480
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:48,460
other thing and we could talk even about

481
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:50,439
cbn CBD cbc and CB i don't know what i

482
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,629
mean there is more than 400 cannabinoids

483
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,669
and i think we should really rely on

484
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:57,209
this research and the big like state

485
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,980
university and all these kind of things

486
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:03,909
to order have to see how we can

487
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,769
structure low well okay i jump a bit

488
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:08,409
from the other each other okay I had in

489
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:12,609
mind that's fine it's an important

490
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:16,600
information let's go back to the subject

00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,120
speaking square feet or square meter

570
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:50,779
English okay 200 we have 280 we have

571
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,269
280,000 square feet

572
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,730
existing which is old facility but our

573
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:58,160
land is one of the biggest constructible

574
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,480

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,870
permission of 2.5 million square feet

577
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,210

578
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:09,769

579
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,069
hand trimmed so when you do hand trim

580
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:16,609
one get one person is doing between 500

581
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:18,230
500 gram to 1 kilo so I think like yeah

582
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:20,439
a couple of hundred people in the group

583
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:24,650
now we are structuring the trading desk

584
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,900
in our company and we have 50 new

585
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,690
traders starting after canna trade

586
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,360
so yeah just dealing with the operation

587
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,070
and whatever the market demand try to

588
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,250
make the best product a good best

589
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:39,019
quality in terms of the buds or in term

590
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,200
of the packaging and anything and just

591
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:44,569
race it there is a race and I have to

592
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,250
say that I see what is happening in

593
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:49,009
states I'm very often there and canna

594
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,200
and I'm in North America in general and

595
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,660
you have all those big names and I will

596
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,730
not mention but stock listed who are

597
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,590
doing crazy losses in revenue and the

598
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,799
more losses they make the more valuation

599
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:02,869
they get which is like for me for us in

600
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,240
Switzerland quite unusual so we are like

601
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:07,729
oh let's go let's go and do an IPO in

602
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,930
the North American market like this that

603
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,049
sounds like a good plan

604
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:14,810
and they are all coming here we oh I

605
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:17,659
mean all of our company we saw most of

606
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:20,000
the big names and some few acquisition

607
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,550
have been made but it's a different

608
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,369
mentality here's our is is our playing

609
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:26,569
ground here Europe we know it well when

610
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:29,750
you take a country like

611
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:32,960
was 350 cheese and were able to cut the

612
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,339
head of their King like couple of times

613
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,048
ago you need to understand it's not that

614
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:38,240
easy and for us the same it's not that

615
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:40,759
easy when we coming States so of course

616
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,409
Jean venture partnership between some

617
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:45,620
North American group and European group

618
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:47,509
is is important and I would say in

619
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:50,178
Europe at the moment I would say not

620
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:53,058
there is a crown in cannabis but like

621
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,370
when you see the 3 5 biggest company in

622
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:57,888
States is not what we have this at the

623
00:26:55,369 --> 00:27:00,138
moment in Europe so there is still the

624
00:26:57,888 --> 00:27:03,709
big position they like say 3 tops is

625
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:06,378
still open and this is on us to see to

626
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,028
have the right vision and and and some

627
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:10,609
kind of some company to partner together

628
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:13,339
in order to see how we can securitize

629
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:15,769
our market how is it yesterday I read

stable state named in Italy what is your

714

opinion about the Apocrypha of the

715
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:30,850
separation between medical cannabis and

716
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:33,980
hemp especially when we discuss about

717
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:37,579
flowers containing low THC like better

718
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:40,730
light in Italy de facto the there is a

719
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:44,240
mono poem about better light for low THC

720
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,549
content that is therapeutic and all the

721
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:52,339
other are only recreational this is an

722
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:56,269
epoch recei what I think first yeah okay

723
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:58,730
sorry I would say to call it medical

724
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:00,170
cannabis or cannabis or hemp or cannabis

725
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,059
or it is only names it's more than

726
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,800
marketing because at the end of the same

727
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,839
plan is the same but let's talk more

728
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,440
about the generic I mean what are the

729
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:13,579
terpenes what are the CBD levels of THC

730
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:16,340
different cannabinoids so I would say in

731
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:19,279
Italy I mean there are still selling

732
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:24,049
pouches like or whatever like buds for

733
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:27,819
decorative subjects because you can yeah

734
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:30,440
that's that's and that's in in fact

735
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:33,710
expose a bit the situation in Europe

736
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,830
like the countries is like they still

737
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,019
want them they don't want to stop it

738
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,909
because it will make a big problem and

739
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:42,470
I'm sorry but the black market exists

740
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,060
for many years I mean now we are talking

741
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,640
there all these conferences and nice

742
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:48,919
people and shoes and beam and founds and

743
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,020
bank and everybody's looking at it but I

744
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,940
mean the cannabis haven't stopped never

745
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:55,970
I mean it's it's a huge market they just

746
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:58,220
try government is trying to see how they

747
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,559
can set this up in order to benefit on

748
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,779
the tax side and the players are trying

749
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,450
to see how they can move in order to

750
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:06,839
bring the product to the retail so legal

751
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,580
wise and everything does the reason

752
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,919
why they are looking about doing some

753
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:14,699
operation in Greece or there or Jamaica

754
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,560

755
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,350

756
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,690
where to be dealt well to build the LPS

757
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:25,919
well where to bring this kind of product

758
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:28,170
or tincture or buds and and that's

759
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,529
that's at the moment the situation I

760
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,110
