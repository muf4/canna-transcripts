alcoholic drinks uh and cannabis at y

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,960
International uh as um I wanted to also

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,959
clarify earlier that the alcohol

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,559
industry is not actually against

26
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,839
cannabis in any way um I you can take my

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
word on that uh most of them are looking

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,240
at it as a great opportunity rather than

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,799
something to stop I think there's a bit

30
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,879
of paranoia in the Cannabis industry

31
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:22,159
about that um and with that out of the

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,319
way uh I would like my esteemed friends

discussion thank

92
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:54,280
you and the reason I wanted to ask them

93
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,119
these questions in the beginning and

94
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,719
introduce themselves as we were having

95
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,878
the conversation early in the green as

96
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,239
well it was a realization that the

97
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,280
stories all the great stories that these

98
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,120
guys have to share are essentially um a

99
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,598
glimpse or or a snapshot of The

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,920
Narrative of this transition that we're

101
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,359
talking about from the Legacy markets

102
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,199
into the fully branded legal Market of

103
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,319
the future so I would like to start with

104
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:22,079
asking everyone the question of how what

105
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,800
is the role of stigma um that already in

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,360
the previous panels we kind of heard

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,720
already that even in legal markets even

108
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,360
in Canada after seven years of

109
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,560
legalization this is still not gone how

110
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,759
do you see that um evolving or changing

111
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,160
over time in Canada or North American

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
markets that you are much more familiar

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,639
with or potentially even in Germany what

114
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,879
is your prediction about moving away

115
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,759
from this kind of cannabis bad you know

116
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,478
the the the the the the um Devil's

117
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,160
lettus kind of approach that still uh

118
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:53,879
haunts some segments of society yeah uh

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,240
I'd love to go first if don't be Minds

120
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,680
uh I've been really fortunate to be an

121
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,000
ambassador of uh culinary cannabis all

122
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,639
over the world and uh the idea the

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,639
Cannabis somal was really to take the

124
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,800
parallel of wine a multiple

125
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,199
thousand-year-old industry and show

126
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,759
people that cannabis was really a uh

127
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,400
very similar product from the people the

128
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,120
places even the structure you know the

129
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,038
triome head being a glandular head and a

130
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,959
circle same with a grape one you light

131
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,399
on fire uh one you have to ferment and

132
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,478
when you deal with those intoxicating

133
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,239
values and you have that same discussion

134
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,918
but back at the dinner table it's a

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,240
really great way to start pushing that

136
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,639
stigma obviously uh there's a huge uh

137
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,160
debate between combustible cannabis and

138
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,079
reduce risk or like a vaporized product

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,319
uh that's why we focus on making those

140
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:42,318
2.0 those vaporized products you know

141
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,919
with less smell with less um uh

142
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,360
Interruption to somebody's life it's a

143
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,120
really easy way to break down that

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,759
stigma uh have medical value and an

145
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,519
intoxicating value however you want it

146
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
and uh yeah like Marcus said civil civil

147
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,879
disobedience is the best way to break

148
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,879
stigma so I'll let him talk about that

149
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm sure absolutely yeah no I mean

150
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,478
stigma is a tough one um it it came over

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,840
a hundred-year period of propaganda that

152
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,918
was like influenced massively by

153
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,598
Hollywood who of course is exporting

154
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,279
their stories all around the world if

155
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:15,199
you look back you know 30 to 40 years

156
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,000
ago and you look how cannabis was

157
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,080
portrayed in any TV show in any movie it

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,918
was always the brain dead Stoner it was

159
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,959
always the like hey hey what do you mean

160
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,359
man it was always this really negative

161
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,560
stereotype and what they always did was

162
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,560
they always honed in on the most magical

163
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,319
medicinal benefits of cannabis and then

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,720
turn them into stereotypes and

165
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,080
negativity so uh oh if I'm uh eating

166
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,160
AIDS medication and I'm dying of wasting

167
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,240
syndrome I can use cannabis to increase

168
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,080
my appetite oh that's called the

169
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,478
munchies ha haa and they it's sort of

170
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,918
belittling so it took a hundred years of

171
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:54,079
massive propaganda to make cannabis as

172
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,318
as illegal as it as it was and and the

173
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,918
stigma to be as strong as it was I don't

174
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
think it's going to take nearly as long

175
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,799
because we pass information so much

176
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,918
quicker today but in Germany in

177
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,840
particular you know Germans are very

178
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,318
staunch that there's a lot of Germans

179
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,239
that are like it's a legal I'm not

180
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,199
touching it I think it'll take some of

181
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,519
those people a little bit longer before

182
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,360
I mean listen all you have to do is get

183
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,439
a little bit older and realize how much

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,319
it can take away your pain and reduce

185
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,759
inflammation and then it doesn't matter

186
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,439
what you believed at one point in your

187
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,400
life you're sold and you're taking it

188
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,879
for the rest of your life

189
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:30,519
so Tyler H your opinions about the

190
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,280
destigmatization um the s stigma is real

191
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:36,478
I think on the um getting you know from

192
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,559
the plant stigma to the business stigma

193
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,680
uh it's important

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,598
to I guess with with seven Lees in MTG

195
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,079
we we come almost go over the top to be

196
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,319
as efficient uh as a business as

197
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,680
possible to make every phone call back

198
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,879
to never be late to never show up to a

199
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,959
meeting with red eyes cuz then you get

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,560
the the jokes you know immediately come

201
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,719
it's like oh they're 5 minutes later

202
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,158
they're probably in the parking lot

203
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,759
token you know and and really trying to

204
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:10,120
combat it um to combat the stigma

205
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,319
constantly with uh with good business

206
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,280
practices um with with not having

207
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,080
advertising that that falls victim to uh

208
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,318
the Hollywood stuff that that he was

209
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,959
just speaking of um trying to keep it as

210
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,240
professional um as possible um because

211
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:29,038
yes now it is a billion dollar business

212
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,560
um and it needs to have uh still needs

213
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:35,038
to be hit and have that um that feel

214
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,038
that you get when you're high but also

215
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,360
having the professionalism to counter

216
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,240
the stigma and to um then have that be a

217
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,120
word of mouth Chain Reaction hey you

218
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,120
know what we did do a real estate estate

219
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,720
deal with these uh guys in the Cannabis

220
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,679
industry and it worked out great they

221
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,759
were very professional very smooth and

222
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,599
very understanding um and that just

223
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,240
slowly chisel away at that um very large

224
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,720
sculpture that is the stigma I want to

225
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,200
make a comment too the hardest

226
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,160
transition for for me especially as a

227
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,600
CEO has been uh gaining the Acumen and

228
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,319
professionalism of a CEO in a billion-

229
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,600
dollar industry you know I sold weed my

230
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
whole life um and so spending the last

231
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,680
10 years as an entrepreneur in this

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,240
business you know to pair with Tyler

233
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,879
said uh has been hard and to get that

234
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,879
level up and to present that to people

235
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,639
but I also still do like doing business

236
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,958
the most in a parking lot over a joint

237
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,720
with with weed guys anybody's got a

238
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,599
joint would you agree with that I agree

239
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
I actually agree with everything they

240
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,600
said you know just want to point one

241
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
thing out is in my experience uh in the

242
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,159
industry I've seen a lot of the stigmas

243
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,679
come I mean they're inevitable like if

244
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,000
you're going to be creating products

245
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,599
you're going to encounter some of these

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,839
things as you go through the process so

247
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
it really comes down to a battle of just

248
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,279
really up to all of us here in Germany

249
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,200
to make sure that we educate people as

250
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,200
much as we can through education is

251
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,959
where we're going to be able to break

252
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,920
these stigmas and show people that a lot

253
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,000
of them are false or just misinformation

254
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,519
being spread for whatever reason so yeah

255
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,799
I mean I agree with with everything

256
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,039
everyone said it's just making sure that

257
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,719
you share as much as education as

258
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:13,159
possible to not allow that overflow into

259
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,879
here um a lot of them are already kind

260
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,879
of proven wrong since we've done a lot

261
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,278
of research already in say the US and

262
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,039
Canada side so that with that uh believe

263
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,439
here in Germany shouldn't be too much of

264
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:27,759
a problem as long as education is

265
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,959
readily available for everyone mhm and

266
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,639
these are all great points I obviously

267
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,879
agree with everything that was said um

268
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:36,319
education is is is a core pillar of all

269
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,600
that so we starting that and we start

270
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,000
with your stories how that you

271
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,399
transition from the Legacy Market to the

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,720
legal Market the problems or the

273
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,159
learnings that you had in this process

274
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,000
um the whole kind of central point of

275
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,919
stigma in this conversation and the next

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,039
one for me the question that I would be

277
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,838
I think everyone would be interested to

278
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,879
hear about what is your take on the

279
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,760
German market and the legislation as it

280
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,439
appears to start being formulated right

281
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,838
now is it um do you see it as a positive

282
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,120
do do you get U are you optimistic about

283
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,000
the next stages of its Evolution what do

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,720
you expect to happen in the next 3 to 5

285
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,399
years in Germany uh when it comes for to

286
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,200
this transition we can start we start

287
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,159
with you we can take it all the way so

288
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,759
for me I see uh it's kind of like going

289
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,519
back in a time machine so it's in us I'm

290
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,919
from California in the US side we

291
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,320
started with prop 215 which was kind of

292
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,639
like semi-legal and I believe it's kind

293
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,760
of like what most governments are going

294
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,680
to do to to kind of test the waters and

295
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,439
get a feel for the market first so it's

296
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,519
going to happen kind of like the same

297
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,160
you know evolv throughout the process as

298
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,120
education comes along so I believe uh I

299
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,559
mean yeah I mean it's going to evolve

300
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,240
you know for the German Market it's

301
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,879
going to really blow up we we have a lot

302
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,919
of companies now that are established

303
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,919
the industry as a whole it's a lot more

304
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,559
mature there's a lot more equipment

305
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:00,039
available now so I believe it's a good

306
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,759
time for Germany to legalize and

307
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,399
introduce all these companies and

308
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:08,159
products into the

309
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,879
market um the policy any forward policy

310
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,838
is good policy never forget that

311
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,198
government never works quickly anybody

312
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,600
who's lobbed understands that anytime

313
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:17,958
somebody wants to parir it one of your

314
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,959
ideas especially when it goes all the

315
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:23,078
way to passing a legal bill for

316
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:26,198
legalization is a massive massive step

317
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:28,439
uh I'm a fanatic about critiquing

318
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,639
legalization in the roll out in

319
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,920
different states within Canada and I

320
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,720
have to constantly remind myself any

321
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,599
progress is good progress we can smoke

322
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,800
cannabis we can have the opportunity to

323
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,480
have regulated businesses and talk about

324
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,078
this in an open and normal and

325
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,680
professional format that's the big win

326
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,879
now as far as did you see do you see

327
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,000
that in Germany as well is it it's been

328
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,480
awesome like I got here I smoked a cigar

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,159
in the lounge and the guy was like you

330
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,440
can smoke a joint if you want I was like

331
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,919
wow this is fantastic but on the plane

332
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,199
the woman behind me as I mentioned I was

333
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,719
going to a cannabis uh conference said

334
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,399
oh no you shouldn't shouldn't mention

335
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,959
that so loud and I thought you know it's

336
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,759
so interesting to see the

337
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,278
destigmatization and uh I think the

338
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,039
reality of what's going to happen in

339
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,278
Germany because the social club roll out

340
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,679
maybe won't be the best model that's

341
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,240
probably where the bottlenecks about to

342
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,799
exist in your new uh framework there'll

343
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,159
be lots of weed there'll be lots of

344
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,359
extracts it'll be really hard to

345
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,799
actually pertain it and I think the

346
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,399
medical system is the one where you're

347
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,838
going to see a lot more traction just

348
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,120
like in the early 2010s in Canada uh

349
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,839
with doctors signing different

350
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,720
prescriptions and having more of a mail

351
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,360
order

352
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,399
uh cannabis system uh that's kind of my

353
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,800
prediction but I I don't think uh we're

354
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,759
from Canada there's Canadians North

355
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,000
Americans California like we're in

356
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,278
Germany because of legalization that is

357
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,559
a huge

358
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,519
win and what's the banake well I mean I

359
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,159
also agree with Andrew in the sense that

360
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,078
any Forward Motion is is a win it takes

361
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,519
a long time to to move these things

362
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:56,399
forward but the the thing that I'm the

363
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:59,360
most happy about is the shift in power

364
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,958
where the German police will lose power

365
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,680
and the German people will gain power

366
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,838
when you allow cannabis to be legal the

367
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,838
smell of cannabis will no longer legally

368
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,800
be a reason for the police to be able to

369
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,880
search you they're not going to carry

370
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,439
scales around with them and weigh what

371
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,838
you have and it's just going to it makes

372
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
even though there's regulations and

373
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,800
rules those rules and regulations will

374
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,040
become looser and looser because the

375
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,919
minute they open Pandora's Box you can't

376
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:28,599
close it again

377
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,639
mhm I would I would agree you know the

378
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,000
progress is great um but I think that

379
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,919
can be learned from uh other other

380
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,759
countries other states like California

381
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:42,399
that have gone legal is um and this is

382
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,639
in regards to the whole EU I guess not

383
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,958
just Germany there are the the medical

384
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,720
market right now in the EU is about 230

385
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,919
million uh with expected growth to maybe

386
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,160
2 or three billion in the next few years

387
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,719
but the illicit market right now is 8 to

388
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,000
12 billion that's right now so

389
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,160
something going legal is great progress

390
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
but it doesn't wipe away the massive

391
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:11,679
Market that exists so it's really the

392
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,600
the key is finding a way to transition

393
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,198
that customer to the new legal market so

394
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,320
that you don't have uh you know

395
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,879
naysayers say look the legal Market

396
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,639
didn't work the illicit Market's you

397
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,679
know thriving and now we have two two

398
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,480
issues to handle uh and I I firmly

399
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:34,679
believe that that it's um it takes a few

400
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:38,278
things one uh basically comfort for that

401
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,559
person convenience trust and price

402
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,519
that's for the the customer that was you

403
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,758
know spending the 8 to 12 billion in the

404
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,639
elicit market now they need to have that

405
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,959
Comfort when they go into the store they

406
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,440
need to learn something they need to

407
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,039
feel good about the purchase they need

408
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,360
to have convenience this needs to be

409
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,519
easier than calling their their their

410
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,879
connection and they have to have trust

411
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,639
that the product is what it is what it

412
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,039
says what it was tested

413
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,560
and that the price is within reason of

414
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:08,919
what they were getting you know so uh in

415
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,919
California we had a huge Market already

416
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,679
and then rolled this over now we have

417
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,000
40% tax people are like hey you know

418
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,278
I'll just get it from my friend that

419
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,919
grows in their backyard and then you

420
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,000
have the big investment that took place

421
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,759
can't pay back the Investments the

422
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,198
illicit markets thriving so then the the

423
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,000
legal markets basically subsidizing

424
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,439
themselves with the elicit market so do

425
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,159
you think if you had transitioned The

426
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,040
Operators as as opposed to trying to

427
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,519
transition the co uh customers you would

428
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,198
have had more success as The Operators

429
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,919
are already you know fulfilling their

430
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,599
market share with California they that

431
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,159
was the problem they TR we had we

432
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,120
already had the operators and we had

433
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,919
four times as many operators as we had

434
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,120
retail outlets and we still have that so

435
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:54,318
California's producing about five times

436
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,720
more product every day than is sold that

437
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:57,240
same baldl neck's going to happen here

438
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,079
because of the clubs yeah and that's

439
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,959
where I really think in in Germany and

440
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,438
the EU in general it's making sure that

441
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,240
there's enough convenience retail

442
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,319
outlets uh Social Clubs what whatever

443
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,318
the licensing process is is making sure

444
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,639
that there's enough of those per

445
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,720
demographic per municipality and that

446
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,480
the country or the

447
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,078
the the the country's government has the

448
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,279
control in California the local

449
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,639
municipalities Trump the the state um

450
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,000
licensing so you have different local

451
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,038
municipalities that just said no we

452
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,558
don't want it and which is something now

453
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,279
we took away the convenience we already

454
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,000
heard about the Bavarian um fear uh

455
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,879
earlier in a couple of panels and it's

456
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,679
in the

457
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,000
conversations and I would take this this

458
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,600
couple of mention that you guys made

459
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,359
already and ask you the next questions

460
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:53,879
would be what are your major fears when

461
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,798
it comes to the the potential downfalls

462
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,360
for for the the I wouldn't even call

463
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,158
legalization the decriminalization

464
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,479
process in Germany at the moment what

465
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,240
what what what are the things that

466
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,640
really you know uh you think could go

467
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,279
really wrong for example for me the um

468
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,840
the the abstract nature of some of the

469
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,079
legislation when it comes to the Social

470
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,439
Clubs the limitations um the fact that a

471
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,678
lot of the wheed that will be produced

472
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
there will not be of the quality that

473
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,960
you mentioned the questions about how

474
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,360
they actually make a profit because they

475
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,919
have to make a profit somehow um and

476
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,319
essentially forcing them to use sideways

477
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,799
streets to to actually make that profit

478
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,480
the the limits when it comes to 100 met

479
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,240
from schoolyard

480
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,200
um all of these kind of issues um are

481
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,839
major alarm bells in my head about how

482
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,038
that can be derailed and also of course

483
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,918
in my mind politics is something that

484
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:43,359
hasn't really been discussed in my mind

485
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,038
according to the latest information we

486
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,439
have the the the the governing Coalition

487
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,519
most likely will lose power in the next

488
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,919
election which is not very far away what

489
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,839
would happen with the next government

490
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,600
would they continue down that path or

491
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,359
could they potentially use the

492
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:59,399
shortcomings of this law to actually

493
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,079
postpone any any other meaningful change

494
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,600
down the line so these are the kind of

495
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,879
questions in my mind what what would be

496
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,119
the things that kind of um worry you

497
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,640
most about about the the changes now if

498
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:13,239
there are any um we can start again here

499
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,759
so for me like in the US when I look

500
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,159
over there we have a lot of issues with

501
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,279
just the government you know like

502
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,600
they're setting a really high tax or

503
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,639
they just put rules that are not really

504
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,279
like they don't make sense for us as

505
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,919
producers you know it makes it almost

506
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,599
impossible for us so that's really like

507
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,559
the biggest fear

508
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,918
just that whoever's in charge of making

509
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,279
the laws and regulations that they don't

510
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,960
make them uneducated you know like make

511
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,519
them just throwing things out there cuz

512
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,840
that's a lot of the things that happen

513
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,599
it's uh we all notice coming from the

514
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,558
processing side that whoever's making

515
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,319
these laws is lacking some education in

516
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,359
the how the things are made so if we

517
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,439
were able to maybe establish a

518
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,479
connection there to help these uh

519
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,440
lawmakers make better decisions I think

520
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,400
that can be avoided cuz that's mainly

521
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,200
the biggest problem like uh he was

522
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,840
saying that we have a black market

523
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,640
that's thriving in California and it's

524
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,720
because of that because the laws make it

525
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,200
really hard for the legal Market to

526
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,759
thrive you know and compete with the

527
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,000
black market who doesn't have any of

528
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,000
these

529
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,038
restrictions um I think laws are very

530
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,038
hard to reverse they're also very hard

531
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:25,038
to enact uh there was a lot of people

532
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,038
who are now very passionate and have put

533
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,119
their bet in on legalization I don't

534
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:31,480
think you need to worry about a new

535
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,639
party coming in and changing everything

536
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,360
I think uh what you may see is actually

537
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,480
a more uh a better approach where they

538
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,279
see some pieces of the system broken and

539
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,960
affect quicker and more accurate change

540
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,119
uh over the last 5 years of legalization

541
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,120
in Canada we've had quite poorly written

542
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,678
policy put a lot of handcuffs on

543
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,038
movement specifically like I make

544
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,400
extraction products we call that

545
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,119
legalization 2.0 in Canada because they

546
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,038
had to write it into the law 3 years

547
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,119
later that's a massive failure that's

548
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,720
now 27% of market share it's always

549
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:02,199
outpacing and combustibles it's a very

550
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,640
uh important part that should be

551
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,919
introduced right away um so I would say

552
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,120
no I wouldn't worry at all about uh my

553
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,640
government talking but if anyone you

554
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,199
know I'm hope this is a room full of

555
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,320
activists like I was like Marcus was um

556
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,880
you need to talk to your local

557
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,839
government whoever is your person in

558
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,480
local government Municipal provincial

559
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,918
state federal whatever it is you need to

560
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,240
actively have conversations with those

561
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,880
people they all have an email on their

562
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,359
website they all have an assistant they

563
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,840
all run for your vote we all live in

564
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,439
democracies that's how this law was

565
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,199
passed in the first place having that

566
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,159
open and honest conversation about your

567
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,120
consumption your family's consumption

568
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,760
your business is what these people take

569
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,558
to their job at work every day and talk

570
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,960
about those people that they represent

571
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,119
so the most important thing you can do

572
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,440
is continue that conversation and that's

573
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,158
how these laws don't get reversed I

574
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,240
think it only up from here I think

575
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,720
Germany's actually really set a standard

576
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,200
in the center of the EU um with how

577
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,720
strict it is here this was a huge uh you

578
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
know not a surprise to me because the

579
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,440
Rumblings have been going on for a long

580
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,840
time there's been a lot of amazing

581
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,120
medical activists here that uh you know

582
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:07,158
the plant and medicine is what gets you

583
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,639
to legalization and never forget that as

584
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,880
we all look at the opportunity of it

585
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,120
this is a medicine and people fought for

586
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,400
that um so keep fighting for that and

587
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,759
whatever that helps you with do it so

588
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,798
don't look backwards only forwards yeah

589
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,919
I mean I would suggest that people don't

590
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,720
stop with their Civil Disobedience

591
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,440
because Germany didn't just wake up

592
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,240
yesterday or a couple weeks ago and

593
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,679
decide that they were going to legalize

594
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,558
cannabis like people fought tooth and

595
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,640
nail for that and took that to get it

596
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,278
and we did the same thing in Canada so

597
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,120
they won't get it right right away but

598
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:42,480
it is Forward Motion thinking and um the

599
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,038
things that bother you what happened in

600
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
Canada for the most part which was

601
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,158
unfortunate was that when people got

602
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,440
their licenses that suddenly they were

603
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,000
like oh my God I have a license to grow

604
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,400
cannabis to process cannabis to sell

605
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,759
these different products like it was

606
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,360
such a crazy feeling that all the

607
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,278
activists immediately stopped with all

608
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,599
of their activism because they were like

609
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:03,880
well I got to protect my license like

610
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,519
this license is worth millions of

611
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,679
dollars I can sell weed and so that

612
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:11,359
unfortunate aspect will probably happen

613
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,480
here as well so I do speak to the true

614
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,278
activists in the crowd you need to

615
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,960
maintain your Civil Disobedience because

616
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:22,119
none of this was given to us uh we had

617
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,120
to we had to take

618
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
it well

619
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:33,558
said I I would agree with with what what

620
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:36,720
they all said um I don't know the uh the

621
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:39,000
the German legislation or the law that

622
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:45,440
well what I do know is what's happening

623
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,599
in the US uh is now we have 26 different

624
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,600
legal cannabis laws because we have

625
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:55,359
States and it's uh cannabis is a States

626
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:57,519
um issue so there's 26 states in the US

627
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,479
where legal adult use cannabis can take

628
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,200
place and

629
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,679
every one of those is different I mean

630
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,798
some of drastically different uh who can

631
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,400
own the licenses how many licenses there

632
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:12,079
are how many licens there's not so what

633
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,640
could be learned is um having

634
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:19,079
consistencies in the legislation um and

635
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,038
and just you know taking from us as an

636
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:25,079
example uh if the federal government

637
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:27,398
legalizes cannabis it is going to be a

638
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:31,678
major mess because we're we already have

639
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:36,398
26 ways of doing it and how are those 26

640
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,840
ways GNA mold into this new oneway or

641
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:42,398
things like that so staying consistent

642
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:44,480
and being very patient with the um the

643
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,599
process because at the end of the day

644
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,798
it's a great win it was legalized enjoy

645
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:54,519
the win and just kind of roll with the

646
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,960
punches and Beyond the punches and and

647
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,000
and the and the the activism and

648
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,240
everything that we have to continue

649
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,319
doing as you all said and I fully agree

650
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,759
with with um in terms of more

651
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,278
practicalities um you are all veterans

652
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,398
of the scene for a very long time and

653
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:09,558
you've been there from the beginning

654
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:13,918
until the Branded future uh what changes

655
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:16,599
in the terms of format um of products or

656
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,759
occasions or the way people consume it

657
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,359
have you witnessed over the last decade

658
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,919
or two uh I mean for example the

659
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,759
transition away from combustibles that

660
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,000
was already mentioned the rise of um

661
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,119
concentrates the potential for Edibles

662
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,839
or beverages have you seen specific

663
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:32,918
things that potentially could also be of

664
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,240
relevance to everyone in the audience

665
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,080
today giving them a glimpse of the

666
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,038
future of cannabis once it finds its way

667
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:43,918
legally you can start the other way now

668
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:46,759
just I'll talk on that um we we

669
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,480
primarily now we're a flower brand um

670
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,200
that's our our bread and butter indoor

671
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,919
flour uh three four years ago in

672
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,840
California the extracts and the pins uh

673
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,720
went game Busters had the best growth

674
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:03,918
and that stalled out and now still to

675
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,558
this day 65% of sales in in California

676
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:11,000
are flour and the other fastest growing

677
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:14,558
Market is pre-rolls rolled up flower so

678
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,519
uh we then kind of came back to stain

679
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,639
with flour and it's it just seems that

680
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,720
yes there's all kinds of wonderful new

681
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,759
options and I definitely agree on the

682
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,839
medical side that the extracts is 100%

683
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,960
the way to go but it just the data and

684
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,480
the s

685
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,960
just keep showing that combustible flow

686
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,960
is is not going anywhere at least in in

687
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
California yeah no I would completely

688
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,640
agree I will say from my perspective of

689
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,000
really sort of pioneering water has back

690
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,440
in the very early days that I you know I

691
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,319
I was around a time where you saw some

692
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,120
dry sift you saw some pressed hash from

693
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:53,200
Lebanon and Morocco and Afghanistan and

694
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:55,158
and Nepal but you just didn't see like

695
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,440
the quality that suddenly came to be

696
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,360
when water extraction came onto the

697
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,519
market and so that sort of opened up the

698
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,439
the the gates it's taken a long time I

699
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,918
mean it took a very long time to see it

700
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,640
grow and change they we're still a small

701
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:13,000
percentage like there's no doubt that

702
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,640
that flower is is king um but in reality

703
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,960
regardless of what it is you're always

704
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:23,480
smoking or vaporizing or using the hash

705
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,038
so the modality of what it is is is is

706
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,919
fine with me I mean I think the

707
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:31,919
future who who can say what will happen

708
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,559
I also agree um with Tyler that flour is

709
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,840
not going anywhere um but extracts will

710
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,960
continue to grow and so will Edibles and

711
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,480
Beverages and it we'll just have to

712
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,519
hopefully be here to see it play

713
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,360
out love it uh well my company makes

714
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:51,038
future weed future hash ewed any way I

715
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,879
can describe it to people um like Marcus

716
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,278
said the modality doesn't matter I want

717
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,799
you to be able to consume it I keep

718
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:58,440
talking about uh combustible flour

719
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,679
versus reduced risk this is is just

720
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,360
paring tobacco vernacular to be very

721
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,080
honest with you um these products for me

722
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,119
break down stigma it's very easy for me

723
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:10,678
to sit on stage smoke this pen wasn't

724
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,599
intrusive on anybody in the audience you

725
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,640
could barely smell it uh this to me is

726
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,278
what the future of these products are

727
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,960
because you can travel around the world

728
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,359
with them you can have them in your

729
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,480
pocket very easily you know in Canada we

730
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,158
see soccer moms enjoying this instead of

731
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,360
a glass of chardonnay now um there's a

732
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,240
lot of progress to cannabis and and you

733
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:32,558
know uh thanks to Marcus for uh doing

734
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,679
everything with bubble bags the first

735
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,839
time I ever made hash I was 16 years old

736
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,480
I watched a George cantes video and I

737
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,839
had a 5 gallon bucket and I made some

738
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,319
pretty bad hash and I've gotten better

739
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,839
at it over the years cuz there are some

740
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,359
tricks but like you know we're smoking

741
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,439
future weed right now this is an

742
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:51,158
electronic dab rig with amazing uh

743
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,200
concentrates that were extracted using

744
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,760
really cool machines engineered in

745
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,519
Canada that are you know using different

746
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,319
pressures and different temperatures to

747
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,000
take some of the best parts of the

748
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,000
cannabis plant and flowers going nowhere

749
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,599
I still love smoking joints every day

750
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,200
but I can't smoke a joint in here and so

751
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,719
I want every option and I'm just here to

752
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,120
deliver those options around the world

753
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,079
so that's the future for

754
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,719
me yep I agree with what everyone said

755
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:18,558
here I mean uh touching on the point

756
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,319
there I want to highlight like uh one of

757
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,918
the experiences I had was seeing that

758
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,519
for example where the industry is kind

759
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,278
of stalling out we have the same

760
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,399
products all across the board now and

761
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,359
there's really much new things going on

762
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,479
so in order for you to push that

763
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,918
boundary forward and create more like

764
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,319
future products you want to think

765
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,240
outside the box and look at everything

766
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,759
as like it's all about wax all day you

767
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,919
know you don't you got to just be

768
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:48,319
obsessed with it so for me an example

769
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,120
was one time I remember I was with my

770
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,079
girlfriend and we went into the makeup

771
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:54,959
store she wanted to buy some makeup and

772
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,519
while I was looking at the stuff there I

773
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,079
noticed the consistency was very similar

774
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,679
to the extract already and then they

775
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,439
just clicked on me I'm like I can

776
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,320
probably use any of these containers

777
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,240
here to create a whole new product that

778
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:10,519
would be a new way to consume so what I

779
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,519
did is I took a lip gloss container an

780
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,319
empty one I put oil in there and it

781
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,599
worked perfectly to twist a bottom and

782
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,158
push the oil out to infuse joints so

783
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:21,519
from there I came out with a product

784
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,080
called blunt brush so just thinking like

785
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,720
that outside the box to where like

786
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:26,759
everything in your everyday life you got

787
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,640
to compare it and see can I create a

788
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,640
similar product to it because after all

789
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,240
it's it's still just a plant you know

790
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,720
there's a lot of plants in the world

791
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,120
that we all use to create different

792
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,519
products so we got to just stop thinking

793
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,759
that it's something different it's

794
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,038
really similar and we can apply it to a

795
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:46,319
lot of the current uh Market that's uh

796
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:48,398
that are out there and create similar

797
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,240
products I think we covered most of the

798
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,639
key kind of points um when it comes to

799
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,240
this kind of transition that we talk

800
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,759
about um I have another personal one

801
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
because also of my background in the

802
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,759
alcohol industry and realizing a long

803
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,240
time ago the importance of social

804
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,079
consumption in alcohol H and social

805
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,359
consumption in alcohol was also what

806
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,119
broke the stigma back in the prohibition

807
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:12,439
years and the essential element of

808
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,879
Beverage as a totemic uh Central Point

809
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,919
in the ritual of socialization so my

810
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,360
question for you would be how do you see

811
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,159
cannabis playing in that field I know

812
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,638
that in North America over the last

813
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,639
couple of years uh the first social

814
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:27,918
consumption lounges or on trade

815
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,479
establishments or whatever we call them

816
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,720
started appearing do you see more of

817
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,599
that do you see it as an essential part

818
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,399
of this transition as well social

819
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,000
consumption not just you know not just

820
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:40,359
smoking joints or dubs at home with

821
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,119
friends but actually places that

822
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,599
facilitate exactly that that could be

823
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,599
part of this

824
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:50,918
narrative I could I could talk about it

825
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,038
uh so in Vegas right now there's there's

826
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,519
the the new club and then there's

827
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,599
another club that they just opened and

828
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,599
they found that people love the Cannabis

829
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:02,199
drink so it's like going to a bar but

830
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:03,759
you get the 2% THC the 5% THC mocktail

831
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,720
and you chop it up like that but there's

832
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,278
also smoking lounges San Francisco is

833
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,960
full of them the rules are tricky

834
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,679
everywhere like in Arizona um you can't

835
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,960
buy any cannabis at the social Lounge

836
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:15,919
but you're allowed to sit there and you

837
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,278
can rent a bong and they have exotic

838
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,000
overpriced snacks uh that you can enjoy

839
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:22,278
because you got to pay for it somehow

840
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,759
but they used to have one in Vancouver

841
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,880
too where it was like 10 bucks for an

842
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,519
hour 20 bucks for the day still there

843
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,080
listen I opened mine in Vancouver in

844
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,200
2003 right I had the melting point which

845
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,519
was a vaporization bar and I I'd love to

846
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,600
be able to speak on this because the

847
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,038
importance of us needing to gather and

848
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:45,079
consume together not as friends but as

849
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:46,359
public and strangers is is so important

850
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,240
that's how you make friends and I've

851
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:51,278
spoken to this in the past that when

852
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,359
alcohol went to pubs and the the working

853
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,480
labor people would go and enjoy the

854
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,158
beers those conversations that they had

855
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,759
would shape that these are the people

856
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,120
that are building the world their

857
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,919
conversations would shape the world and

858
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,918
next came the tea houses and now these

859
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,440
were intellectuals drinking teas and the

860
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:08,799
conversations they were having in those

861
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,880
tea houses would shape the world and

862
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,599
then came coffee and people are all

863
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,000
overproductive and drinking their coffee

864
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,079
and having conversations that are

865
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,319
shaping the world it's our turn to shape

866
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,119
the world we're going to shape the world

867
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,720
of

868
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,839
snacks and and new ways to kick back and

869
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,278
we drinks and we drinks yeah fancy uh we

870
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,759
have maybe 3 or 4 minutes left um do you

871
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,440
want to do some questions do people have

872
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:33,158
a question one person has a question two

873
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,080
people have a question all right we'll

874
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,240
start here and then we'll go to there

875
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,839
and then that'll be it fantastic thank

876
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,839
you let's hear it for the panel by the

877
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,840
way hi hi nice to have you all here my

878
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,359
question would be do you do you see

879
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,918
where is the reason why German

880
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,278
government want to play now this

881
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,440
regulation about the extracts in the for

882
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,960
example in farines that it should be

883
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,200
solventless should be just old school

884
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,759
hashish and maybe some hot press but you

885
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,639
know no diamonds no no crazy solance and

886
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,079
do you do you see where's the reason for

887
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,960
that do you see those new extracts

888
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,399
coming they are more dangerous they

889
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,320
could be you know maybe nobody knows

890
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,440
what is those extracts you bringing from

891
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,399
USA some crazy diamonds with the sources

892
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,639
and you know like [ __ ] like that we want

893
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,719
to see you know natural flower real

894
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,960
hashes you know when I was last time in

895
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,838
Chicago a few months ago I was trying to

896
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,398
buy some dirty hashes like we smoke here

897
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,239
in Europe you know like just like black

898
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:37,719
ofan or something they were like what

899
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,479
the f is this we don't even have this

900
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,638
you know so yeah they just need to be

901
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,760
educated we make real hash we make very

902
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,358
safe products we run thousands and

903
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,560
thousands and thousands of dollars of

904
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:51,319
lab tests uh to say that the products we

905
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,199
make aren't safe uh is just a

906
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,119
miseducation understandably that there

907
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,000
are other products that can be

908
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,160
solventless Marcus definitely prefers a

909
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,199
solventless product

910
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,000
where I'm a solvent producer we both

911
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,679
share a lane and there's a lane for

912
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,079
every specific product and product type

913
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,559
and it's important to meet everybody's

914
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,720
demand I would also say a lot of that

915
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,078
has to do with the Optics too right if

916
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,838
you're smoking a little hash joint you

917
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,680
roll it with a nin of to back or

918
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,960
whatever that's cool but when you see a

919
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,000
bunch of guys with their giant Rigs and

920
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,280
their fat torches and they're sitting

921
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,480
around zonked out of their minds it

922
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,560
looks really more like you're doing

923
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,079
drugs than it looks like it's definitely

924
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:27,400
a part of the stigma about it and and

925
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,920
I'm not saying that it's a bad thing I'm

926
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,760
saying is the Optics of it another part

927
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,358
of those Optics and that stigma is that

928
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,000
there are of course companies that could

929
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,039
come in like Andrews and make completely

930
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,159
Safe products but if you ever look up

931
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,440
like people dying from hash it's cuz

932
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,759
they blew up in their house doing it at

933
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,480
home the incorrect way and they created

934
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:53,640
a negative stigma on the product yeah

935
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,039
yep um if Germany's going to catch up to

936
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,400
North America and

937
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,599
this sorry if Germany's going to catch

938
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,400
up to to North America um what are some

939
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,039
modernization what are some policies

940
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,400
that we should be selling to our mlas or

941
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:09,279
our government Representatives

942
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,318
access yeah access the social club is

943
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,640
the bottleneck here you got to access

944
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:16,639
the customer the patient what have

945
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,280
you we have time for one more question

946
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,679
uh there's a microphone right over money

947
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,920
will help The Growers unfortunately

948
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:29,000
there you go up there do you see it is

949
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,599
that a microphone the transition it just

950
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,480
has to happen one more question here we

951
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,200
go greetings uh I just wanted to sayate

952
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,318
that uh I'm an owner of an laboratory

953
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:42,159
analysis lab and I can confirm that

954
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:43,960
solventless extracts can uh match any

955
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:48,960
extracts done with

956
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:52,000
a solvent so uh depending on the quality

957
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,960
and the technique uh applied it's

958
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,280
actually all the same so well wait until

959
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,199
they find out that all of the tpine are

960
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,079
hydrocarbons in the solventless hash so

961
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,159
solventless is a misnomer at best and

962
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,960
then what are they going to do when they

963
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:08,399
figure that out when they're like oh

964
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,440
we're not allowing solvents it's like

965
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,680
really well dmon is a solvent and it's

966
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,119
in my weed I think I think I think one I

967
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:15,598
think to for everyone to understand here

968
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,358
is that it was mentioned in the previous

969
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,640
panel that it's not a pharmaceutical

970
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,440
conversation it's a political

971
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,000
conversation so many of these decisions

972
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,159
are not based on actual pharmaceutical

973
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,119
data because the product is the same but

974
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:30,239
it it's on Optics political Optics so

975
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,318
looking tough on drugs or uh the fact

976
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,959
that many of these products have a THC

977
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:37,279
content of 80% so it sounds high and

978
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,639
let's not allow people to do this kind

979
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,960
of things so I think we have to separate

980
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,078
politics from pharmaceutical background

981
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,159
or or reality in that sense yeah it's

982
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,440
always the Optics hey we're out of time

983
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,779
