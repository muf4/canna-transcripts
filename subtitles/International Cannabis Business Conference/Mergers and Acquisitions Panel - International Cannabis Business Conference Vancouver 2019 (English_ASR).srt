1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:12,250
it's the M&amp;A panel and we've got we're

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,638
talk fill of industry heavy

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,980
for you here I will give you a quick

4
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:21,219
introduction and actually take it out to

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,740
all these folks that'll take a minute or

6
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:26,439
two to tell them or to tell you guys

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:30,969
about themselves and their companies so

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:34,929
we've got Paul Brockman I'm sorry

9
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:36,878
Patrick Brockman yes the other one so

10
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:40,238
we've got Patrick Brockman who's the

11
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:42,070
executive chairman of passions Patrick

12
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,500
you want to say a couple words about

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,859
yourself here and what you guys do over

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,799
at passion Pasha is I think Canada's

15
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:53,049
first prohibition-era brand house where

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,500
our approach to the market was to gather

17
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:58,808
the legacy growers the brands that were

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,210
on the shelves of dispensaries prior to

19
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:03,759
legalization at the same time we took

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,579
advantage of the new regulations with

21
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,069
Health Canada to allow for a micro

22
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:13,659
cultivator or a craft grower to get in

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:16,688
the regulated economy so we bought a an

24
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:19,450
LP and instead of growing flour were

25
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:21,579
entering into supply agreements to

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,618
purchase that flour from craft growers

27
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:26,379
across the country so we're the largest

28
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:28,359
craft brand housed at the same time

29
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:31,089
we're aggregating all of that production

30
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:34,390
that is currently supplying 90 percent

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,380
you know of Canadians needs so that's my

32
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,599
latest a year ago I was part of a

33
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:43,328
company called doja cannabis I was a

34
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,489
founding director and we got really

35
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:48,219
lucky it was a lifestyle brand and I

36
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:50,469
smoked my first joint in grade 7 and

37
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:52,719
I've loved cannabis I've made money with

38
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,640
it and they'd love with cannabis and

39
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,099
it's been a really great experience and

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,868
so canopy came knocking and gave the

41
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,328
shareholders a you know a huge win and

42
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:04,599
so that's kind of my latest thing I love

43
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:07,899
cannabis and I love the culture that

44
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:10,810
created this industry and I've taken an

45
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:14,259
approach that is focused on that

46
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,349
community and helping them transition so

47
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:19,899
that they can really take back that

48
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:22,129
industry that was stolen from them so

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,379
that's me

50
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:29,310
thanks Patrick and then we've got Bobby

51
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:31,289
cause Hayley from hard assets Inc I am

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,120
come out of the real estate in the fine

53
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:36,629
art worlds I started investing in

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,210
cannabis five years ago mmm with my son

55
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,599
it was at that time cultivating about

56
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,400
5000 feet he now has licenses in LA and

57
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,400
we've made investments around the world

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,830
in what I call an ecosystem so the

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,580
underpinnings are technology science

60
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,810
innovation and I'm very interested in

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,530
women and their companies and their

62
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,000
products and often invest in them

63
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,330
one of the women she's interested in is

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,689
our own Jamie Pearson as CEO of Bank

65
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:10,950
Corporation hi i'm jamie pearson the CEO

66
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:14,340
of Bank Corporation bang is a publicly

67
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,869
traded global house of brands we started

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,840
with our award-winning chocolate bar

69
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,150
developed by a master chocolatier and

70
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,610
have since evolved into over 100 SKUs we

71
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,000
are currently distributed in nine US

72
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,769
states and nine foreign countries our

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,689
Canadian partner it was on the previous

74
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,209
panel Neil within diva and they've got a

75
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:38,509
booth next door there so go check them

76
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:41,310
out bang is really has a global vision

77
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:44,189
for where cannabis can be and we're

78
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,550
executing that vision strategically and

79
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:51,180
M&amp;A is a huge part of of that process I

80
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,610
am the daughter of a cultivator he's

81
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,510
been cultivating 55 years I'm a

82
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,970
second-generation cannabis person but I

83
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:02,759
made my way in business in real estate

84
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:06,120
and finance much like Bobby I was a real

85
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,819
estate investor for 25 years doing those

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,189
deals going to get money for deals was

87
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,859
came easy to me I have real estate

88
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:16,709
investments in three countries so I've

89
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,169
learned how to navigate rules depending

90
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,620
on you know where we are the culture the

91
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:24,000
finance rules governmental rules so

92
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,250
deals were coming across my desk in the

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,620
real estate space that had to do with

94
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,300
cannabis and obviously having a dad in

95
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,449
cannabis

96
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,460
and you know being a business person in

97
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,050
the cannabis space I started seeing

98
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,758
these deals come across my desk and

99
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,210
realize there was an opportunity for me

100
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,069
to get into cannabis directly and saw it

101
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,589
for the opportunity that it is it's it's

102
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:47,658
going to be the next big global thing

103
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:49,519
and we are all there or pre-prohibition

104
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:49,908
but we can't put the genie back in the

105
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,948
bottle

106
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:54,168
people are getting addicted to those tax

107
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:56,319
dollars and starting to see what

108
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:59,029
cannabis can do not only for

109
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,718
governmental organizations with funding

110
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:04,758
but also we're seeing opioid addiction

111
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:06,319
rates go down and domestic violence go

112
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,819
down and we're starting to see the real

113
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,800
benefits of this magical plant and also

114
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,289
the benefits in the environmental era

115
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,228
that we can start assuring in if we're

116
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:20,899
going to be responsible so a little bit

117
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:22,370
about my story a little bit about bang

118
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,888
I'm excited to be here

119
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,468
and I'll turn it over to you so then

120
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:30,918
we've got Paul Paul Peterson CEO

121
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:32,509
co-founder of next leaf Paul so I've

122
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,269
been in the industry for about six years

123
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,830
now I was initially at working for

124
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,930
peace' naturals we were the first

125
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:41,508
producer in Canada worked with the

126
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,870
founders to sell the company to Kronos

127
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:48,408
group and started next leaf it our focus

128
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,050
was to acquire and develop extraction

129
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:52,819
technology that we felt would lower the

130
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,860
cost per milligram when you're looking

131
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:58,098
at CBD and THC as ingredients and

132
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,900

148
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,970
we've licensed our technology to Aurora

149
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,370

companies but calm which is a delivery

151
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:50,810
and online retailer so I'm also I'm an

152
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:51,769
investor an entrepreneur sort of all of

153
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,600
the above

154
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:56,620
just to give you guys a little bit of

155
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,580
context and sort of jumping right in

156
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:04,100
we've we've got two investors here or

157
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:08,060
operator investors that are based in the

158
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:10,610
US and myself that makes three then

159
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:17,439
we've got a couple Canadians right so

160
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:21,439
first question is how does the structure

161
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:24,228
meaning if you're private or public how

162
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:28,418
does that affect M&amp;A activity from the

163
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:33,620
standpoint of each of these companies so

164
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:37,728
kick it out to Patrick first how do you

165
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,470
look at based on how that company is

166
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:43,240
structured and where they are how does

167
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:47,330
that affect sort of your view of them

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:50,329
structure from my perspective is is you

169
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:52,399
know looking at management and you know

170
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:54,379
what what kind of control this

171
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,918
management have and how much you know

172
00:07:54,379 --> 00:08:00,709
that management group has invested and

173
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,978
then outside shareholders is key you

174
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:06,439
know for longevity I think those are

175
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:09,199
probably the two most important I don't

176
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,899
know that you know issued an outstanding

177
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,500
you know really is is that relevant but

178
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:18,319
that's my take structure interesting as

179
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,288
a I'm an investor without a fund this

180
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,259
time so it's just my own money so I tend

181
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:26,329
to look very carefully at management and

182
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:29,000
I tend to usually want to work closely

183
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,649
with that management on expanding their

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,939
opportunities sometimes it's helping

185
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,610
raise some or cap

186
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:37,759
more often now it's cross-pollinating

187
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,469
but I've just hit a little interesting

188
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,269
thing that I'm going to speak about even

189
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,070
though it's quite private I've been

190
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:45,259
invited on the board of a public company

191
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,899
so some of the companies that I've

192
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:51,350
invested in I've brought to management

193
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:55,250
and we're negotiating very tightly for

194
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,339
some of those companies so when we talk

195
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,190
about structure I don't have a deal

196
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:03,560
structure to bring these investments to

197
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,839
the company and I'm now thinking and

198
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:10,219
wondering and I'd love any counsel for

199
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,500
many of you is what do I charge for my

200
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,920
services since I haven't gone on the

201
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:18,769
board yet and I'm acting in fact as an

202
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,289
investor broker to bring a company a

203
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,838
whole company into the mix of a public

204
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:28,789
company so I'd love counsel on that I

205
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:31,579
don't have an answer this week Jamie so

206
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:34,578
bang went public on through an RTO on

207
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:36,500
the CSC in July before that obviously we

208
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:39,559
were privately held company and our I

209
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,429
think our pre public life was very much

210
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:45,649
developing our strategic plan once we

211
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:47,929
went through that going public process

212
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,669
which was very painful and if any of you

213
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:53,899
are planning to do that please come talk

214
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:56,629
to me but seriously I learned a lot from

215
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,389
that process and it took it took a lot

216
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,700
of a lot of people a lot of lawyers and

217
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:05,750
a lot of paperwork that you know in

218
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:08,209
retrospect caused us to put a strategic

219
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,559
plan together that's that's very focused

220
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:14,809
and now our M&amp;A look is focused on where

221
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,259
are those margin and revenue a creative

222
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:20,659
opportunities where the fit is perfect

223
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:23,480
for what we need to grow bigger so we're

224
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:25,120
we're not only looking to grow our top

225
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,110
line and our bottom line revenue and

226
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,610
we're looking to grow our distribution

227
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,379
reach and we're looking to grow our

228
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,970
brand recognition reach and we're

229
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,120
looking for companies that aren't

230
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,509
looking for somebody I get a lot of this

231
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,100
oh I have this great idea and basically

232
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,299
what they're saying is I developed a

233
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,909
great product I need

234
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:46,279
and I need you to run my business for me

235
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,750
because I have a great idea in cannabis

236
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,309
but I don't know how to run a business I

237
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,769
don't know how to do marketing I don't

238
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:53,449
know how to you know get distribution

239
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,429
and they basically want to bring me

240
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,740
their great idea and help me help me

241
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:59,149
make them successful we're looking for

242
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,399
the same thing we're looking for

243
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,740
companies that have a value add for bang

244
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,039
that fill some of the gaps that we have

245
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:10,159
so that these these acquisitions are

246
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,009
strategic and fit well with what bang

247
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,959
has going on we've been a CPG company

248
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:17,179
since day one we have been putting

249
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,519
consumer packaged goods in the hands of

250
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,889
consumers around the world for 10 years

251
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,559
so we're very clear about what we need

252
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,330
and what what lanes were going into we

253
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,519
just acquired a beverage company called

254
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,110
red ace organics if any of you read that

255
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,139
press release we're excited about that

256
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,480
because it's professional athletes it's

257
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,970
Olympic athletes that are using these

258
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,940
products because they are you know the

259
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,310
new buzzword is app to genetic

260
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:46,490
functional beverages Redis has been

261
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:48,199
selling these products in in you know

262
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:52,310
the large chain distribution centers

263
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,550
like Whole Foods sprouts Amazon for

264
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:57,109
years and has this massive following of

265
00:11:55,549 --> 00:12:00,289
athletes that are using these products

266
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,480
because they work so we saw that as a an

267
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:05,629
a creative acquisition for bang because

268
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,629
it fit some holes that we had in our

269
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:10,730
distribution plan and so that's what

270
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,100
we're looking for prior to going public

271
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,600
we just looked at every deal as we were

272
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,220
kind of figuring out who we wanted to be

273
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,889
now we're clear about who we are and

274
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,259
we're going after it so I guess that

275
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,449
just to clarify and then we'll we'll

276
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,950
take it out to Paul and actually maybe

277
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,530
back to Patrick after that but I'm

278
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:31,850
talking about do you as a public entity

279
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:33,949
look at pub COEs or private companies

280
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,110
more favorably when you're looking at

281
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:40,940
M&amp;A activity so does that actually

282
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:44,120
impact your decision-making yeah I mean

283
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,660
on the willingness of management in a

284
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,090
private company to engage with you so

285
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:52,339
but I think effectively yeah you didn't

286
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:57,139
want to target something private you do

287
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:58,639
yeah Jamie I am a big believer that you

288
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:01,220
just look for the win-win opportunity

289
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,689
and where there's a meeting of minds

290
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,019
where you've got management that's

291
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:09,440
really in sync with goals and aligned

292
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,759
with I think the philosophy we're not

293
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,410
looking for a money grab and we're not

294
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,330
out there just trying to gain top-line

295
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:15,620
revenue we're out there really looking

296
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,930
for like I said those are creative

297
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,610
acquisitions that make sense for us and

298
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:21,979
if they're private or they're public I'm

299
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,940
gonna take a look at them and your deals

300
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,129
for stock or cash or both depending in

301
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,410
real estate you know it you every deal

302
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:33,019
is its own animal and you got to figure

303
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,870
out what works for both people so what

304
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,449
I'm hearing is essentially it's

305
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,269
irrespective of the wraparound it's it's

306
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,520
about what they're doing and the team so

307
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,980
Paul do you agree though a publicly

308
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,449
traded company merging or acquiring

309
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,100
another publicly traded company we're

310
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:54,890
investing in or that gets very notated

311
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,680
yeah Paul you want to chime in I'm just

312
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,419
gonna say you know for for structure we

313
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,519
always say that you know there's a lot

314
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:03,709
of froth out in the market today if you

315
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,019
look at you know valuation or market cap

316
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,210
versus of a publicly traded company

317
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,620
versus a private there's not a lot of

318
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,360
fundamentals that make sense right now

319
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,299
there's a company with a 900 million

320
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,100
dollar market cap that did $20,000 in

321
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:19,909
cannabis revenue the first six months of

322
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:24,740
2019 right won't mention the name but

323
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:26,449
you know I think I think what what we've

324
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,799
seen in this industry is that is that

325
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,990
there's a lot of companies that have

326
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,659
been structured to be publicly traded

327
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,549
companies that the full retail investors

328
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:36,049
the end of the day this bubble is going

329
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:38,889
to pop in the sense that a bubble of

330
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:42,588
creates created when you can finance a

331
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:44,120
company on storytelling but the good

332
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:45,950
thing is I think we're getting to a

333
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,870
place where were you know having

334
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,759
fundamentals to driving your business

335
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,889
and being able to put out a product that

336
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,569
that consumers want at a price that you

337
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,970
guys can make money at is something that

338
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,680
it

339
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,810
is going to make sense when we look at

340
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,359
acquisitions we look at we look at

341
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,708
privately you know private companies we

342
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,810
look at technology that's come out of

343
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,549
the the legacy market in BC I think

344
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:08,000
we've been very successful in working

345
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:10,979
with operators and and entrepreneurs

346
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,839
that maybe have needed help to to

347
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,399
commercialize their their technology and

348
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,930
I think this is the thing that we love

349
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,509
about British Columbia is that there's

350
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:21,239
some some great operators and some very

351
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:23,100
experienced cannabis people in this

352
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,560
province that we're really having fun

353
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,360
and and for us we've been focused on

354
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,088
intellectual property so not just

355
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,068
acquiring technology but filing patents

356
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:35,310
around us and with the all Trias and the

357
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:36,899
consolation brands of the world we think

358
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:39,328
that intellectual property really allows

359
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,870
the small guys to to force the bigger

360
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:45,688
guys to play nice agreed and so Paul you

361
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,560
make a great point that right now there

362
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:51,568
is sort of a flight to quality we

363
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:55,669
started to see that sort of away from

364
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:57,208
these sort of bombastic like just really

365
00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:00,539
headline-grabbing

366
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:04,739
sort of optical business models and

367
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:10,159
really really inflated valuations based

368
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:14,188
on top-line revenue are you guys seeing

369
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:18,708
right now are you guys seeing sort of a

370
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:22,188
in focus with your companies more for

371
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:27,568
sort of profitability gauging engaging

372
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:30,539
potential M&amp;A targets by their evide and

373
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:32,789
not top-line I think there's gonna be

374
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,948
really two at least we've seen some

375
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:38,159
acquisitions in the last 12 months but

376
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:41,058
going forward I think that still many of

377
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,870
the big five for example or overpriced

378
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:44,429
overvalued and they're still going to

379
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,039
need to fill in their back in their

380
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:49,739
balance sheet backfill it with new

381
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,360
assets that can support that valuation I

382
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,389
think that you're still gonna you know

383
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,579
see that happening they're gonna have to

384
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,278
justify that but yeah I mean everyone's

385
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:01,378
skating towards revenue and you know

386
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,019
with a limited market that Canada

387
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,909
presents you know really the only choice

388
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,529
if you're capitalized and structured

389
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:10,470
well is to be looking at

390
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:12,720
USS assets that are cash flowing they're

391
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,789
legitimate and just look at the you know

392
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,069
there were two acquisitions today you

393
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:19,409
know big so they're happening but

394
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,169
they're all US assets right now because

395
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,450
that market is under regulated relative

396
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,940
to Canada so it makes for a safe haven

397
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,799
for capital so you've seen the you know

398
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,930
if anyone's here looking for money I'm

399
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,059
sure there are you know in the in the

400
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,460
Canadian market there's just been a you

401
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,839
know a giant sucking sound and it's you

402
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,509
know the sound of money

403
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,789
you know headed south and as it's that's

404
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:44,789
where they want to be because regulators

405
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:47,039
are off our backs and people can

406
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:49,920
function you know much better relative

407
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,009
to the Canadian markets well so under

408
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,700
regulated relative to the Canadian

409
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:59,009
market still very regulated but I think

410
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,990
at the end of the day look it's the

411
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:02,730
consumer market it's a very mature

412
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,920
consumer market and there are companies

413
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:08,640
making hundreds of millions of dollars

414
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,140
off of like in actual revenue running

415
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
their businesses yeah I mean look I

416
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,160
don't eat like the California market is

417
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,920
roughly the same population as Canada

418
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,350
there's you know six or seven thousands

419
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,710
lysed and licensed entities in

420
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:24,719
California now and they you know they do

421
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,350
it quickly we've got like what two or

422
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,329
three hundred you know got retail you

423
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:32,730
know the numbers from retailing it's

424
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:36,089
like we represent thirteen percent of

425
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,279
the population in in Canada Alberta

426
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:40,980
right across the border they're like I

427
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:44,670
think like four percent they've got half

428
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,039
the number of licensed retail outlets

429
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,600
for the whole country because the

430
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,759
government is off

431
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,409
you know entrepreneurs backs so it's

432
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,900
more successful and there's more

433
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,060
cannabis being sold in in Alberta who

434
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,880
would have thunk right but that's the

435
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:02,549
relationship between efficiency capital

436
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,220
and the markets is where government is

437
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:08,009
not intrusive you see progress being

438
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:12,000
made and people being able to you know

439
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:14,809
create healthy safe products you know

440
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,200
that don't have a lot of garbage

441
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:21,119
packaging on that people want so your

442
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,380
question essentially if

443
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,009
restate it and correct me if I'm wrong

444
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,980
is putting it in banks perspective is

445
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:30,990
bang making different decisions now

446
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,460
because there's pressure on the for us

447
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,920
to be looking for bottom line revenue as

448
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,630
opposed to doing these you know

449
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,490
willy-nilly acquisitions looking for

450
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:42,480
top-line revenue top line aesthetics yes

451
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:45,720
I think from from bank's perspective we

452
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,740
put together a really strong executive

453
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,808
management team we're all shareholders

454
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,539
so the duty that we have to shareholders

455
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:56,369
is a duty we have to ourselves we are

456
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,759
all very interested in bang being very

457
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:01,379
successful so when you come at that

458
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,150
question of are we looking at bottom

459
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,130
line revenue yes we want to improve our

460
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,840
cogs we want to improve our top-line

461
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,130
revenue we want it to filter down so

462
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,839
that all of us are making more money

463
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,940
that isn't just because we have a

464
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,589
responsibility at the end of the day to

465
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,259
people you know there's a lot of people

466
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:18,000
trying to do these quick turn

467
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:20,490
investments and there's a big short game

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,200
when you are in a small cap stock that

469
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,730
you're watching because you know you

470
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,860
make this great announcement your stock

471
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,990
goes up and then people sell and because

472
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:30,178
you don't have that much volume trading

473
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,759
that one sale can affect your stock

474
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,070
price it's a very tenuous game that

475
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,200
we're in but we just keep saying I tell

476
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:39,450
everybody that works for me don't look

477
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,980
at the stock price make good decisions

478
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,150
because at the end of the day if you're

479
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,660
running a good business and you're

480
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:48,720
making good decisions the stock market

481
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,269
becomes a weighing machine as opposed to

482
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,460
a you know that short-term you know

483
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:55,440
market has spoken and I want I want our

484
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,880
company to be heavy at the end I want us

485
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,279
to be you know the biggest baddest

486
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,679
company we can be but that's banks

487
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,480
perspective and I know it's unusual but

488
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,690
to answer your question out in the

489
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,460
marketplace yes I'm seeing a shift I'm

490
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,500
seeing these big companies and the

491
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,130
smaller you know mid mid cap stock

492
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,109
companies are no longer just playing an

493
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,010
M&amp;A game they're not they're not gaming

494
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,229
it anymore

495
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,789
we're starting to see a push for bottom

496
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,980
line revenue which I think will benefit

497
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,889
the industry you know all the way

498
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,769
through it's a sign a maturity I think

499
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,740
we're at another stage also we went

500
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:32,759
through a big investment cycle and we

501
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,980
sort of set

502
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,440
the standards in the industry what I'm

503
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,059
seeing now is my investments are

504
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,299
maturing there are opportunities for

505
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:44,879
them to grow and partner with others or

506
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:46,740
whatever but now I'm starting to look at

507
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,870
the Israeli scene I'm investing in a

508
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,390
number of laboratories I have a honey

509
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:53,639
product that will take a long time but

510
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,770
will come to market so I think that

511
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,410
there's another shift that's going on we

512
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:00,990
saw the run up of the Canadians of come

513
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:04,380
becoming public the stock market but now

514
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:06,539
for the investor crowd like me I think

515
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,340
we want to see what's new and how do we

516
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,589
integrate it and what we have and where

517
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,179
we think the market is going the market

518
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:13,919
is absolutely going to be a consumer

519
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:18,269
market but we're also producing

520
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,279
high-quality low-cost products for seven

521
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:22,289
billion people in this world and I think

522
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,460
we as an industry have this

523
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:29,190
responsibility to take care of everyone

524
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:32,069
not just the luxury market not just the

525
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:37,049
craft market this is an international

526
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:39,299
product when one more I think point on

527
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,970
that is that we're having conversations

528
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:44,159
internally on the executive team that

529
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,529
there are a lot of really good brands

530
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,180
out there that are making excellent

531
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:50,759
products that aren't going to make it

532
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,580
they're under capitalized or they

533
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,589
they're in a state where something the

534
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,929
moons aren't lining up for them and so

535
00:22:55,589 --> 00:23:01,289
we're also watching those brands very

536
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:03,600
closely because we know that they're

537
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:06,629
going to be opportunities for us to you

538
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:09,119
know come in and not contrary to what I

539
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,610
said before where I want brand I want to

540
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,519
do M&amp;A activity that's a that's actually

541
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:16,859
beneficial to bang or plugs a hole or is

542
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,259
a natural fit but we're also looking to

543
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:20,459
and seeing really smart people with

544
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,049
really good brands that aren't going to

545
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,910
make it we're you know we've got our eye

546
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:26,069
on them too and I think that's another

547
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,800
shift in what's happening in the in the

548
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:30,899
investment space yes and I think that in

549
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,149
these investments that I'm making it's

550
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,610
sometimes not just the product but it's

551
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,980
the talent the talent and the passion

552
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:41,669
and their ability to pivot so you bring

553
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,529
in that IP to the company to my company

554
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,910
and it can be utilized in other products

555
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:48,910
and services well synergizing across

556
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:51,910
of all your entrepreneurs absolutely so

557
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:54,700
let's take it out to sort of a different

558
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:58,800
facet of of how the industry is growing

559
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:02,519
let's talk about different products in

560
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:06,240
verticals that right now you guys see as

561
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:10,359
sort of the fastest growing the commerce

562
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,769
what verticals suppositions specific

563
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:16,449
sectors in the space we hear a lot about

564
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:19,180
beverages and that's been obviously

565
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,309
something that's been out there happy to

566
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,320
start with Paul on this one you have

567
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,690
something for us but yeah you know what

568
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,639
for us we've really looked at

569
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,259
intellectual property as being an area

570
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,770
that I think there's gonna be a lot more

571
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:34,690
focus on in Canada at least it's all

572
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:37,509
been about growing plants because the

573
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,100
2.0 products haven't been legal when we

574
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,440
look at other industries biotech life

575
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:44,079
sciences Pharma intellectual property

576
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,330
tends to play a big role in in M&amp;A

577
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,369
activity but also in shareholder value

578
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:50,049
and I think for us we've said from day

579
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,849
one let's not reinvent the wheel let's

580
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:53,440
go out there and acquire intellectual

581
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:55,480
property from guys that have built it in

582
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,610
an unregulated marketplace and let's

583
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,440
let's further develop it let's scale

584
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,119
that with it with our engineers and and

585
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,450
and file intellectual property around

586
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,729
there we see all these downstream

587
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,370
formats that lead to more mass-market

588
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,930
appeal being what I think a lot of

589
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:12,579
companies are gonna be really focused on

590
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:15,700
whether that's through acquisition or

591
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:16,990
developing those in-house and even your

592
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,880
example with the joint roller that

593
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,589
you've license to Aurora I think it's

594
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,940
these new formats that maybe companies

595
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,289
don't have that expertise or they don't

596
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,759
have that technology in-house that

597
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:27,059
they're gonna go to another market

598
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,769
whether it's the US or elsewhere and

599
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:33,190
look at licensing or acquiring it and I

600
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:36,160
think the the new formats at least in

601
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,170
Canada are gonna really change I think

602
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,660
how cannabis is consumed but when you

603
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,060
think about where cannabis needs to go

604
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,320
today to it to where it needs to go

605
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:47,619
you know let's call it ten years from

606
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,529
now is is mass market appeal isn't gonna

607
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:52,059
be in in the the plant being smoked it's

608
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:54,490
gonna be in all the nonsmoker pools that

609
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:57,609
the baby boomers and sort of today's non

610
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,298
consumers get comfortable with consuming

611
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:03,488
throughout

612
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:06,459
so I absolutely agree and yes Paul

613
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:09,129
alluded to sort of our IP on the on the

614
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:11,830
pre-roll side and we actually use that

615
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:14,468
IP as a form of non-dilutive financing

616
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:17,228
when we licensed our tech and you know

617
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:21,489
got an eight-figure some back with the

618
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:25,899
royalty from Aurora so uh it's right now

619
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:28,598
I would very much agree me being a bit

620
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:32,518
tainted but IP is something that I see

621
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:37,178
is something that will differentiate

622
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:38,979
beyond what right now is on the market

623
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,690
which is which are essentially a lot of

624
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:43,269
commoditized solutions

625
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,940
everyone's selling the same things it's

626
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:48,848
just how do you do it a little better

627
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:51,429
Jamie your point we we always quote this

628
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:53,858
famous Henry Ford saying where he said

629
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:55,179
if if customers had asked me if I had

630
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:58,328
asked customers what they wanted they

631
00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:01,479
would have said a faster horse he

632
00:26:58,328 --> 00:27:04,388
invented the car obviously okay so we're

633
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:06,369
saying in that regard we customers don't

634
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:08,428
know what they want because they they

635
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:11,078
don't necessarily look at the

636
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:13,690
environment and think what's possible so

637
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:16,628
our job is to see what's possible and

638
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:21,359
those low barrier to entry delivery

639
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:24,478
systems are kind of a no-brainer the the

640
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:27,338
European American Canadian consumer

641
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:29,348
already alters their brain with beverage

642
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:32,678
they already used wine and beer and

643
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:34,538
alcohol to relax so we you know I try to

644
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,239
picture my mom out there with a dab rig

645
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:39,908
and a blowtorch and she's probably not

646
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:41,558
going to be dabbing and and neither am i

647
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,359
just so you know I did it once with my

648
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:48,459
dad it was not good and I'm not gonna

649
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:51,668
dab over again but but beverages I hope

650
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:53,379
yourself know to some yeah and if you

651
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,429
ever want to know just come ask me out

652
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:59,468
it's it's it was unpleasant but the

653
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:01,059
beverage side of things I think we can

654
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,619
all wrap our brain around and I think

655
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:05,319
the beverage companies are trying to

656
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:06,548
figure out how do I think in fact Bobby

657
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,979
you now we're talking about this in Palm

658
00:28:06,548 --> 00:28:10,690
Springs last week it was how do I go

659
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,190
drinking with my friends

660
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,528
and I want to have two or three

661
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,869
beverages and get high I don't want to

662
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:19,720
get drunk so how do I do that because I

663
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:22,329
like the way cannabis makes me feel and

664
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,489
I want to go have that social experience

665
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:27,249
and I think the companies that are

666
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:30,098
figuring out how to do what consumers

667
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:32,259
want and do it right probably with IP

668
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:34,808
when bang spent an IP company that's

669
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:36,759
what we how we've spreader our message

670
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:40,479
in our footprint is through licensing IP

671
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:43,419
the same way Wagner Dimas has we also we

672
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:45,580
see skin care you know beauty products

673
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:47,229
men's grooming we've got a couple of

674
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:49,569
female skin care line and a men's

675
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:51,038
grooming line coming out because that's

676
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:54,819
a low barrier to entry people are

677
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:56,288
already doing that and in dog treats and

678
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:58,239
things that they do with their pets if

679
00:28:56,288 --> 00:29:00,669
we can figure out a way to enhance

680
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:02,200
consumers lives in a way that's already

681
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,989
accessible and easy and that they

682
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,249
understand I think the most important

683
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:09,548
piece though is that the products have

684
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:11,440
to work and I think that's where to

685
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:14,829
Bobbi's point we have a responsibility

686
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,169
to be using good active ingredients and

687
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:19,269
the products need to be safe and it

688
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:21,909
can't just be lip service it has to be

689
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:24,128
what we're really doing I think the

690
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:26,470
other thing that I'm on a quest for is

691
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:30,098
to solve problems so for example I think

692
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:32,229
that osteoporosis is a gigantic problem

693
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:36,428
in the world when you think of people

694
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:38,649
over 50 and the disintegrates the diets

695
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,599
that we use and so forth and how it's

696
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:44,469
breaking down bones I'm looking at

697
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:47,079
endometriosis and other glaucoma other

698
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:49,538
issues that are international issues for

699
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:52,478
the population that we can solve with

700
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:55,808
cannabis so it's not just a consumer

701
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:57,788
game but it's also solving the problems

702
00:29:55,808 --> 00:30:02,579
that we all face in some way with a

703
00:29:57,788 --> 00:30:05,190
female plant very truthful

704
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:07,439
Patrick Science and Technology have

705
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,799
agree with everything that's been said

706
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,220
I'm most excited I'm a flower guy but I

707
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:17,730
recognized in the beverage category that

708
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:21,150
I if you can create a new up takes you

709
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:23,970
know technology so that you're getting

710
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,890
high you know in three minutes and you

711
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,839
can continue in by Bing

712
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,640
you know without getting you know higher

713
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,069
but I think that means that the beverage

714
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,890
has to have a rich cannabinoid enriched

715
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:36,929
terpene recipe and because that's what I

716
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,080
want in the cannabis experience I don't

717
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:41,610
want just a THC so that's technology and

718
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,439
I think that's you know one of the

719
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:45,599
really exciting things I really think

720
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,100
that we're in the infancy of an industry

721
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,990
if you want to you know you use a

722
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,899
metaphor as a ball game I think we're in

723
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,700
the third inning and it's just starting

724
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,380
there's so many incredible things that

725
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,390
are gonna happen and you know we look at

726
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,250
the euphoria that's been in the cannabis

727
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:02,220
market over the last couple of years but

728
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:05,369
you know that's that you know at the end

729
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,660
of the day there's still millions of

730
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:09,719
people that are gonna be you know

731
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:12,570
consuming cannabis so that markets not

732
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,029
changing we're just looking at the stock

733
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:18,629
market and all of that the underlying

734
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:21,539
market is people and products that you

735
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:24,240
know provide a meaningful resolution to

736
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,670
you know health issues I mean at the end

737
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,980
of the day this is like a beautiful part

738
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:31,950
of mother nature and this is a gift and

739
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,220
so it's our obligation to share that

740
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,860
gift you know in our individual way

741
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,250
whether it's technology and you know

742
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:45,349
brands and products so yeah that's how I

743
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:48,960
see it agreed and so actually that's

744
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:50,579
when we start to take talking about how

745
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,430
we convey this message and how we

746
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:55,789
educate inform so a big part of that are

747
00:31:53,430 --> 00:32:00,390
sort of mass communications channels and

748
00:31:55,789 --> 00:32:02,639
that in the u.s. is challenging and in

749
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,810
some ways in Canada is even more

750
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:11,820
challenging right the restrictions on

751
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:13,039
marketing advertising I guess

752
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,740
I'd love to

753
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,099
a quick some quick input on on how that

754
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:22,519
sort of fractures the entire playbook

755
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:25,129
here the restrictions on messaging right

756
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,170
now in our industry relative to most

757
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,170
anyone can say anything in their space

758
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:32,779
we can't this is probably one of the

759
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:35,630
most negative parts of the cannabis Act

760
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:38,509
and the regulations in Canada it's just

761
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,570
it's a huge blow to the industry and you

762
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:44,089
know as as businesspeople were artists

763
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:47,000
we're creating you know something that

764
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:49,069
we have for the rest of the world and

765
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,950
then you've got this body that's saying

766
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,750
no no no you can't say that you know

767
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,580
look at this wrapping that they're

768
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,920
making you put on this theme it's the

769
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:59,809
worst thing in the world yet they're

770
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,850
making this you know these are the laws

771
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:04,190
but it's not what we would you know we

772
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:06,199
would choose if it was us making the

773
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,480
regulations it's because it's them

774
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,289
making the regulations you know an ex

775
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,480
police chief you know like he was the

776
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:16,460
guy that was appointed to you know head

777
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,160
up the you know the discovery of

778
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,529
regulations and you as a prohibitionist

779
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,440
so what else are you gonna get so it's

780
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:26,240
just you know in a decade the people

781
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,430
setting up on the panel you know at the

782
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,500
next ICBC in Vancouver in ten years

783
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,029
we'll be talking about the old days when

784
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,819
it was crazy but it's gonna get better

785
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:36,799
it's just gonna take a long time here's

786
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:39,259
what I would say about you know branding

787
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,389
and obviously it's it's very restrictive

788
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:43,009
in Canada on what you can you can put on

789
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,200
your packaging but the reality is that

790
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:46,670
the best weed that's ever been sold in

791
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,269
this province is coming from a clear

792
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:53,360
plastic baggie and the reality is that

793
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:55,730
product quality sells itself a I think

794
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,589
actually the the regs disproportionately

795
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,539
affect the big producers the guys that

796
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:01,220
have found a way to work around you know

797
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:03,049
celebrity endorsements and they've got

798
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,890
the rapper's and and and everybody else

799
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:08,840
on their label but you know it's hard to

800
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,640
sell schwag when you can't do the same

801
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,620
type of marketing that that you know big

802
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,150
alcohol and big tobacco and big CPG

803
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,130
could do so it really comes down to

804
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:19,250
what's inside that packaging and I think

805
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:20,869
we've seen some you know craft producers

806
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,250
small LPS that have that have done

807
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:24,909
exceptionally well over the last five

808
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,798
years and I think we're very excited to

809
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:29,200
see you know companies that can put out

810
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:31,659
a great flower and now soon in a few

811
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,388
months a great 2.0 product that that

812
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:36,039
will get consumers to gravitate but it

813
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,139
is going to absolutely be very difficult

814
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:39,639
to build a brand I think you're gonna

815
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,858
see a lot of brands actually get created

816
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,628
in the u.s. to get brought to Canada not

817
00:34:41,858 --> 00:34:47,940
that dissimilar from other from other

818
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:51,219
from other things yep that question

819
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:54,760
brings me back to Palm Springs last week

820
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:57,578
where I just will tell you I'm so

821
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,079
grateful to be in this industry and you

822
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:00,940
know five years ago six years ago

823
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,740
whatever it was when I got into it I was

824
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,530
I was nervous about it I'd come out of a

825
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:08,259
really conservative spot and bottom line

826
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:11,619
is I saw the future in Palm Springs and

827
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,750
it it blew my mind and if you have a

828
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:18,990
chance you need to look up the knocks

829
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:20,108
doctors see it's a family of doctors

830
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:25,269
Jessica

831
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:26,588
Rachel and Janice Knox there and there's

832
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:27,900
two more doctors but the three women

833
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:31,858
were there was a women's conference

834
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,670
there endocannabinoids one of them was a

835
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:35,679
anesthesiologist the other one was a

836
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,230
Integrative Medicine they're all three

837
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,960
physicians there's five five Knox

838
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,789
physicians in this family they are

839
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,548
figuring out they all went back and

840
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:49,028
figured out that the endocannabinoid

841
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:50,980
system has receptors in the heart and in

842
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:52,599
the brain we all know this but we all

843
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:57,608
know that we don't know what we don't

844
00:35:52,599 --> 00:36:00,130
know yet and the future of CPG the Knox

845
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:02,108
doctors are gonna bring us there because

846
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,789
what's gonna happen is we're gonna start

847
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:06,219
to understand oh I have infertility

848
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:08,950
problems or I have Crohn's disease or

849
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:11,588
something autoimmune and there is some

850
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:13,449
endocannabinoid reason that because we

851
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:15,730
don't have access to this research that

852
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:17,679
they're going to be able to say oh keep

853
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:19,900
your cb1 receptor needs to get this

854
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,250
endocannabinoid or this terpene but

855
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,680
you're trying to get pregnant so let's

856
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,329
make sure we're not doing this to you we

857
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,848
don't have access to that level of

858
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:31,150
research yet but it's coming and I

859
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:34,080
these women are superstars go check them

860
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:36,150
out because they are going to lead the

861
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,360
decisions in this nation to figure that

862
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:41,160
out and that's what's coming right now

863
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,720
we're talking about marketing and what

864
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,750
we can and can't do with marketing

865
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,149
I think it's information that's going to

866
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,219
drive consumers that's going to drive

867
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,230
marketing right absolutely and we're not

868
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:55,319
just talking about logos it's to be able

869
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:58,070
to compel folks to understand what's in

870
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:01,470
this product and having hands tied is

871
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:03,809
brutal it's it's unlike any other

872
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,849
vertical and I'll say beyond sort of

873
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:08,820
that high level messaging you know

874
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:12,779
you're also talking about being blocked

875
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:16,050
off essentially not have access to two

876
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,860
massive platforms social media Google

877
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:21,539
who everyone's got access to but us and

878
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,360
that's a massive problem for us in the

879
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:26,190
US as well so we're it's not necessarily

880
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,620
you know regulation or health

881
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,900
disclaimers we get that as well health

882
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,299
claims we all have people that say I

883
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,889
can't sleep without cannabis but we

884
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,080
can't make health claims about our

885
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:39,900
products but we know people are using it

886
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,150
for anxiety pain relief all of these

887
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,130
things we can't talk about it so we

888
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,700
can't give consumers good information

889
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,200
about dosing and usage and health

890
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,750
benefits because we can't talk about it

891
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,519
we can't have access to platforms so I

892
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:56,610
just want us to think bigger as an

893
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:59,340
organization well as an industry really

894
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:02,309
it comes down to giving these folks just

895
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:05,130
the opportunity to choose this sort of

896
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:06,779
natural product versus you know other

897
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,430
solutions that are being pumped by other

898
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,640
industries that's what we don't have the

899
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:14,039
right to do right now in my opinion to

900
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:16,049
the degree that we should anyway we're

901
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,699
talking about Canada and the US but I

902
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:20,820
think we need to look at this as a

903
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:22,710
global industry and a global set of

904
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,410
products that we're developing as brands

905
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,720
that will be used everywhere just

906
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:30,960
setting the stage but Bobby it's it's

907
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:32,339
all emanating from the US and Canada so

908
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,070
they're all gonna run into the same

909
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,430
issues when their market matures to that

910
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:41,730
level so if we execute on this and start

911
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:44,219
to solve it in the US and Canada those

912
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,019
solutions and will emanate out I think

913
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:49,209
when they adopt I look at it in two

914
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:52,750
right now and currently and for the

915
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:56,710
foreseeable future entrepreneurs are

916
00:38:52,750 --> 00:39:01,809
going to be frustrated by regulations

917
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:04,119
and regulators in a decade many of the

918
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:07,750
regulations that are obstructing us will

919
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:10,358
be gone but the beautiful thing about it

920
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,818
is that and brother Marley taught us

921
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:15,789
this is that cannabis represents the

922
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:18,940
truth and that's why it's been you know

923
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:21,940
part of the Prohibition agenda to keep

924
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:24,369
you away and keep keep us away from that

925
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,650
which represents the truth they want to

926
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:29,769
segregate us so that we're actually not

927
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,559
seeing reality and seeing the truth and

928
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:35,380
so it's out and that's what's happening

929
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:38,079
now and it's saving lives it's changing

930
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,298
lives it's making people wealthier and

931
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,048
happier and getting them off that [ __ ]

932
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:46,239
that you know big farm is pushing on us

933
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:48,460
and is protected by you know through

934
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,679
regulations but it's just a matter of

935
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,690
time the truth is out I think if we've

936
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,489
quoted Bob we've got to end it at that

937
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,798
because I think it's it's not gonna go

938
00:39:54,489 --> 00:40:02,608
past that but I'll say this

939
00:39:56,798 --> 00:40:05,739
it is hard it's gonna get easier but

940
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:07,779
everyone's getting their legs now you

941
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:10,750
build your company when it's hard

942
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,980
because it is hard and you persevere and

943
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,318
you get it done and that's why you're

944
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,869
all in this room doing it when it's hard

945
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:20,920
and you guys will get the benefit of

946
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:23,068
that we all will with that said we've

947
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,809
got a couple more minutes and in Gayo

948
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:27,849

949
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:30,430

00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:05,058
my question is to Patrick so I know that

960
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:07,308
pasha Browns is very they really look at

961
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,920
the culture of cannabis where it's come

962
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:14,119
from the community how would you

963
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,329
encourage small retail business owners

964
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,880
that don't have ten years you know to

965
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:23,869
put money in to the business and wait

966
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:27,890
for the payoff great are you are you

967
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:30,048

tilray just paid seventy million dollars

978
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,028

not even just asking for myself I'm

986
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:22,489
asking for the community of small

987
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:24,710
business owners the the business

988
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:27,650
community that's represented the gray

989
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:29,929
market they're survivors they're smarter

990
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,519
than you know the the regulated group

991
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:33,679
because they've been having to dodge and

992
00:42:31,518 --> 00:42:35,179
weave for you know all this time and

993
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,969
they'll keep fighting yeah

994
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:40,699
don't like I mean I say my t-shirt stay

995

gray and keep the lights on and wait you

996
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:46,279
know wait let Health Canada and

997
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:49,099
regulators prove to you that they're

998
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,349
actually doing what they're supposed to

999
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:54,710
which is opening stores and letting

1000
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:57,440
people grow and you know just like you

1001
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,630
know go toe to toe we I mean all the

1002
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,088
change that's occurred in Canada is Kirk

1003
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:04,608
and John you know and the lawyers and

1004
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:06,108
Rob Lori's here as well like you know

1005
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:08,328
these are the people that have really

1006
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:10,608
made the effective changes but it's been

1007
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:12,680
the community funding it you know and

1008
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:14,299
and keeping it all alive that's why

1009
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:17,118
we're in the position we're in right now

1010
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:21,170
it's not because Harper and and Trudeau

1011
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,900
actually care see you you guys you guys

1012
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:26,030
are in a place where it's essentially

1013
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,309
it's what California has done and it's a

1014
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,470
massive regulated market now but it

1015
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:32,180
started you know you guys call it a gray

1016
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:33,769
market we didn't really have a name for

1017
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:37,460
it it was just what it was

1018
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:40,429
since you know 1996 when prop 215 came

1019
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:44,869
out the medical market and a lot of

1020
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:47,838
those survivors are now running some of

1021
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:53,690
the biggest compliant operators in the

1022
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:57,529
state so hang in there thanks for a

1023
00:43:53,690 --> 00:44:00,139
great panel I just wanted to ask all of

1024
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,670
you as you're considering brands that

1025
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:04,068
you're looking for one of the strangest

1026
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,858
parts of the shifting sands of Canadian

1027
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:08,480
commerce right now is the fact that the

1028
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:11,358
whole medical industry seems to have

1029
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,539
been swept under the rug or normally

1030
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:16,308
forgotten so I'm wondering in the u.s.

1031
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:18,710
especially where you have more states

1032
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:20,780
that are medical and recreational how

1033
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:23,568
many of you are looking for brands that

1034
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:30,010
have medical orientation versus

1035
00:44:23,568 --> 00:44:35,230
recreational I think that

1036
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:39,550
as states have in the US have opened up

1037
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:43,599
either regulated or fully legal that the

1038
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:45,400
recreational market is is both medical

1039
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,829
and recreational so if I'm buying a

1040
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,260
medical product and I'm in a legal state

1041
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:53,259
that sells recreational just by my

1042
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,119
product that way I believe and and I

1043
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:59,410
think that we haven't we don't have the

1044
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:01,900
same differential in medical and fully

1045
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:04,569
legal that we had a couple of years ago

1046
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,858
and so I think it's involved what I'm

1047
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,440
saying is I believe it's an evolving

1048
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:10,840
story and that yeah I don't think my

1049
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,440
medical brand in Canada if it's emerging

1050
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:17,950
as valuable in the United States you

1051
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,380
know it's gonna be legal federally so I

1052
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:22,929
do believe we need medical products as

1053
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:25,990
we were talking about so that that's a

1054
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:27,940
great point yes we need medical products

1055
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:31,389
we need to solve ailments and diseases

1056
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:33,880
and it's our responsibility as an

1057
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:36,029
industry to take this female plant and

1058
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,559
find that research and do it and

1059
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:42,190
struggle with it and bring it to market

1060
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:44,469
however the overarching idea there is I

1061
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:47,230
think exactly what patrick said in my

1062
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:50,079
opinion there is now a it's blurred as

1063
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:53,050
far as do you want it medical or do you

1064
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,799
want it or someone looking for you know

1065
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:59,380
medical sort of driven products or or is

1066
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,330
it is it recreational we're in

1067
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,640
California it's far and away the biggest

1068
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:05,619
the biggest market we don't look at it

1069
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:07,809
that's not a question for us medical

1070
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:09,430
from banks there's only one market yeah

1071
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:11,079
from banks perspective I don't know the

1072
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:13,389
statistic I'm sure somebody out there

1073
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:16,500
can shout it out but there's a statistic

1074
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:20,199
that says some large percentage of

1075
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:23,440
recreational users are using cannabis

1076
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:25,480
for medical reasons so you don't need

1077
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,570
the brand I think to Bobbi's point to be

1078
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,769
medically oriented because the consumers

1079
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,960
deciding what they're using it for

1080
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:33,130
whether they're using it recreationally

1081
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,750
to get high with their friends or

1082
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,670
they're using it to sleep or they're

1083
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,880
using it for pain relief I think the

1084
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:41,309
brand has to be compelling and

1085
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,259
has to be safe and it has to provide a

1086
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:45,480
service that people are looking for but

1087
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:48,048
if you orient it medically I think

1088
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,579
you're leaving a lot on the table I

1089
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:53,940
wouldn't bet I wouldn't recommend it MJ

1090
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:56,250
biz and new frontier data did a study

1091
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,210
and they came out with a report called

1092
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,818
arc types

1093
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:02,009
it's very available I don't know what

1094
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:04,889
what the cost is these days but it's not

1095
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:08,759
a lot but it's a very valuable report

1096
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:11,368
because its segments older users and

1097
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:13,380
different types it's a study that I have

1098
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:14,940
never seen before the industry was

1099
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,920
astonished and I think you should all

1100
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,929
take a look at it because what we're

1101
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,150
seeing is we're seeing many many many

1102
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:24,449
different niches in the buying public

1103
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:27,059
and those niches will become forces as

1104
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:29,578
we do our research and deliver more

1105
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,048
products to market I believe thank you

1106
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,670
so very much I hate to cut everybody off

1107
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:35,599
a we're way over time one more time

1108
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,599
super great
