00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:12,539
very cool from Japan to whites give you

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:14,580
have received her PhD in chemically from

3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,989
Muhammad University in Wellman drop me

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,990
in Raqqa my mother commits in the

5
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:20,989
hospital

6
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:33,439
your company is in marketing laboratory

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:44,549
devices are also kind of emotional

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:45,869
possibilities from you company focuses

9
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,459
on your equipment

10
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,058
what would the company need to produce

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,198
GMP can abstract extracts in Germany are

12
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,769
in excellent I have a short version of

13
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,079
the list

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,170
yeah yeah but here's a longer version

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,079
yes so basically when you go to GOP

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,689
correction yeah it's a publicly

17
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,359
available of this all things that you

18
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:12,239
need to do yes what's concerns over

19
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,549
these consoles equipment in a new

20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,868
location

21
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:18,590
atchoo into this very get your stuff

22
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:21,840
from also the lessons that you use

23
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,049
expection and also about documentation

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,950
yes who it's a very long this the basic

25
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:35,100
usually is one of you have to come very

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,780
high to regulations yes and what I what

27
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,349
you need to think about this advice be

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,118
three steps you know one thing has to

29
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:48,149
get your stuff home do you know you're

30
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:51,030
if you're Robert Boyles yeah you know

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,719
when it was Roman can you have it we

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,540
have no my god

33
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:59,759
Buddhist yes this is one thing and then

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,030
you also have to easily document and

35
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,030
come

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,969
[Music]

37
00:02:21,250 --> 00:03:39,920
yeah yeah yeah please ask your trusted

38
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:42,049
if more question on that in Germany for

39
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,809
example describe a type of practice

40
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,629
occurs in Switzerland and in Germany

41
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,519
there is a complete loss we have

42
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:53,370
certified medical cannabis for masters

43
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,490
of pharmacy in Switzerland there

44
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,490
[Music]

45
00:04:00,959 --> 00:05:45,699
which is because I have to partner up

46
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,680
for somebody at the start so facts about

47
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:50,829
somebody this will comes up in certified

48
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,800
it's necessary or you find a company

49
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:56,319
that has a cheap realize yes making your

50
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,800
stuff then you have only to take care

51
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,009
about your is you intrude yeah and then

52
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:09,120
find another for example

53
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:12,689
it doesn't a kitchen for me and my last

54
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,970
question on this topic and how which

55
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,279
which will be the we talking about

56
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,170
extraction products yes so for which

57
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,000
purpose who append a product and do

58
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,629
licensee I'm Switzerland as long as

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,029
there's no medical law for cannabis

60
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:30,209
that's a record of recreational yeah so

61
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:32,519
it's no less and as we can all right

62
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:35,279
so basically the only limit that you

63
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:38,039
have to test is the HD on time to put at

64
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,889
each day but there's no about how much

65
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,530
DVDs you should have in your package in

66
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,860
oil and extract so basically you can

67
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:50,579
pass some olive oil without any kind of

68
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,879
CD as long as your street-chic on you

69
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:57,089
know on percent yeah and so what I have

70
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:00,209
now is people were doing to change the

71
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:05,159
content that's additionally in guchi to

72
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:07,079
avoid a taxation yes if you don't test

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:13,260
one cookie you have to pay an extra

74
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:17,310
tricks okay thank you very much

75
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:21,810
and I think I'm going to you don't know

76
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,129
you know he's these like 80s 1998 you

77
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,220
know has been questioned at the bottom

78
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:28,139
and CBD have extraction and today as US

79
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,720
company he raises them to the rank of

80
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,789
apps extract a consulting for different

81
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,020
companies tremendous expert working with

82
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,900
the best breeders

83
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,180
at the other pucon 60 degrees and VP

84
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,399
laps with us I've done Frank Kevin

85
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,129
Joseph repeal up specializes in the

86
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,859
research of distribution on CBD hemp and

87
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:49,500
very wise and you know you are not a

88
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,069
real your own videos national robotics

89
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,810
trash and the basis of any instructions

90
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,439
which all of us have with less than 1%

91
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,689
THC if you produce CDJ extracts the THC

92
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,779
concentration maybe some is a true

93
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:09,529
that's true yeah

94
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:09,529
even the first easier step 2

95
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:17,430
to make that Campion just easy just say

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,509
before we are you or with the solvent

97
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:24,269
and then you keep it little one my

98
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,599
company we will make different technical

99
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:30,779
give me the duck down first with the

100
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,080
starting material we make kind of

101
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:37,408
process to get some extra people one

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:44,360
person we can also do it during the

103
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:50,850
extraction with a co2 system co2 system

104
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:52,500
just take out and also post extraction

105
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,589
we have different technique by

106
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:04,230
destination by selectively a

107
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:06,000
visualization and so it's one thing what

108
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,710
you would consider as a middle of

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,049
extraction this specific whose extract

110
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,470
me are you doing yeah because I only

111
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:19,139
heard so far that it still looted but I

112
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,750
have never heard that the CBD is like

113
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:25,409
separated from the THC after the

114
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,899
extraction yeah so we make a process

115
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:33,809
then we can eliminate the CBD after

116
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:39,870
extraction in the in the tree but that's

117
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:46,939
a very complex pressure if different

118
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:49,289
kind of thing and then you know we come

119
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:54,260
with the most important in the next

120
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:59,539
option for overseas the surgeries first

121
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:04,889
security then and then good stuff here

122
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:06,689
and I come back to a company like long

123
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,360
let me introduce Vincent before because

124
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,870
we're really short on time and we listen

125
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,169
this so the first time is we on the

126
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,639
podium and is a co-founder of CEO of the

127
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:21,349
curator of unity of Sh

128
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,569
telephone in Dayton destroyed it is

129
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,870
reading cannabis from a crooked over -

130
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,540
oh they're partners worldwide in active

131
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,778
operations in LA we are Europe and South

132
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:43,519
America and in shark you are a real

133
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:46,159
expert in extracting so your company

134
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,769
focuses on non phobic solutions and your

135
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,028
people will think of opera fama making

136
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,710
hash in the plastic bowl

137
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:54,470
I want something common with new

138
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:57,560
technology and approach you know you do

139
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,080
not call them the extraction yeah we

140
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,109
focus on 9000 extraction after Ashoka's

141
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,330
originally sovereign status but we

142
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:09,769
started it's a rosin extraction

143
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:11,930
equipment and idea behind problem

144
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,139
extracts hasn't changed much since the

145
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:17,870
Moroccan old beating is still pretty

146
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:21,199
much similar reforms of solvent

147
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,820
extraction I was categorize further

148
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,839
categorize solvent extraction will be

149
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:30,770
dry stick rosin and I swear - so dry sip

150
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,410
or mechanical separation rosin which is

151
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:36,049
using heat and pressure or ice water -

152
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:37,759
which is using cold water those are all

153
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,109
different ways to use non solvents

154
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,879
although some people can say water is a

155
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,950
solvent but I rather than solving its

156
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:56,539
like homes in moves away from the player

157
00:11:45,950 --> 00:12:00,350
to play materially a vessel yeah and so

158
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:01,610
what we hear from you is the techniques

159
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,649
of iconoclast

160
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,320
in California because it's a legal

161
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:09,470
market and you can work openly so I

162
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,410
would say in general to take the pocket

163
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,930
in California is very paragraph and

164
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:16,789
comes with high construction on the

165
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:19,909
other hand we have German and Swiss

166
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:23,659
companies when it does when it comes to

167
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:26,208
extraction from hop and other plants

168
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:28,759
which are not cannabis where Europe

169
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,919
Europe is well Peter what would you say

170
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,149
what could those two industry to learn

171
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,669
from each other because they are

172
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,250
basically doing the same thing they make

173
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:39,949
a full full spectrum extraction of

174
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,629
plants these are two different totally

175
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:48,950
different industry what was a lot for me

176
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:59,899
cause I hope you take relax sure I think

177
00:12:48,950 --> 00:13:23,450
right now the u.s. is open their eyes

178
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:29,539
and their analytics they're really good

179
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:31,009
about you back to how like just

180
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:31,610
whistling the Germans are leaders and

181
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:35,299
extracts

182
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,399
other things I think as the Swiss

183
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:39,109
Germans Europe starts to play and this

184
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,939
is where they're gonna continue to be

185
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:50,779
experts and interactions you're just

186
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:53,030
having had a time to play and let's go

187
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:57,679
back to Jana Jana my next question to

188
00:13:53,029 --> 00:14:00,889
you is he right now allows business

189
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,379
multi are you expert materializes in

190
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,970
which way heavier companies of marcus

191
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:06,970
lepidus authorization

192
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:32,539
Hahnemann trying to find the best ways

193
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:42,349
also some additional comments we're

194
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:44,929
trying to find the best way maybe a

195
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:52,430
plant and you tell me this is my boy - I

196
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:56,870
can just and the second thing is facing

197
00:14:52,429 --> 00:15:04,849
me anyway if you go through this was Jim

198
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:49,698
watch you be the same let me ask

199
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:52,339
additionally because the so what I

200
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:55,818
actually wanted to ask is is there any

201
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:58,730
specific years is there any specific

202
00:15:55,818 --> 00:16:01,698
heat for cannabis analyzers of cannabis

203
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,430
extraction you don't get you don't have

204
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:07,370
fun with other plants do you get respect

205
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:09,948
from from scientists that say okay I

206
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:13,578
need this or this special developed

207
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:15,169
equipment for - well I think what you

208
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:17,239
have to think about is I mean I mean if

209
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:20,808
you go for some experience doing

210
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:25,178
exceptional hops specialization you know

211
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:28,909
it's usually grown somewhere in Europe

212
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:31,458
legally by trauma yeah if you go to a

213
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,689
cannabis market yeah if you grow

214
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,489
cannabis

215
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,279
so that you can be sure if you should

216
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:40,519
not have any kind of toxic metals inside

217
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:45,009
your yeah but you should know where your

218
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:48,289
house on the downside somewhere between

219
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:50,899
yeah I mean you cannot be sure that

220
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:53,629
there's some toxic metals inside and

221
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:56,629
I've seen one case of a patient and the

222
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:57,860
hospital was poisoned by marijuana and

223
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,120
he had a deep poisoning

224
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:05,870
it was not a boxing with the marijuana

225
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:11,240
he died awfully pardon me yeah somewhere

226
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:15,938
you didn't know and it was because if

227
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:19,150
you don't you get in trouble

228
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:26,750
okay controlling input is fine nice

229
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:29,210
Mikey work for or you know we talking

230
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:35,538
about caliber needs DHCC believe all the

231
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:37,788
time perhaps what Walter B's who you all

232
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:40,759
can you also extract our kids understand

233
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:46,490
that has a target school is there any

234
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:49,250
amount on my leg romantic hero on the

235
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:53,120
moment we just not focus on thirteen

236
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:56,450
because it's actually difficult to walk

237
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,428
with some CBD strains we go one person

238
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,730
you get good fragrance but not the real

239
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:04,780
presence of will th see straight road

240
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:09,130
number so in America there is a lot of

241
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:12,109
perfect having already because they get

242
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,500
stopped in like they have to do it we

243
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:19,788
make up in by this division from the

244
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:23,929
extras in our company and we make with

245
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:26,869
its exclusion from zucchini plant and we

246
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:29,870
mix different different kind of fun to

247
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:31,609
me but there's a team at other market

248
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:34,099
also gotta step in a structure or

249
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:38,229
whatever you say inches in alley we'd

250
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:38,230
start actually we're not

251
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:52,300
and let's go to witnesses they often

252
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:55,000
pull up on all the mistakes concentrates

253
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:58,299
I say let me get some charts

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,890
so Church sir teens has become one of

255
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,899
the hottest keywords there is in

256
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,600
candidates in California right now to

257
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:08,830
flavor the aroma and the feelings that

258
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:10,659
the chart profile contributes is huge so

259
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:13,509
up here right now we're talking a lot

260
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:16,380
about CBD isolate distillate those are

261
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:18,940
concentrates for short but that's not

262
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,920
concentrated when I find a concentrated

263
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,009
a market selling concentrates a

264
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,360
concentrate in the market of California

265
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:29,079
when someone wants to concentrate on

266
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:33,879
market is a jar of rosin or shatter or

267
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:36,189
cromwell or vho of some fashion and it

268
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,610
has a turn profile considered with it

269
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,650
like the flavor and aroma and the fact

270
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:45,089
that you get from the whole sensation is

271
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:47,590
what that concentrated is known for CBD

272
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:49,359
isolate and dislike it has its place and

273
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:51,759
i see more of a place as it moves

274
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,719
towards medical or as supplements or

275
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,099
food it's great as ingredients a

276
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,279
connoisseur market of kindness

277
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:02,459
concentrates it's not about isolating

278
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,859
it's about the full spectrum is about

279
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,049
entourage effect is about all the

280
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:09,969
cannabinoids not just cqd into each seed

281
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,740
is that on your other ones that we don't

282
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,450
talk about it all right now and it's

283
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,069
about how those kind of toys interact

284
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,558
with each other along with the turqu

285
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:20,529
paint robots that's the true magic of

286
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:21,970
this plant is how all of that combines

287
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,639
each other and that's why none of us

288
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,019
fully understand it yet because it's all

289
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,970
those different parts playing together

290
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:30,599
at once that give us these feelings of

291
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,250
why we love this plant do what we do so

292
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,389
sure people from other industries think

293
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,769
that we're going to come in and we're

294
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,810
going to

295
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:38,849
same thing we do with sage we're gonna

296
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,990
strap one thing but the thing is we're

297
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:42,179
extracting one thing we're forgetting

298
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,039
about the 99 other things that flames of

299
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,070
the fact that that we need to consider

300
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,659
right now so so let me ask again because

301
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:51,450
this is I think is a right more topic

302
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,550
that is the different between isolating

303
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,890
and extraction which a lot of people

304
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,849
especially who are not so much into the

305
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,100
topic

306
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:00,779
do not read it do not recognize is that

307
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,279
right that what you mean sure well

308
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,349
isolation is a type of extraction

309
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,079
attraction means you're you're

310
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:09,480
condensing the categories and into a

311
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,189
more concentrated forms goal means

312
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,049
concentrates are taking the cannabis

313
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,340
plant you're getting a lot rid of

314
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:16,019
everything else was so so they have

315
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,179
going to the trophies of the concentrate

316
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,369
we're isolating danger distilling things

317
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,860
were further concentrating work now

318
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:25,500
we're isolating into your CBD or TMC

319
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,869
your CV and anything else you want your

320
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,400
terpenes your your individual chart

321
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,750
means your trip in place however you

322
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,970
want to break this plant down you can

323
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,589
then do it because yeah we know how to

324
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,470
separate things we can always further

325
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:39,299
separate things but I think we get too

326
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,950
far ahead of separating and completely

327
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:46,529
and before we understand before were

328
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:48,360
separated and please let me come to the

329
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:52,589
next question because I think the color

330
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:55,979
party market is dance or the US market

331
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:57,899
is very hard trance and if the

332
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,599
preconditions are equal how does the

333
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,440
debug for extracts of that Ohio cannabis

334
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,240
in general develop if all products

335
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,980
illegal yet Switzerland real good

336
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,140
situation not autonomous product a

337
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,329
leader but if given the case all of you

338
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,490
good I would ask this right shoulder on

339
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:16,769
sure I think I touch on that a little

340
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:20,130
bit of BDS analytics and concentrate

341
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:23,369
market is surpassing the cloud of market

342
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,650
flowers demo works traditional but as we

343
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:27,959
open people's eyes to more products and

344
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,680
other ways to consume

345
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:35,309
I mean I change people's thoughts

346
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,900
all data concentrates where a lot of

347
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:37,919
people are very hesitant on smoking I'm

348
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,990
straight and that's why we got into

349
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,880
solvent so I can think another part of

350
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,029
you and squish it and squeeze is

351
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,980
basically like juice

352
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:47,889
now I have a concentrate there's nothing

353
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,630
no magic in Java or anything you can do

354
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,520
any chemical process to it or anything I

355
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,260
have a concert in front of you I let you

356
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,910
smoke that concentrate and he were

357
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:56,349
traditionally smoking flower before that

358
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,390
I'll show you the proper way of slow to

359
00:22:56,349 --> 00:23:02,439
concentrate you're gonna continue small

360
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:05,290
pension tricks thank you

361
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,340
my next question goes out to you and

362
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:12,869
Rihanna as well I would say and in

363
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:16,599
Switzerland we heard we had a little bit

364
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:19,329
legal problem tooth extraction which is

365
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:21,219
not a you can I guess you really want to

366
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:24,549
because you have to stick to certain

367
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,769
limits but in general if though the

368
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:29,409
legal frame would be given do you think

369
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:31,000
Switzerland is ready to produce full

370
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,519
spectrum cannabis extracts on a

371
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,559
political level our guilt ompany is

372
00:23:33,519 --> 00:24:24,599
ready for that yes it's just the next

373
00:23:41,559 --> 00:24:26,549
step ok sharpen time today and I think I

374
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:29,309
like to us is evolution another

375
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:31,559
hypothesis questions but this is the box

376
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:34,319
that we have today and we only have

377
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:51,240
another 12 minutes for questions from

378
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:52,829
the audience a lot of these artificial

379
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,390
turf feed companies where they're like

380
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:57,269
oh we need to sell you the German

381
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:01,250
suppose push look they're dye extracted

382
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:04,160
from OG cooks or some things like that

383
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:07,079
my dream of terpenes is an isolated

384
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,240
isolated jockey the problem is like when

385
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,299
you're buying oh gee push it's somewhat

386
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,200
formulating what they say oh gee pushes

387
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:18,809
churn so i expansion like a bomb merci

388
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,390
merci and to think a combination of the

389
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:23,399
terpenes to create with is now og cush

390
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,990
there's nothing fake about those strings

391
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,390
at the end of the day so if you're if

392
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,220
you're looking for cannabis lemons and

393
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,200
Canada's effects and you want to get the

394
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,730
true kindness effects and blemish or you

395
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,779
can you can destroy proteins if you're

396
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,630
only looking for flavoring the

397
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:40,230
difference between limonene from a lemon

398
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,850
or lime from do they have the same

399
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,029
effect so you looking for campus style

400
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:47,730
effects right so mom will save you no

401
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:49,950
mercy neve tzedek hands is a THC or or

402
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,930
lemonade essence other qualities like

403
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,819
the terpenes give you difference more

404
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,560
than just GH seem to give you a

405
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,059
different effect to but do these

406
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,639
artificial burpees work the same way

407
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:02,579
yeah they're not artificial they're

408
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,470
derived yes from other location on

409
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,470
cannabis turn on cough drops are

410
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:18,120
glancing that there's a medically drive

411
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:19,160
therefore they're they're isomer may be

412
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,889
different or there

413
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,950
and answering configurations of air

414
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:27,169
molecules and it essentially in you can

415
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,720
create - maybe recreate a combination of

416
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,370
synthetically reconstituted terpenes but

417
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,079
they wouldn't necessarily do the same

418
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:35,119
ones that you would extract from the

419
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:36,649
original raw material source but my

420
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,209
question is actually pretty common they

421
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,580
don't try to make it quick like you

422
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,798
mentioned that a patient at the hospital

423
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:45,199
died from lead poisoning and that also

424
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,910
the only really real requirements in

425
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,840
Switzerland right now are to test for

426
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:54,169
CVD or THC content meaning the real 1%

427
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:57,349
and CVD sometimes I guess the test for

428
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:59,809
that thing by mixing do any of your

429
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:03,259
customers or clients actually try to

430
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:05,658
test for heavy metals because they do

431
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:08,538
test okay

432
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,350
I also have a lot of customers in the

433
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:23,029
police force

434
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:25,579
yeah if you know your source yeah if you

435
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:29,538
know you stuff go back there again you

436
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:31,250
need to test for heavy metals yeah what

437
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:33,019
I would really be always recommend you

438
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,919
to test this if you have organic hemp

439
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:38,960
where you don't use any pesticides test

440
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,110
four hundred seeds because this is their

441
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,480
entrance most toxic substance that you

442
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:47,209
can have and I mean I mean everybody

443
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,610
thinks if I was healthy and organic is

444
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:53,058
happy it's not actually if you don't

445
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:56,418
store your stuff my body let me keep it

446
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:58,849
dry in a dark place you have mold and

447
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:02,480
this move is very very toxic yeah in

448
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:03,319
small quantities so that's what we have

449
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,839
it always has

450
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,298
second thing is you don't know where

451
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,449
your stuff comes from heavy metals

452
00:28:08,298 --> 00:28:17,619
because it kills you yeah I've never

453
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:17,620
seen any kind of an issue because of the

454
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:26,800
cutsy overdoses

455
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:32,700
there's so much do we have any more

456
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,700
questions good timing man let's hear

457
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,740
[Applause]
