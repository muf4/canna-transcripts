impatiently waiting for the final

63

65
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,400
are we at and what are some of the

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,400
biggest roadblocks on a global and local

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,760
level yeah yeah we we are not done yet

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,680
don't think that so um it's almost like

69
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:45,479
a classical uh drama in five acts and I

70
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,599
will give you an overview of of that so

71
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,840
the journey began the drama began in

72
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,598
November 21 we had Federal elections and

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,680
a new government was in place a new the

74
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,639
traffic light Coalition and they

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,360
announced in November 21 that cannabis

76
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,199
will be legalized and the the uh

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,080
distribution by distribution of cannabis

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:10,359
in specialized stores in dispensaries

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,080
that was the aim in November 21 uh then

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:18,120
the increasing moment came in October uh

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,920
in October 22 uh and there was a paper

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,039
published by the Federal Ministry of

83
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,559
Health um saying okay this is our plan

84
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,438
to enroll a commercial route for

85
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,280
cannabis distribution in Germany um

86
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,878
everyone said oh yeah German is really

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,840
legalizing commercial route great um and

88
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,598
then uh the third uh the third Act was

89
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,239
uh in April

90
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,759
23 uh the federal minister of health and

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,878
the federal minister of Agriculture

92
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,479
saying okay uh the commercial route

93
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:53,840
doesn't work uh we have legal problems

94
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:57,238
uh single convention EU framework Etc uh

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,280
it's not possible we have to uh do it

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,120
the other way uh and then they presented

97
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:08,360
again a paper saying uh okay uh you are

98
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,200
only allowed to possess 25 G of cannabis

99
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,519
uh we are planning to introduce cannabis

100
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,120
cultivation associations no cannabis

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,239
Social Clubs so no cons consumation on

102
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,759
the premises uh but cannabis cultivation

103
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:25,359
Association for Collective hom grown and

104
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,680
uh the home grow of option for three

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,160
plants at at at home uh so U that was of

106
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,360
of course a big step back and uh it was

107
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,240
probably completely over regulated uh so

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,319
that was a big disappointment at at that

109
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,000
point of time uh and then we saw the

110
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:49,560
first draft in U in October in in August

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,079
last year in 23 uh and it was so heavily

112
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,079
restricted so

113
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:58,120
prohibitionist a drama nothing left over

114
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:03,399
from from the initial plans uh and um

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,519
then the the act started uh by uh even

116
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,239
these reduced plans were attacked from

117
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:11,758
all sides from uh police uh um

118
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,240
associations from uh physician

119
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,960
associations Etc uh and it was not clear

120
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,439
if these draft will enter bunak at all

121
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:27,879
uh and then uh the Ukraine war came uh

122
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:30,038
and uh the uh tax problems uh came and

123
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,120
it was scheduled for November it was

124
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,120
postponed and then um it was scheduled

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
for December postponed for January

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,199
postponed and then in February 3 weeks

127
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,639
ago the law passed bunak and now we in

128
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
the situation that the bundesrat the

129
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,319
federal Council has to approve that law

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
as well he can't really prevent it but

131
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,800
he can appeal to a mediation committee

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,399
and if that is done if they appeal next

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Friday for the mediation committee uh

134
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,679
the law can't enter into Force at 1st of

135
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,879
April and when it will enter into Force

136
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,199
course is completely open and this would

137
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:08,519
be the last Act of this classical drama

138
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,000
the catastrophe no change at all so you

139
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,879
think 1 of April is off the table it's

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,839
50/50 it's 50/50 many people are working

141
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,800
on that right now uh the um the resist

142
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,879
resistance came from the federal states

143
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,439
because they saying oh my God we have to

144
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,360
implement new administrative procedures

145
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,800
and we have to look through old criminal

146
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,919
files maybe we have to release some

147
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,639
prisoners oh we are completely

148
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:37,639
overwhelmed please stop that law and

149
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,519
this is the the problem right now but

150
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,478
are the people overthinking or is it

151
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,639
realistic concern that they have at this

152
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:46,159
moment for the changes that are

153
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,639
outstanding I I mean the the the green

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,599
party was always in favor of

155
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,478
legalization they um bought the first

156
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:57,279
bill in 2015 to bunak the Cannabis

157
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:59,639
Control Act uh and now it seems that the

158
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,719
minist the green ministers from the

159
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,918
federal states are opposing just this

160
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,599
law it would be political suicide for

161
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,639
the green party if it's in the end the F

162
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:12,918
of the green party if the law doesn't

163
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,199
come into enter into Force so I agree so

164
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,639
uh Jamie with that in the back of your

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,280
uh or with the back of our minds uh what

166
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,160
advice would you give American brands

167
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,079
who hire your group uh the New Holland

168
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,639
group for entering into you Europe what

169
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,639
are some vital aspects that they have to

170
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,439
consider when I worked at bang uh for

171
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,399
those of you that know bang chocolate I

172
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,079
ran that company for seven years and one

173
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,239
of the things I did was when I started

174
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,519
the company we were in California uh

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,639
when I left we were in seven states

176
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:48,799
Canada and I brought the CBD division

177
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,280
into Europe so my experience sort of

178
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,918
boots on the ground is navigating the

179
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,038
complexities of the legal Market

180
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,318
whatever is happening legally things

181
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:04,360
change on a dime you have to be able to

182
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,120
Pivot quickly and know how to do things

183
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,879
for example you don't want to buy

184
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,879
100,000 packages to get a cheaper rate

185
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,840
knowing that the government could on a

186
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,400
dime change something and then that

187
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:20,638
whole batch of packaging becomes

188
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,719
obsolete so I put the legal framework

189
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,400
more in the boots on the ground

190
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,280
operational um strategy and what I would

191
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:31,598
say to that what Kai just explained is

192
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,158
that you you've got a political sea you

193
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,958
know football going back and forth It's

194
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:38,679
a seesaw we don't know what's going to

195
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:43,000
happen Friday is D-Day um what I've been

196
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:46,199
telling my clients is Germany is

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,839
Pharma in in the words of Ceda Schubert

198
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,759
those of you who know her full stop

199
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:55,080
Pharma so if you want to come in and be

200
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,559
a brand you're really early it's there

201
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,440
there's no Brands right now and even in

202
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:03,399
the social model if it passes is Brands

203
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,040
aren't really a thing however if you're

204
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,839
an American brand and you have

205
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:11,599
credibility and people know you because

206
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,480
like everywhere um cannabis American

207
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,720
cannabis is in high demand especially

208
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,720
cannabis from

209
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,800
California uh so if you have a brand

210
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,879
with tremendous credibility as we've

211
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,799
witnessed with cookies that came over

212
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,240
here and has been able to open stores

213
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:30,359
and um and I don't want to open that can

214
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,240
of worms but um there is a path and

215
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,680
there's a path for doing um B to C so

216
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,278
approaching your consumer directly

217
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,120
rather than going the traditional B2B

218
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,838
route um and then going the farmer route

219
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,519
so you want to make sure that you are

220
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,680
building your brand through the

221
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,278
traditional medical um channels now one

222
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,078
thing I want to say and then you know

223
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:57,439
I'll I'll let someone else speak here

224
00:09:54,078 --> 00:10:00,199
but I think when you're talking about

225
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,000
brands in Europe you you really just

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,240
have to think about

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,839
um the European market compared to the

228
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,879
North American Market which is kind of

229
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,720
was the title of our panel in America

230
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,000
medical you have to put air quotes

231
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,759
around it because it was really just a

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,360
workaround so we could put the plant in

233
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:25,720
people's hands in Europe medical

234
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,360
actually means medical it's a doctor

235
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,879
prescription it's Health sometimes

236
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,159
health insurance if you can jump through

237
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,679
those Hoops you get the medicine at a

238
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,679
pharmacy you're not going to a

239
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,638
dispensary so all of you in Europe know

240
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,719
that but for my American Compadres

241
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,039
especially the new ones that are here

242
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,480
medical cannabis in Europe looks nothing

243
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,439
like medical cannabis in America so I

244
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,399
think that what we're seeing is that

245
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,399
those medical laws will probably loosen

246
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,440
and it'll be easier for people and

247
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,759
patients to get their hands on cannabis

248
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,560
but it's probably not going to be

249
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,720
anytime soon like what we see in the

250
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:09,359
recreational states in the

251
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,680
US thank you so uh AR um as an American

252
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,839
company operating in the North American

253
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,278
cannabis market for more than eight

254
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,079
years uh or um how do how long ago did

255
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,919
you begin to prepare to enter for the

256
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,919
European market and what steps did you

257
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,278
take and what were the most difficult

258
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,078
challenges also coming here with an

259
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,360
American perspective uh to

260
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:35,399
Europe thank Thank you

261
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,079
Lisa I come back to Europe with a view

262
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,480
from my previous chapter when I lived in

263
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,919
Europe and I was country manager of

264
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,440
Astra now Astra zenica and when I left

265
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,719
Astra I didn't think I was going to go

266
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,399
be going back into the Pharma business

267
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,680
and so I returned back to the United

268
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,519
States acquired this company

269
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,278
seal and we were in the recreational

270
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,839
market for all intents and purposes as

271
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:58,278
as Jamie mentioned medical cannabis in

272
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,040
the United States was really just a

273
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:03,278
pathway to get to

274
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,480
recreational uh here in Europe

275
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,399
microphone up high we need your

276
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,320
microphone up by your mouth okay here in

277
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,440
Europe uh it is as Jamie said very much

278
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,399
of a pharmaceutical market and so I look

279
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,079
back to those days at Astra when we had

280
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,759
reps detailing doctors educating doctors

281
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:26,278
solving distribution problems uh for

282
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:28,559
pharmacies so uh we had to you know go

283
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,480
back to the old Playbook and so we

284
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,359
re-entered or we entered the European

285
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,920
market a few years ago you know it's a

286
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,360
GMP market and our equipment is is

287
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,639
qualified for GMP certification I was in

288
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,919
a customers facility yesterday in

289
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,000
Portugal and I can tell you there's not

290
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:48,479
a single North American facility that

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,159
looks like this facility I saw yesterday

292
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,600
in Portugal and then it is it is clean

293
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:59,799
GMP the processes is professional and

294
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,240
so I think the jury I mean the pathway

295
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,559
as Jamie said is very clear it is Pharma

296
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,360
it's going to stay Pharma Recreation is

297
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,399
not on the horizon here there's probably

298
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,159
a little room for brands in the

299
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,159
traditional sense uh in the European

300
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,480
market for years to come uh but we're

301
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,759
very excited and I look forward to being

302
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,839
back in the Pharma business in Europe I

303
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:24,439
will say OIC is a brand and it's a

304
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,680
Pharma brand so there is a ability to

305
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,240
Brand Pharma but we're so early it's

306
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,838
it's not not time for that

307
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,120
yet but do you see also many differences

308
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,199
on how business is done here like in

309
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,759
comparison to the states differ how

310
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:45,159
business is done

311
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,600
here the the United States uh you know

312
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,600
it's a go- go market I mean you have

313
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,278
Legacy Growers you have institutional

314
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,759
investors here it's much more of a

315
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:59,480
steady slow organic growth I don't think

316
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,839
there's going to be seismic changes uh

317
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,680
like you might see in the United States

318
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,920
and Chloe hit it uh this morning the

319
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,120
earlier panel that we're all now waiting

320
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,360
for the DEA to endorse or not endorse uh

321
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,240
the rescheduling of of cannabis from

322
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,759
narcotic I'd say that the Germans may

323
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,198
have beat us to the punch but the jury's

324
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,240
out till next Friday but it's going to

325
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:22,000
be very

326
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,919
steadied growth I don't see any

327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,039
hyperbolic growth that you saw in the

328
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,319
United States which is arguably a $30

329
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,639
billion market now uh I don't have a

330
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,720
hard number for Europe but it is a

331
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,000
fraction of that but we have Bitcoin so

332
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,199
we're all

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,240
okay so Jimmy back to you um like more

334
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,838
also from a commercial strategy point of

335
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,278
view um what has changed about uh your

336
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,680
view of the European cannabis industry

337
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,078
since the German and Dutch W or maybe

338
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:57,439
even since you started entering yeah yes

339
00:14:53,078 --> 00:15:00,958
so I I entered the European market in

340
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,240
2016 um it's hard hard to believe yeah

341
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,679
in dog years was does that make me a

342
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,680
hundred um

343
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:11,919
and that market we were so hopeful and

344
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,559
every year it's kind of cannabis you

345
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,559
know we always say and then cannabis

346
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,278
happened um you just get kicked in the

347
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,679
teeth you know you think you're going to

348
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,799
make big progress and you really don't

349
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,679
and I don't want to be Debbie Downer but

350
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:29,359
but what's changed for me as I realize

351
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:32,599
um I actually think the European can AB

352
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,919
Market is doing it right in comparison

353
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,879
with the American Market because we have

354
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:41,318
so many problems with uh the illicit

355
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:43,519
Market um I I don't believe that it

356
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:46,318
should be a situation where you've got

357
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,759
people in prison for this plant and then

358
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:52,278
what you do is you legalize it but then

359
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,519
you create a new set of criminals quote

360
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:58,159
unquote um which are the people that

361
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:01,560
open or have elicit dispensaries so in

362
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:04,799
2018 for example in California uh we had

363
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:08,239
3,000 dispensaries it goes wreck there's

364
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:13,240
only 300 legal dispensaries the next day

365
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:16,959
all 3,000 stayed open now you've got

366
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,680
2,700 new criminals instead of lowering

367
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,758
the bar and letting the people that were

368
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:26,159
operating you know enter the legal

369
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,480
market and I I am hoping that in Europe

370
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:32,039
which has a robust illicit Market

371
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,399
everybody uses cannabis um that there's

372
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:38,958
a pathway to not create new criminals

373
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,919
and I think that part of the

374
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,399
delays thank

375
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:47,120
you I think part of the delays are about

376
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,600
the lawmakers are not

377
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,000
jockeying um Us Versus Them which is the

378
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,600
problem we have in the US it's Democrats

379
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
versus Republicans well if they if they

380
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,480
do the bill then we're not going to

381
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,600
approve it and all that kind of stuff

382
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,159
here very thoughtful you've got a

383
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,679
parliamentary process you've got

384
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:09,000
coalitions that are all putting their

385
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,959
stakeholders and their policies in place

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,679
and and bringing the concerns that they

387
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,199
have to the table and I think one of the

388
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,120
big concerns is criminal justice and I

389
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,759
think part of that is what is causing

390
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,038
some of this delay and I'm I'm grateful

391
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:28,038
for that I'm grateful that there is eug

392
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,599
GMP so the the medicine is coming out of

393
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,359
clean facility

394
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,879
because I can tell you I have

395
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:38,519
toured probably near a thousand grows in

396
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,080
my life and um and some of the best ones

397
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,119
are here in Europe for sure so I think

398
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:45,000
the Europeans might not be getting it

399
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,239
right all the way but I think they're

400
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,200
getting a lot of it right maybe uh just

401
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,798
out of the regular question here Kai can

402
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,720
you give a little comment on social

403
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,240
justice in Germany and how this is

404
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,640
developing and this discussion is

405
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,000
developing and with

406
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,480
amnesty so social social justice yeah

407
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,519
that is exactly the point where these U

408
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,279
Ministry ministers from the federal

409
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,558
states are complaining because they

410
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:15,440
would have to go through 100,000 cases

411
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:18,038
uh to see if they have to be ricated

412
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,919
these convictions and uh we have too

413
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,000
little staff we can't we can't do that

414
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,120
let's skip that let's skip that and then

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,839
we will consent to the to the to the

416
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:30,839
bill that's uh so much to social justice

417
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:34,839
awareness of politicians in Germany

418
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:36,399
thank you so um AR um like in Germany we

419
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,119
have talked about that market we have

420
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
roughly sometime between something

421
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:43,279
between 20 to 30 tons of medicinal

422
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,759
cannabis flour Imports in 2023 so far

423
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,639
reported um in some individual states in

424
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,879
the US you have hundreds of tons Alone

425
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:57,000
um so is Europe uh even on the mark uh

426
00:18:51,880 --> 00:19:00,400
on the radar of um American companies

427
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,759
so I'm going to give an an example of uh

428
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,720
just one state and this is really the

429
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:08,158
opportunity that Europe has I'm going to

430
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:12,880
use scale so if Germany last last year

431
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,120
was 30 tons approximately of of flour

432
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,159
most of it

433
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:21,719
imported uh one State

434
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:24,200
Michigan consumed 160 tons of flour one

435
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,640
state so you you amplify that and if you

436
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,798
want to use that as a benchmark to what

437
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,640
the European market could look like you

438
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:31,720
know greater population

439
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,240
the opportunity is enormous even if it

440
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,319
just stays medical the opportunity is

441
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,120
enormous so we're all here in early days

442
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,480
and all that groundwork is being done on

443
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:44,119
the regulatory front uh Germany leading

444
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,640
the way but I think it's going to be

445
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,119
very interesting with the European

446
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,759
Parliament elections coming up uh what

447
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,119
the European Parliament does and I'm

448
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,839
going to ask our German colleagues a

449
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:57,000
return question how do you see the

450
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,279
European Parliament uh you know how this

451
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,798
playing out in the European Parliament

452
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,798
not just in

453
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,439
Germany on a European level that's a

454
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,159
good question um but it's like I don't

455
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,720
know we all don't have a grass bubble

456
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,960
that we can look into that's a little

457
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,000
bit the problem but hopefully um and uh

458
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,400
I hope many of you are also working on

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,319
that within the countries that we come

460
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,400
together and that we really lobby as a

461
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:27,158
European industry because that is

462
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,080
something that uh we have been missing

463
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,960
in Germany we had our first industry

464
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:34,720
Association in 2019 and the thing that

465
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,679
we all need to do do more and also more

466
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,519
jointly is to really Lobby on a European

467
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,120
level especially with the European

468
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:45,119
elections coming up

469
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,239
soon sorry yeah yeah no it's fine we

470
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,558
just continue with the questions here

471
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
because we're also we have an echo yeah

472
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,960
yeah we have an echo up here like

473
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,240
sometimes we

474
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,000
like um so uh Kai we have a the

475
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,400
rescheduling in or the reeval valuation

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,480
of the laws in Germany Does this does

477
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,159
not only have impact on the um

478
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,759
recreational part but also on the

479
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,320
medical part and on the hemp sector um

480
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,079
what do you expect for the future of

481
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,879
these areas um and also in yeah regard

482
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:19,199
to Global development and upcoming

483
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,320
European election yeah sure so uh once

484
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,278
again if the law if they appeal to the

485
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,278
um mediation committee next week uh the

486
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:29,798
law won't pass at the 1st of April when

487
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:33,000
it will pass then is completely unclear

488
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:35,480
it maybe fails at all but if it um

489
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
enters into Force at the 1 of April

490
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,240
cannabis will be rescheduled and not

491
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,240
part of the narcotic act anymore it will

492
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,400
be a regular commodity highly regulated

493
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,000
though but a regular commodity that's

494
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,400
one advantage of

495
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,599
course and as a regular commodity as a

496
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,720
regular medicine you don't need a a

497
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,199
narcotic prescription anymore you don't

498
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,120
have to obey these safety regulations

499
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,519
anymore or lesser documentation um

500
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:07,678
obligations Etc so that was would be a

501
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,679
big a big Advantage uh and um it would

502
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,240
access easy the access for medical

503
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,960
patients as as well in Germany because

504
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,839
then the stigma is gone and you can uh

505
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,159
prescribe cannabis for back pain

506
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,038
basically it's no problem then anymore

507
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,440
and uh every the medical import

508
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,679
companies of course they hope for this

509
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,440
they hope for this

510
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,400
boost and that patients numbers will

511
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,120
will Wise by by that I I just want to

512
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,320
add the the German law will benefit the

513
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:40,439
patients more prescribing doctors in

514
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,359
Germany the change the rescheduling if

515
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,640
the rescheduling occurs in the United

516
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,079
States it will have very little impact

517
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,559
on patients it'll have a huge impact on

518
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,720
the Growers because of the tax

519
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:55,480
implications 28e it's an Arcane IRS rule

520
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,720
but they be be able to depreciate

521
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,599
but that rescheduling plays out

522
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,240
differently in the

523
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:06,439
markets thank you for that addition um

524
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,120
so maybe can can I uh add something and

525
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:13,080
uh the the most surprising development

526
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:15,399
showed up in November uh as they um um

527
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,558
published the mandments to the law which

528
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,000
is now coming into force is that all

529
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:22,879
restrictions on medical medical cannabis

530
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,798
cultivation will be lifted so everyone

531
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,919
who wants to produce who wants to

532
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,158
cultivate cannabis medical cannabis

533
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,120
according to pharmaceutical grade will

534
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,400
be can can do so uh and um we have three

535
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,399
domestical licenses already in place by

536
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,360
deman Aurora and tillay and they are

537
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,720
only allowed to produce 10 tons in um

538
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:46,119
four years lifted they are only allowed

539
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,880
to produce three strains lifted uh and

540
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,199
every company there's no restrictions on

541
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,360
the number of companies so if you want

542
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,798
to grow medical cannabis in Germany you

543
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,439
can do that with the with the new law uh

544
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:58,879
and then you have to think of the single

545
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,480
Convention of article 21 which is

546
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,400
basically saying uh the more you produce

547
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,200
domestically the less you can import so

548
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
this has the potential to change the

549
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,120
whole scene uh and in the long to in the

550
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,038
short in the mid to long run you

551
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,599
probably will have to produce cannabis

552
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,480
medical cannabis in Germany if you want

553
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,558
to distribute it in in Germany so you

554
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,558
take a close look on on that how that

555
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,639
will unfold very

556
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,678
important okay thank you so um the final

557
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,120
question to all of your panelists maybe

558
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,919
starting with you Jamie um what will be

559
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:32,439
the biggest surprise in Europe in the

560
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,440
next 12

561
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,679
month well it won't be a surprise to me

562
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:42,759
um but I think what will be surprising

563
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:46,200
to the government is that the efforts to

564
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:48,599
decriminalize the lifting of the limits

565
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,558
is going to create an environment where

566
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,959
cannabis is ubiquitous and it's going to

567
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:56,200
be very difficult for the police to

568
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,000
start enforcing and I think what you're

569
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,360
going to have is a free for-all

570
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,359
and they're going to underestimate the

571
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,959
entrepreneurial Spirit around cannabis

572
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,959
and so you're going to have I think an

573
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,399
illicit Market explode that they're

574
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,759
going to have a very difficult time

575
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:18,119
controlling because if you're a police

576
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,599
officer uh in Spain for example because

577
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,798
there's no borders you go over to

578
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,599
Germany you buy something that's adult

579
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,240
use you bring it over it's

580
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,439
decriminalized here you can have it it's

581
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,038
going to be May him it's going to be

582
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,399
chaos that's what I

583
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,440
predict I

584
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,119
agree I'm going to go with the short

585
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,798
term and see what happens a week from

586
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,599
tomorrow in

587
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,359
Germany not 12 months because I think

588
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,359
what happens in Germany is a bell

589
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:49,319
weather for the EU Parliament and and

590
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:53,119
the tone it's going to have implications

591
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:55,240
for Spain uh as uh Carla mentioned in

592
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,439
the earlier panel and it's going to

593
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,399
provide if it passes political cover for

594
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,519
politicians or in the United States if

595
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:04,839
the DEA passes it it'll give political

596
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,398
cover then for our politicians our

597
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:09,199
dysfunctional political government in

598
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:11,759
the United States to possibly change the

599
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,919
tone in Washington they're not going to

600
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,640
do

601
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,840
that they're not going to do that

602
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,320
they're not going to change their tone

603
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,918
yeah but that's something very critical

604
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,678
that I think is we are heading in that

605
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,480
direction where we have a cou all

606
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,960
different countries all finding

607
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,880
different regulations it's no harmonized

608
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,640
Market many bottlenecks

609
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,880
and that's something uh we as an

610
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,600
industry also need to try to avoid and

611
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,278
create more harmonized regulations

612
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,678
across Europe and not only for

613
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:40,880
individual

614
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,960
countries Kai what's your biggest

615
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,120
surprise next

616
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,840
Friday no they will be a lot of

617
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,719
surprises coming up over the year I I

618
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,678
guess as it has been the last two years

619
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,759
as we try to legalize or decriminalize

620
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:59,240
or whatever with cannabis in Germany um

621
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:02,119
but um As It Seems there is a developing

622
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,319
a sort of European Standard for for

623
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,959
legalization if you look at Malta if you

624
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,240
look at Luxemburg if you look at Germany

625
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,399
and the Czech Republic announced

626
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,519
something similar so this cannabis

627
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:15,639
cultivation model with 500 um members

628
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,960
maximum uh and this three plant at home

629
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,919
seems to develop to a European Standard

630
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,679
which uh um a member State can easily

631
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,360
adopt and apply without getting into

632
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,559
conflict with the EU commission and we

633
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,839
will see that with Czech Republic as

634
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:34,038
well probably uh and then we will have

635
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:37,119
the EU elections for the EU Parliament

636
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:40,679
uh in in summertime in June uh and there

637
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,038
are already working groups of um MPS in

638
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,960
the European Parliament working on

639
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:47,798
cannabis reform uh on a European level

640
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,399
the EU framework decision from 2004 we

641
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:53,599
know that the Shang acree uh all having

642
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,518
regulations on cannabis in place which

643
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,839
makes the legalization so difficult

644
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:01,200
right now um and I think if the new

645
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,319
Parliament comes in after the summer

646
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,080
break we may see some surprises there

647
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,200
and some initiatives to reform these

648
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,720
legal framework on the EU level I'm I'm

649
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,960
pretty sure that will happen do you

650
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,480
think some of those surprises will be

651
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:20,200
positive uh yeah yeah yeah because uh

652
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,399
the framework decision from 2004 is

653
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,480
under the uh old legal framework of the

654
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:28,839
U of the Nitsa framework and uh it's

655
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,558
politically not

656
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,199
really um legitimate legitimate it

657
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:38,839
wasn't decided by the parliament it was

658
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:43,399
an off record decision so to say uh and

659
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:45,879
it's not uh viable for uh for preventing

660
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:47,678
legalization anymore but it's in place

661
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,559
so you have to deal with that and if you

662
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,480
change that you can go further than

663
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,599
cannabis cultivation associations and

664
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,720
and decommunization you can then think

665
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,439
of the commercial route and all the

666
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,360
tools which are in place on the single

667
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,278
convention level with interc agreements

668
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,678
Etc well I think the other big surprise

669
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:09,119
that we know is coming is these pilot

670
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,798
programs we don't know what that's going

671
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,518
to look like necessarily but we know

672
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:15,000
with some certainty who the players are

673
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,880
going to be that are going to come in

674
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,200
with money yeah but those discussions

675
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,880
are just starting so at the pilot

676
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,798
projects of course yeah they announced

677
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,640
that they will if the law passes next

678
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,599
week they will immediately start working

679
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,200
on the pilot project um and uh

680
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,319
for the pilot projects you have to

681
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,679
cultivate cannabis as well in Germany so

682
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,519
it's maybe not a bad idea to start a

683
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,960
cannabis cultivation in Germany to be

684
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,319
prepared for model B for the model

685
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,519
projects and for the for the next steps

686
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,278
five six seven years ahead yeah maybe

687
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,120
just as a little comment to the audience

688
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,038
also like the pillar two is for

689
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:53,558
evaluating the commercial part so you

690
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:56,079
can already do an now scientific

691
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:58,158
research and uh research in those kind

692
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,079
of areas so that's also something that

693
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,200
be done way more but um we're going to

694
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,639
open the floor for questions now maybe

695
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,759
Misha your uh your main surprise of uh

696
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,960
the next 12 months what is

697
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:14,119
yours uh I also have to wait till next

698
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,640
Friday I would say and uh another

699
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:19,678
surprise is uh what Jamie just mentioned

700
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,320
uh there will be no legal

701
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,880
Supply or legal possession in the

702
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,558
beginning and what we never discussed so

703
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,360
far is uh that pharmacies they don't pay

704
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:31,639
taxes

705
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,918
they pay taxes but they pay less taxes

706
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,880
and if you look at the pricing right now

707
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,038
and this is also my first question that

708
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,799
may may go out to Kai maybe when I look

709
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:45,919
at the pricing of Pharmacy right now do

710
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:48,398
you think uh they will be like uh in

711
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,480
competition because it's also in

712
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,719
competition with shops and clubs because

713
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,720
it's also as we heard very easy to have

714
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,120
a prescription very soon all the

715
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,480
restrictions fall and when I look at the

716
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,638
pricing in pharmacy it starts at 550

717
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,038
right now and it's becoming cheaper do

718
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:05,798
you think they'll have there'll be in

719
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:09,119
competition with the clubs and the uh

720
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:11,839
and the shops which will

721
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:16,158
come yeah

722
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:19,599
um if I would be allowed to uh have a

723
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:23,399
proper hom grow um I probably wouldn't

724
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:25,199
take uh prescriptions anymore um you

725
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:27,959
know that it's a big it's a huge

726
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,480
potential for for hom grow in in Germany

727
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,480
uh in every municipality in every County

728
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,278
you have at least three hops selling uh

729
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,360
stuff and accessories for the last third

730
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,919
three four centuries so it's already

731
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,879
there and it will it will boom

732
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,200
definitely if you can do it legally many

733
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,159
many people will try that and uh but if

734
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,360
you look at the demand uh we were

735
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,080
talking about that with B last night the

736
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:57,959
hup study assumes 400 to 600 tons Bo

737
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:02,038
Whitney says no it's 900 tons uh

738
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:07,000
probably 1,000 tons uh so uh if you

739
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:09,638
really uh go if if you if if the the the

740
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,359
the usual um

741
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:14,359
Stoner transforms or switches switches

742
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,558
to the medical Market there's enough

743
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,278
potential for for everyone so no real

744
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,519
competition I

745
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:24,359
guess uh I'm gassa kashu the founder of

746
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,599
can Portugal it's an expo on hen

747
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:31,839
cannabis in Lisbon and I have a question

748
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:36,359
to to uh nman because you told a couple

749
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:39,359
of times that uh the new laws of German

750
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:42,038
uh implies this uh protection of your

751
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,638
own Market and my question is and

752
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:47,319
considering that most of the a lot of

753
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:49,359
the product that is um medicinal

754
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:53,960
cannabis that is produced in Portugal

755
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:58,638
goes to Germany uh how come in this

756
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:03,798
European Union free um C culation of

757
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:06,359
goods uh how come Germany can close um

758
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:09,440
its borders and protect

759
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:12,479
themselves because I think it's the

760
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,519
opposite uh idea that we have of the

761
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,759
European Union that's a very good

762
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,038
question very good point it's not solved

763
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:20,759
yet because there are two different

764
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,480
regimes we have the EU law and we have

765
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:24,200
the single convention and medical

766
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,480
cannabis is traded according to the

767
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,840
rules of the single convention and these

768
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,558
are overly or superseding uh the uh the

769
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:36,398
principle of the free movement of of

770
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:41,038
goods uh this is a conflict and maybe it

771
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:43,759
if someone starts to uh to uh appeal

772
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,599
against these rules uh maybe he will be

773
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,720
successful if you take it to court it's

774
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:50,439
a good

775
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,000
question we have to see I'm going to

776
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,639
translate that for the Americans in the

777
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,240
audience what you basically have is the

778
00:33:55,638 --> 00:34:03,158
same situation here that we have there

779
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,399
it's federally illegal by EU standards

780
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:08,919
so if the the member states if Germany

781
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,358
as a member state of the EU passes the

782
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,239
law for the benefit of its citizens they

783
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,000
can grow they can do whatever they want

784
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,918
in within the borders of Germany that

785
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,960
where the law gets broken is when the

786
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,118
when it's Crossing Borders when the EU

787
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,358
law is broken is when it's Crossing

788
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,760
Borders so you have this conflict

789
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,639
between the the oversight of the Fed

790
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,320
heads of the EU and what's going on at

791
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,559
the state level or the member state

792
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,639
level and so it's not a freely tradable

793
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,279
commodity medical cannabis it's highly

794
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,200
regulated it's according to the single

795
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,320
convention and you have to comply with

796
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,319
the single convention rules

797
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,759
first there was another question back

798
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,879
there yes hi Jason Shard uh founder of

799
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,879
Pat Global and modern extractor I've got

800
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,719
a bit of a two-tiered question for Kai

801
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,598
um from everything I've read regarding

802
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:01,919
medical cannabis and the new changing of

803
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,440
the cannabis laws in Germany it seems

804
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,320
like it's really opening the doors for

805
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,000
flow but uh beyond that what are the uh

806
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,838
what are the options for creating

807
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
consumer packaged Goods finished

808
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:17,078
products uh Vapes and any of that kind

809
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,519
of stuff and then also how do you

810
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,960
fulfill um is it going to be possible to

811
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,400
fulfill that from within the EU and

812
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,199
outside of Germany eventually in your

813
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,200
opinion yeah you have to comply with the

814
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:35,039
monogra S monographies in Place which is

815
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:37,319
for dried flowers and for um extract and

816
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,559
if you if these if your products comply

817
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:44,240
with these uh monographs you are fine

818
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:46,440
you can sell it but we won't see um uh

819
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,879
medical weaping devices they are not

820
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,800
there yet no one has an authorization

821
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,519
yet for the European market uh but

822
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,440
companies are working on that so yeah

823
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:01,159
and we would need to have more and new

824
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,318
and modern monographies for for for new

825
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:06,440
products which would have to be drafted

826
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:08,639
and you yeah the industry should take

827
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,240
care of that what I predict is that

828
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,480
you'll see um kind of like the social

829
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:17,358
club model here which I know they're not

830
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,159
the same but what happened is cannabis

831
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:23,559
is not legal here but you have these

832
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,399
quote unquote private clubs and they're

833
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,799
not supposed to be selling cannabis but

834
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,880
they all do because it becomes an enfor

835
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,839
ment issue and Kai's talking about the

836
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,599
government's already complaining oh

837
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,920
we've got to go through 100,000 uh they

838
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,480
aren't going to fund enforcement that's

839
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,800
the general rule of what happens is the

840
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,480
law gets passed and then they don't have

841
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,560
they don't consider or they don't think

842
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,800
about we're going to need to actually

843
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:49,358
put some money in budgets for

844
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,280
enforcement so then you're just going to

845
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,000
have people flouting the law which means

846
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,200
then you're going to have people putting

847
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,440
the flower in branded packages and it's

848
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,919
not going to be allowed but they're

849
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,800
going to do it anyway that's my

850
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,559
prediction oh maybe Kai you can tell a

851
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,960
little bit about the products available

852
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:10,480
in the Social Clubs and in the pillar

853
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,440
to uh yeah in Social Clubs it's only uh

854
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,960
flowers and uh resin no extracts

855
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,159
solventless extracts sorry solventless

856
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,679
solventless extracts solventless

857
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:26,920
extract yeah they are

858
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:30,559
forbidden and no Edibles of course uh

859
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,240
but uh life was in so if it's with

860
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:38,679
pressure and no no solvent it's it's

861
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:43,039
okay and um in the model project uh they

862
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:46,118
will try to uh um uh that the Edibles

863
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:48,039
will be possible uh under strict um uh

864
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,838
evaluation uh if that is really as

865
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:54,199
harmful as they expect to be it now it

866
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:55,838
is not but yeah they ads will come there

867
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:57,519
yeah so in the second pillar there is

868
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,199
some potential for more commercial

869
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,639
products because that's the focus of the

870
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:06,358
pillar so um our time is over let's give

871
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,440
a warm Applause uh to the

872
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:11,159
