1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:30,410
From the beginning

2
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:43,200
[Music] So I think for ICBC, what you can expect

3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,690
to see at a show like this is a good connection

4
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,509
between distribution, packaging, um, I want to say

5
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,939
regulations, compliance, retail, wholesale...

6
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:56,439
It's great to have

7
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,289
all of these people all in one room and all in one space so you can kind

8
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,400
of connect the dots and figure out how your business can really excel within the industry.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,840
[Music]

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:19,400
Really, what I love about this show is the interconnections between businesses

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,200
to businesses having meaningful conversations and relationships, uh, to figure out what's

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,670
going on in the industry. Whether it be in Germany or whether it be an entire EU or from

13
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,460
different countries altogether, different continents altogether. I've had great discussions

14
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:39,000
here. I've learned a lot here. This is the kind of stuff that I come to ICBC for. So,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
having a

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,368
great time with it. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to exhibit at a show like

17
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:51,900
this - do it. Don't even second guess it. It's a great connection point.

18
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,390
[Music]

19
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,750
It has been so great to come to ICBC.

20
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,450
What an incredible networking opportunity. I have met fantastic,

21
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,629
smart, successful people from all over the world. And some of them I'm really keen to

22
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:18,840
want to work with.

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,229
[Music]

24
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:29,619
[Music]

25
00:02:29,620 --> 00:03:11,430
The one thing that we know is for sure, is we love you.

26
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:36,719
Thank you, everybody! DJ Goran in the house taking you out y'all!
