1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,299
what what we do just look quickly

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,910
because it's not so much about me but

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:08,230
about about these guys just as much as

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,070
we produce these little humidification

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,809
pouches that solve a very velop problem

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,390
in the industry which is evaporation so

7
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:18,428
if you have flour and it's too dry if

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,810
you lose a lot of its potency because

9
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:21,639
the terpenes would evaporate with the

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:23,108
water that's leaving the plant so and

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,519
also when you sell flour that's too dry

12
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:28,150
you lose money because it's you know

13
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:30,549
it's salt by weight and when it's too

14
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,920
moist you might lose everything to mold

15
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,500
which is equally bad so our product will

16
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,780
keep it within that specific range if

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,558
you believe ASTM at 65 to 55 percent

18
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,270
relative humidity but and it's all

19
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:44,948
natural so if you want to talk to me

20
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,680
about it we have a booth out there so

21
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:49,869
that's it about me but what it

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,539
interestingly is a small company so we

23
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:55,839
have made up like 30 people in

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,640
Minneapolis and Minnesota but we sell on

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,710
a global level and of course this would

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,000
not be possible just for us on our own

27
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,180
and so we rely on a big myriad of

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,170
partnerships as do these guys here so

29
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,979
let me just give you a quick

30
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,689
introduction here to our panel so let's

31
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:15,519
ladies first when we start with the one

32
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:17,798
that has the longest commute flood of

33
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,209
Salomon she's the CEO know your managing

34
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,100
director that's the official title for

35
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:23,798
little green farms out of Perth

36
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:26,769
Australia and remember when I met you

37
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,649
the first time roughly a year ago you

38
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:32,679
still claim to be the only local

39
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:35,739
producer for cannabis in astros that's

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,360
still bill the case you vet sure is so

41
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:39,219
can you give a little introduction about

42
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,828
you and your company thanks Vinnie

43
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:43,298
absolutely um hello thank you for having

44
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:46,599
me and thank you for being here

45
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,770
my name is fleeta and yes the perks are

46
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,509
coming from Australia

47
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:51,968
apparently everybody feels sorry for me

48
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,688
so I get to go first

49
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:58,599
look it's been a remarkable ride and

50
00:01:55,688 --> 00:02:00,728
journey for a little green farmer the

51
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:04,000
Australian market opened up towards the

52
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:06,670
end of 2016 and so a couple of years on

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,889
here we are we are the first and the

54
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,590
only producer in Australia to be

55
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,279
actually producing manufacturing and

56
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:18,110
then providing a

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,759
annoyed medicine for patient youth so we

58
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,650
don't know we're probably a good year

59
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,609
ahead of the rest of the Australian

60
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,260
companies so we need to move forward we

61
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,420
are actually relocating our head office

62
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:31,219
to Europe for the purpose of actually

63
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:34,549
exporting our products now into the

64
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:36,318
German market because as we've heard the

65
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,180
demand is really high particularly in

66
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,568
Europe and so we have a unique

67
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,270
opportunity in Australia to to provide

68
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:46,939
those EU G&amp;P manufactured products the

69
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,320
into Europe but to do that you know it

70
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,930
is a long way from home and we need

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,349
strategic partnerships so moving forward

72
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:57,250
our goal as we move into into Europe is

73
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,120
about strategies and those relationships

74
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,180
all right thank you for that

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,759
so next young lady on the panel Alison

76
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,379
she's a founder CEO of cannabis at work

77
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,289
and the name gives it away a little bit

78
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,939
urine HR expert you actually ventured

79
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,459
from the HR industry into the cannabis

80
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:15,229
space can you just tell us a little bit

81
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,670
about the challenges that you see in

82
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:20,268
that and that's in that field

83
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:23,030
absolutely so in Canada which is where

84
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:25,730
we operate predominantly right now a

85
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,769
cannabis at work helps cannabis

86
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:30,018
companies with recruitment and

87
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,269
headhunting so finding cannabis staff

88
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,879
for their facilities or their business

89
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,519
as well as providing other HR consulting

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,079
services to growing businesses and as

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,620
they need to develop out those programs

92
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:44,239
so what we see in in Canada is you know

93
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,879
we have the good fortune of very much

94
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,500
being a strategic partner to our clients

95
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,979
and and the people in the industry as

96
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,139
they look for very specialized talent

97
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:56,179
for their facilities and cultivation

98
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:59,298
operations as well as some of the other

99
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,489
ancillary businesses in this space and

100
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,530
so it's it's been a really great

101
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,539
opportunity we we've been in the

102
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,669
Canadian market for almost four years so

103
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:09,379
we've really grown up with with a lot of

104
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,939
the momentum that we've seen over the

105
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:13,729
last while and have the opportunity

106
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:15,469
provide a lot of insight to new

107
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:16,969
companies entering the space about what

108
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:19,459
they need in terms of some of this the

109
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,660
technical skill sets of their employees

110
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,209
and how that all fits into the

111
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,430
regulatory environment in Canada what we

112
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,049
see in Canada with with the growth of

113
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,939
our recreational market

114
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:34,220
is such an incredibly fast-paced market

115
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:38,478
such fast growth in these organizations

116
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:41,750
and so are one of our major strengths is

117
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,848
to take some of the stress off of

118
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,639
somebody who might be in the process of

119
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:48,399
getting their license in Canada and pair

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,590
that with the large database of

121
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,870
qualified cannabis employees that we

122
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,899
have and make some of those matches

123
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,870
occur and some of that pairing up so

124
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:02,629
I'll leave it there for now all right

125
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,990
thank you know from left to right we

126
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,769
have Jonas or Jonas Jonas Coleman from

127
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,689
Switzerland

128
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:11,060
so it's a Jonas because it's all English

129
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,310
now founder and CEO of Riddick Anne

130
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,009
which is funny enough so I remembered so

131
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,240
I was trying to research on your project

132
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,150
really kind of didn't funny things I

133
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,680
wrote an email said what's up what's all

134
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:23,120
this about so can you shed a little bit

135
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,009
light because you actually presented it

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,280
here at ICBC right that's the Brad do

137
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:31,218
you thing yes exactly really can is a

138
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:34,369
new company we are a strategic partner

139
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:36,439
for cannabis companies on our own we

140
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,689
sure have also strategic partnerships

141
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:42,439
the most important I guess is the life

142
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:45,500
science University of crock enabling us

143
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:48,259
to to offer services to cannabis

144
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,199
companies who seek possibilities to

145
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:54,278
either back their existing products who

146
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,360
have credible and independently created

147
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:58,759
information on a science really

148
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:04,370
scientific and statistically significant

149
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:08,778
ones or who seek to develop new product

150
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:12,860
in to to further their business within

151
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:14,810
the cannabis industry this we back up on

152
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,650
top with our own film crew which is

153
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,990
there to document the efforts that our

154
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:23,179
clients are doing within those research

155
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,269
and development networks and we co-own

156
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,000
the social media networks of high life

157
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:32,060
media which have a concluded reach of

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,750
around 25 million followers so all in

159
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:38,930
all really can is for the companies out

160
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,550
there a possibility to conduct research

161
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,079
and development combined

162
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:47,449
with content production and publication

163
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:51,800
possibilities in really strong networks

164
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:55,279
in order basically to develop and

165
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:59,949
execute complex tragedies that will lead

166
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:03,769
to clearly unique and long-lasting

167
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:06,800
competitive advantages for them so

168
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:10,039
really can took quite a long preparation

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,379
phase for sure we finally after one and

170
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,040
a half years of pushing and fighting we

171
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:20,209
got to sign the cooperation contract

172
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,160
that allows us to to have that business

173
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:28,149
model and provide that business model to

174
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:31,820
you all and because of that long ongoing

175
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:34,000
fight and since it just happened lately

176
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:37,550
that I was allowed to sign that contract

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,350
we decided to launch completely really

178
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,710
can hear at the ICBC and so that's why

179
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,060
also in your play in your primary

180
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:49,359
clarifications you didn't find a lot

181
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,560
that was also on purpose because we

182
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,750
wanted to really like do it right and

183
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,199
like provide all information in the good

184
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:03,740
quality at the right time we considered

185
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,560
ICBC to be a perfect situation to do so

186
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,210
that's also why I'm clearly lucky to be

187
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,139
here and have the possibility to sit on

188
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:14,419

distributor but also importer for

192
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,910
medical cannabis and beyond everything

193
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,800

194
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,710

00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:32,419
introduce yourself please thanks mm so

197
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,870
yeah elite healthcare distribution is a

198
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,949
important distribution business for

199
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,990
pharmaceuticals for unlicensed medicines

200
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,060
in the UK they were also looking to

201
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,310
operate across Europe so we've got

202
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,589
publications underway for the UK market

203
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,179
right now and soon be expanding to

204
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,490
Germany and Denmark and other countries

205
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:51,709
building up our sales force so the

206
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,779
partnerships for us are extremely

207
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,970
important in that regard

208
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,370
we've got doing distribution for 11

209
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,649
years the relationship between supplier

210
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,870
and distributor is crucial to managing

211
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,299
the market I think in the digital age a

212
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,250
lot of brands and I want to go direct to

213
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,809
the consumer to understand whether you

214
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,970
want to own the consumers in the markets

215
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,379
at the same time you know you need boots

216
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,600
from the ground to help manage that so

217
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,129
that's one thing would be doing the

218
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,920
other another business that we are

219
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:20,950
exhibiting here with esto farm is a

220
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,870
consulting and brokering so again you

221
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,850
know there's a wide network of producers

222
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,919
out there that are all looking access to

223
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,529
these markets we had them to understand

224
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,110
compliance around genetics their product

225
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:34,990
import approvals how finding compliant

226
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,310
distributors understanding what types of

227
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,649
products they can put at the market and

228
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,689
how to do it so again the partnerships

229
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,220
are extremely important there alright

230
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,820
thank you and last but not least we have

231
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,950

232
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,690
founder CEO of I got to Soviet not to

233
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,170
mistake me the Soviet Union I hope your

234
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,000
company last longer than this one so the

235
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,500
you're not only publisher of well

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
renowned publications that we have here

237
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,100
in Germany and Eastern Europe but you're

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,139
brilliant icon in the industry and for

239
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,820
over 20 years I guess right so could you

240
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:08,350
quickly introduce yourself please

241
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:12,820
yeah thank you for our introduction and

242
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,670
yes Agency Soviet is our name don't

243
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,629
don't be scared it's a Russian word

244
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:23,799
translated it means the advice so

245
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:27,870
nothing that serious and when the Soviet

246
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:31,838
Union disappeared from this planet they

247
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,419
had not proclaimed they want to have the

248
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,680
copyrights about Soviet so we jumped in

249
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:42,819
the game and we grabbed it what one of

250
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:45,759
the best investments in my life we

251
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,610
started with very simple thing 20 years

252
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:52,259
ago with publishing media with multiple

253
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,970
supplying information about cannabis

254
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,879
because we at this time we could not

255
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,600
think about dealing with medicinal

256
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,169
cannabis

257
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,750
there was just no knowledge and Suge's

258
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:05,679
through this media you can imagine us

259
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,769
who

260
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,709
90 years of media producing we have of

261
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:15,819
course a very very very lot of contacts

262
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:17,889
and sources of information and I'm

263
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:23,080
really very crouched that through the

264
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:25,509
many years we keep very far ahead when

265
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,070
something new happens in this market we

266
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:33,519
know it first this is really one of our

267
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:36,490
benefits and then the next 20 years I

268
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,679
will make it short because we always

269
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:44,110
have tried to figure out what is

270
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:45,939
possible to to do already legally with

271
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,550
cannabis so we found it a lot of

272
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,790
companies and we started a lot of

273
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:53,649
projects many of them failed also about

274
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:57,519
failing in projects and how to deal with

275
00:11:53,649 --> 00:12:00,789
it somebody should talk one day but

276
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,278
globally in this moment we are seven

277
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:05,439
different companies in this moment of

278
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:09,850
course most important companies of a

279
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,040
distribution of CPG products in Germany

280
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,089
and over Europe and I can support a

281
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:19,929
support you words totally and I want

282
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:20,459
just to add one strategic advice from my

283
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:26,019
side

284
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:30,088
whatever whatever business kind it was

285
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:33,549
it was finally the advice of our lawyers

286
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:37,420
who really made us doing it so please

287
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:39,699
take really all those regulations those

288
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:41,889
which has to do with cannabis and also

289
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,890
those which don't have to do as cannabis

290
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:47,259
serious and try to follow them otherwise

291
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:49,240
no business as possible and I told it

292
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:52,720
two weeks ago in Barcelona on the

293
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:57,220
similar stage first I try to figure out

294
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,980
if my partner can explain me his legal

295
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,490
situation with his product on this

296
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,700
market and then the next question I have

297
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,649
to to my potential partner and do we

298
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,220
have also a lawyer who proves your

299
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:14,110
theory and then we can talk about each

300
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,899
kind of

301
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,669
very interesting projects can we give

302
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,799
Queen Hanson who has a good lawyer here

303
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:22,029
on stage everybody you have a good

304
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,789
lawyer we have a very good lawyer you

305
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:26,860
also have good lawyers okay very good

306
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:28,179
so it's thank you thank you Amy for this

307
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,009
quick start because we had to talk about

308
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:31,569
strategic alliances and when we have

309
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,419
heard it sorry I didn't want to jump

310
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,129
over you yeah because I think his advice

311
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:39,729
truly is a very good one because

312
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:41,379
compliance for companies that are in the

313
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,220
market that used to be suppressed for

314
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:48,370
decades they must make a stand in order

315
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,790
to make this industry survive and thrive

316
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,629
like because the backbone that our

317
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:57,250
industry definitely needs is scientific

318
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:00,070
information credible information

319
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:03,039
resulting in quality products that on

320
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,379
both people can rely on because only on

321
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,439
those means I think we can really

322
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:11,500
reframe that public perception in a way

323
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,990
so we all have a future and connecting

324
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,490
to this his advice truly was right but

325
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:20,799
it was just considered as far as I see

326
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,899
on to the now because compliance always

327
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,259
is a matter of the now what do I got to

328
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:28,480
do to not be closed down tomorrow but

329
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:30,700
that isn't the whole picture because the

330
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,029
whole picture is that there is also a

331
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,780
after tomorrow and the following week or

332
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:39,639
the following year and basically so with

333
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,679
the strategic partnerships I mean

334
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,799
strategy what is strategy for companies

335
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,919
it says didn't what Drucker one of the

336
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,000
good company strategists he said it's

337
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,370
doing the right thing

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,240
Porter said it's using the capacities

339
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,279
that are available in order to create

340
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,240
long-lasting sustainable and unique

341
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,309
competitive advantages so I think the

342
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,610
now needs to be set you have a stable

343
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:08,649
base but the future always needs to be

344
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,009
considered it's a bit like playing check

345
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:14,049
if you just think about your next step

346
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:18,279
you may be run into problems that you

347
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:20,919
didn't see ahead so try always to focus

348
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,589
a couple steps ahead try to prepare them

349
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:26,740
to not suddenly get stuck and always be

350
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,879
aware that I mean there's a lot of money

351
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,680
in our endless

352
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,779
three but I always tend to say that

353
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,759
money is never fun because specially if

354
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,079
you have more businesses or different

355
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,189
departments in your business or

356
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,639
whatsoever

357
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,830
as soon as you run into one issue it

358
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,629
will cease the growth of everything

359
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,300
because first of all you need to take

360
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:49,509
you need to take care of that problem so

361
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:52,899
I think working hassle-free in good

362
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:55,809
working synergetic corporations enabling

363
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,740
unix tragedies that is the way to go and

364
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:01,569
that would be also my advice to milk in

365
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,310
terms of tragedies disorder to say sorry

366
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,629
on the legislation ace and you know

367
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:11,079
often this stuff is changeable

368
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:14,019
and and it's written to provide

369
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,560
structure to your market and we find

370
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:21,610
this in both in UK and it's like

371
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,809
Australia and if you're willing to put

372
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,300
the effort into reading it and

373
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:27,729
understanding us thoroughly and you'll

374
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:29,709
find that there are holes and gaps and

375
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,879
opportunities I think that's a big thing

376
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,160
and when you have the rights for the

377
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,019
partners and it can help you navigate

378
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,449
that and help you find the opportunities

379
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,789
especially in a growing market like this

380
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,040
early stage you know that's where where

381
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:44,409
you make the most money is Indonesia

382
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:46,569
opportunities highest margin not kind of

383
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,429
thing so it's finding good partners to

384
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,950
help you with that process we've done it

385
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:54,129
for a couple of different people and we

386
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:56,259
had a producer in Australia that's gonna

387
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:58,899
be exporting flour they didn't think

388
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,809
they were allowed to export flour until

389
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,100
I read the recognitions and find a

390
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:04,149
loophole and they asked the question a

391
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,730
couple of times and got a positive

392
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,319
response you know they weren't even

393
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,640
considering the pre so the question is

394
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,338
how do we find how do you find good

395
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,259
partners then so but I think there's an

396
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:15,639
important point here too that one of the

397
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:18,068
strategic partners needs to be the

398
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,259
regulator like in Canada Health Canada

399
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:22,588
is the government ministry that oversees

400
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:24,699
cannabis production and distribution and

401
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:27,099
they're learning all this for the first

402
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,860
time as well and so I think it's been

403
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:32,289
really important to see companies be

404
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:34,899
successful when they build bridges to

405
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:36,869
the regulator and they use that as one

406
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,670
of the partnerships that they leverage

407
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:40,839
yeah I would say people tend to

408
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,650
[Music]

409
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:46,269
sort of asked what's your shy away from

410
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,920
burgers but like in my experience most

411
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:49,720
of them are open to it if you approach

412
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,920
it in the right way you engage them in

413
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,140
the right way and you have the right

414
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,970
mindset protect your own compliance and

415
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,310
regulation they will work with you

416
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,180
hundred percent so would you approach

417
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:02,919
regulators yourself do you have you know

418
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,720
interest groups that you you would cater

419
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,250
to so what's what's the because dealing

420
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,339
with ready to let regulators I think we

421
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,990
all agree is very important so what's a

422
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:15,220
good strategy actually to to tackle that

423
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,539
maybe what's you say yeah look we we

424
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,799
learnt a little bit later in the pace

425
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,539
that having relationship with the

426
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,909
government bodies and the politicians is

427
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:23,920
definitely the way to go you just have

428
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,420
to you have to it's I mean the patients

429
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,460
are the biggest advocates and have the

430
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:32,529
biggest voice of a lot there is nothing

431
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:36,519
more powerful than patience however when

432
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:38,170
we're navigating such a complex a new

433
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,759
industry we definitely need to be

434
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,310
lobbying all the time to our governments

435
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,410
one of our strategic partners is it's

436
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,029
exactly that is the lobbyists firm and

437
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,279
we've got a wonderful relationship with

438
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:50,410
them but I think what makes that so

439
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,269
strong is that we actually both share a

440
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,240
vision and you kind of like any

441
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:57,190
strategic partnership any alliance it

442
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,099
will fail unless you have a joint just

443
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,930
that the shared vision without that you

444
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:04,869
you sort of go off track a little bit

445
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,910
and you need to be able to have Saluki

446
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:08,259
eyes or your metrics and you need to be

447
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,360
able to communicate with them regularly

448
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,039
and keep coming back to that end vision

449
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,949
and the goals that you shared to get an

450
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,180
objective in the first place I think

451
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,100
it's absolutely right what you're saying

452
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,680
the the government the institution and

453
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:22,839
to work closely together with them is a

454
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,840
crucial point to have a sustainable

455
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,629
survival however I think that

456
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,240
communication basically happens at the

457
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:35,320
recipient so the information you provide

458
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:39,640
must fit the reality the expectations of

459
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:41,950
those independent bodies which are in

460
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,830
that case the governmental institutions

461
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,720
so usually as we have realized bringing

462
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:49,389
in a third party which is on the same

463
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,029
level such as in our case the University

464
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,610
Life Science University of procreating

465
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:56,710
is just statistically significant and

466
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:59,409
and information with a high credibility

467
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,190
can get you actually in collaboration

468
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:06,100
with those state bodies a long long long

469
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:09,100
way and their that long long long way

470
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:11,199
basically that is then that what you'll

471
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:13,719
be able to go that long way that is then

472
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,569
that unique competitive advantage

473
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,670
because you can really you can lay back

474
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:21,129
because you can you know you're safe

475
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,140
which means you can focus on actually

476
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,210
the work in your market and not

477
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,880
constantly try to clean up behind

478
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,610
yourself in order to not suddenly be

479
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,179
pushed out of the game I mean you want

480
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:36,159
to add to this yeah I mean in a really

481
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,830
comfortable situation because exactly

482
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,730
part in fact that we were doing the

483
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:45,189
newspapers now for nearly 20 years and

484
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,839
the fact that this newspaper is read by

485
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:51,640
a lot people in the Ministry of Health

486
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:54,609
and whoever's in in this game of course

487
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,130
we always talking with exactly those

488
00:20:54,609 --> 00:21:01,298
people sometimes more friendly sometimes

489
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:04,330
not that much but in fact whenever we

490
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:07,119
publish something in our newspaper we we

491
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:09,250
see some weeks later a respond something

492
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,819
somebody has read something and this is

493
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:16,179
even really super nice situation still

494
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:18,460
we have to keep like diplomatic and we

495
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,640
have to deal also with the Ministry of

496
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,769
Health still and of course it's a key

497
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,100
question don't be shy please go to you

498
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:30,460
too no responsibility they won't bite

499
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:32,019
you there are normal people then they

500
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:36,100
have to explain you the regulation

501
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:39,849
exactly we are living in a very very

502
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:41,949
transparent stage and in this case ask

503
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:44,589
them sometimes they even like to talk

504
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,019
about their work and there's always

505
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:48,490
going to be next election so so they're

506
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:52,779
very interested in what public opinion

507
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,940
might be maybe all right so we heard a

508
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:57,480
lot about you know choosing the right

509
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:01,029
partners what type of partners we have

510
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,669
what but how do you I'm really

511
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:05,799
interested in is what is if you happen

512
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:08,259
to have a partnership that doesn't work

513
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,329
you know this is what I found from my

514
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:13,180
experiences where'd you learn most

515
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,740
basically is from something that didn't

516
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,180
work out and then you analyze it and

517
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,099
then you have a chance to actually make

518
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,560
it better is there anything what what do

519
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:23,709
you guys want to add to this maybe I

520
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:27,190
think you know to be to be entrepreneur

521
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,500
it means to have a great endurance it

522
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,990
means also sometimes to be patience but

523
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,960
you should never mistake endurance with

524
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,519
patients because patience implies to be

525
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,210
waiting for the wrong thing

526
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:43,230
endurance means keeping to try on to do

527
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,670
something for the right thing so a

528
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,650
Japanese crowd says it's better to turn

529
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:52,990
around half weight and staying on the

530
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:57,220
wrong track and I think to be able to to

531
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:58,930
to define at some point when you are on

532
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,819
the wrong track which is the question

533
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,720
we're talking about here you need to

534
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:07,299
have a really good understanding of the

535
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,210
goal where you go into and you need to

536
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,339
put milestones in the way to be able to

537
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,850
measure the development that you take

538
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:19,449
towards there unless you do that you

539
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:22,869
won't be able to measure your your way

540
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:25,870
and yes I mean I think everyone who is

541
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:29,759
here know has a bit some some experience

542
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:32,979
with things that will go in sideways so

543
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,589
once you realize that I mean it can be

544
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,710
painful it usually is always painful

545
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:39,220
actually but um I think you will get

546
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,620
over it

547
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,829
and that is then we're really that

548
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:47,769
endurance comes in that you need to have

549
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:51,220
you know to get back up wipe off the

550
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:53,950
dust kinda and keep going find a better

551
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,809
partner they surely are out there and

552
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,549
somebody may be an example like

553
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,799
something that's specific because I

554
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:01,480
agree with you but it's like general do

555
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:04,529
we have something we can actually touch

556
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,870
any you know share something with you

557
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:10,629
this is it's the most integral and

558
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:12,250
important relationship strategic

559
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,990
alliance that this business has that

560
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,960
little green farmer has and that is with

561
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,940
our manufacturer now to get speed to

562
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,059
market and to get to where we are today

563
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,440
and to be the leader in Australia

564
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,359
we did that through a strategic

565
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,180
partnership with one of the few GMP

566
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,939
opiate manufacturers and its EU

567
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,490
certified and we were able to quickly

568
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,930
get to where we wanted to because of

569
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,509
that certification

570
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:46,180
now we our conversations derail all the

571
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:49,390
time because I have a cultivation

572
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,070
company we've also got this one business

573
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,540
unit and on the flip side we also have

574
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:54,250
the manufacturing in the pharmaceutical

575
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,730
so we've got multiple business units

576
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:00,309
there's always going to be disconnecting

577
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,900
between and sometimes we absolutely fly

578
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:04,480
off the handle at each other because we

579
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,610
don't agree and sometimes we think wow

580
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,529
what what would happen here if we if we

581
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:12,149
walked away from each other what would

582
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:14,799
happen but you know what it never will

583
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,960
because we're so tight because we both

584
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,700
share a vision and the moment that the

585
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,850
two companies start to have this little

586
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,650
OG bhaji we get back on track we

587
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:26,349
determine what those milestones and

588
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,840
those goals are we determine we get back

589
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:31,000
and say why are we actually here what is

590
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,769
our purpose and then we manage to get

591
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,900
through it and then we get back on and I

592
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:36,940
think that that's communication and so

593
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,490
if we're not communicating all the time

594
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,170
and also enjoying those the little wins

595
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,849
that we have then you know that's where

596
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,289
it completely can be derailed and I

597
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,799
think that that was a really important

598
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,000
lesson

599
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,649
certainly that we've learned and

600
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,690
hopefully you can take away from as well

601
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:52,690
I would also say additionally to that

602
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,430
like that in every business if you work

603
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,769
really with people who are highly

604
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:59,470
motivated which will be a key factor to

605
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:02,289
your success it is possible to get into

606
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:04,089
exactly such situations which is nothing

607
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:07,990
bad which you should not be afraid of

608
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:10,240
it's just a function or a result of that

609
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:12,759
high motivation that everyone brings in

610
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,410
who sometimes just have a different

611
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,619
understanding that needs to be brought

612
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,330
in one point so that let's say living

613
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:22,719
discussion that you could have in such a

614
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:25,349
situation it's really nothing bad

615
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,660
despite the fact that they could have

616
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:30,939
like a bad appearance in the first place

617
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,330
just try to get over it stick to your

618
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,308
people and you know don't be afraid of

619
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:39,408
little bumps in a road

620
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:43,099
yeah I think you know from my experience

621
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:45,528
in the distribution sense and the shared

622
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:47,658
vision and Nicole you know they need to

623
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:49,898
be aligned and setting milestones it's

624
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:52,879
extremely important for evaluating

625
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:54,648
everyone's performance and as you move

626
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:57,349
forward and you know you have to be

627
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:59,599
realistic markets changed and shift you

628
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,490
know the medical cannabis market is very

629
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,398
early doors there's a lot of work that

630
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:07,460
goes into driving prescriptions you know

631
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,319
the CBD market is changeable you know it

632
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,120
shifts around I think the important

633
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:12,798
thing is to have a relationship between

634
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,719
the two the communication is important

635
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,519
to understand where things are going and

636
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,110
the fact you're you're putting they're

637
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,970
working that you're still striving to

638
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:21,138
achieve it goes that's what sort of

639
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,778
keeps everybody aligned in that

640
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:25,250
relationship and that includes having

641
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:31,069
the right people on board so so Ellis

642
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:35,028
mister like right way of finding people

643
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:36,829
that have these you know talents to

644
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,058
secure them for your company in order to

645
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:41,599
have these discussions with your

646
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:43,278
potential partners a right way to hire

647
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,138
the right people essentially yeah that's

648
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,329
probably hiring your agency right but

649
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:48,648
it's what do you do so how do you first

650
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:51,168
for me would be how do I choose the

651
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:53,000
right partner like HR partner and what's

652
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,528
I mean what should we look at in the

653
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,788
discussion with the potential partner

654
00:27:54,528 --> 00:28:00,648
like yourself yeah so I think that you

655
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:03,048
know from my personal perspective when

656
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:05,599
we're working with people in the

657
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:07,788
industry is we want there to be an

658
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,558
alignment around you know our goals and

659
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:11,388
and have the confidence that we're gonna

660
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:13,668
add value to their process if we're the

661
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:15,500
service provider I think more broadly I

662
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:17,210
think it also comes down to finding

663
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,740
people that you like and that you can

664
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,480
communicate with and that you do have a

665
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,058
sense of trust even early in that

666
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,058
relationship you know on on the hiring

667
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:29,178
side I think the challenge with with

668
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:33,408
cannabis that we see in Canada is that

669
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:35,570
there are specialized skill sets like to

670
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:38,450
find somebody who has the background

671
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:41,058
that they understand cannabis but can

672
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:44,509
also grow that product at commercial

673
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:46,609
scale is a few is a unique skill set

674
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:48,349
there's not that many people in Canada

675
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:49,519
or in this country that have that

676
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:51,649
ability no we

677
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,210
have a lot of what we call black market

678
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,130
or gray market growers that have a ton

679
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,299
of expertise which is important and we

680
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,340
try to bring those people into the

681
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,409
industry that can be challenging at

682
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:02,389
times if they're not a cultural fit with

683
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,370
the regulatory side and so it's really

684
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,440
about finding you know the right people

685
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:09,049
and then I think it's just looking ahead

686
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,529
to what are your strategic objectives

687
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:15,079
like if you want to be a GMP certified

688
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:17,299
facility and operate in the U market

689
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:19,699
then making sure that you're going and

690
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:22,519
finding people who have experience in

691
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,410
GMP from other sectors and and bringing

692
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:25,819
them in so I mean I think there's some

693
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,560
very industry specific things when we're

694
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:29,210
talking about hiring people into the

695
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,909
industry or into organizations I think

696
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,779
the the no rule applies probably

697
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,990
when you're hiring for your own

698
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:37,250
organization of good people but more

699
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,900
broadly you if you're looking at a

700
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,490
service provider or strategic partner I

701
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,750
think how can you add value to each

702
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:46,670
other's world and you know are you

703
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,099
aligned in terms of really being bought

704
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,320
into the cannabis sector I'll expand for

705
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:53,929
just one more moment like when we are

706
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,819
looking to engage with service providers

707
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:59,390
and to support our business and our

708
00:29:55,819 --> 00:30:02,450
business grow for services that we're

709
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:04,430
providing you know we also look for

710
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:07,130
companies that are focused exclusively

711
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:09,799
on cannabis you know a really simple

712
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,960
example is we're producing a large

713
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:14,720
cannabis career festival in Canada in

714
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,400
September and we need a photographer and

715
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,039
videographer to be there to capture

716
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,110
content and there is a company based in

717
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,029
Toronto that is focusing exclusively on

718
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:25,549
this market we pick them we had other

719
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:27,799
choices and other choices that were

720
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:29,539
maybe slightly more cost competitive but

721
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:31,759
we believe in cannabis we believe in

722
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:34,159
this industry and so when we can and we

723
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,000
have the opportunity we pick cannabis

724
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,740
companies first

725
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,349
okay so shared values and shared

726
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,980
objectives is one of the key components

727
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:45,589
and all the partnerships we agree I mean

728
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,960
yes of course I prefer to work with

729
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:52,250
companies which already have experience

730
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:55,039
in cannabis and have the same go to go

731
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:58,099
to regulate it all and make it all

732
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:02,930
accessible and of course we are also

733
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:06,269
running also a travel agency for stoners

734
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:08,759
of course I'm I like to go or as I like

735
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:10,980
to go with with this company and I

736
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:15,240
expect something different than with the

737
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:20,640
normal travel agency well of course yeah

738
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:23,009
it's it's not easy to to deal with with

739
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,780
the negative aspects of course over 20

740
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:31,799
years and for sure mm mm of experiences

741
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:34,649
with which nobody wants to do however I

742
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:37,559
would not sit here if I would not be

743
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,630
master of positive thinking but I think

744
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:44,000
in each kind of business you have really

745
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:47,730
to keep on track and motivate yourself

746
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,720
each day to master the challenges of

747
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:54,750
this day in the end most of the problems

748
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,360
are about money so forget about the

749
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:00,029
money this day we will earn another

750
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:03,990
money which is a lot better than that

751
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:08,039
which we lost yesterday whatever

752
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:11,009
happened we will sort it out in the

753
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,740
future and in this moment it will block

754
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:19,079
you wherever you want to solve the very

755
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:24,559
creepy details why somebody did not what

756
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:28,500
was expected go on it solves itself

757
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,139
however I was I was already talking

758
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:36,000
about a heuristic the lawyer aspect

759
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:38,820
there is still you have to put in trust

760
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,849
in the game without trust no business

761
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:46,319
will happen never and then my personal

762
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:49,799
recommendation yes have a have a big

763
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:53,069
vision where to go and then still you

764
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:55,799
have to find out step wise call it

765
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:59,250
milestones or unique project small

766
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:03,109
projects but how can we dream of of

767
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:06,539
making millions together when we cannot

768
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:09,089
invest 5,000 euro in going to a certain

769
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,129
kind of show or something you know the

770
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:15,179
small things sometimes tell you a lot

771
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,960
about the bigger construction Jamie

772
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,450
Johnson

773
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,808
yeah mayor jumpin to the question the

774
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,610
original question first would I for

775
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:27,918
example work with cannabis companies

776
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:30,959
first it's a clear yes and clear no

777
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,019
because I think the goal is to also

778
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,480
expand the industry that we're working

779
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:39,329
and expanding doesn't work if you only

780
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,649
work with the stuff that you have inside

781
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:45,210
its contradictions I mean is expanding

782
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:48,479
most of all I also want to say that all

783
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:51,538
eyes of the world are directed on

784
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,690
cannabis right now so it is also a good

785
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:57,569
situation to just pull in resources that

786
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:00,119
did not have connections with cannabis

787
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:03,178
before however who build maybe because I

788
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:04,859
said cannabis is a young industry so it

789
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,629
has all the problems of a young industry

790
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:09,118
however the people and the resources

791
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:11,368
that can be found outside the industry

792
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,950
they maybe have a history of a hundred

793
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:16,829
years or more and the professionalism

794
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:19,648
the possibilities and the resources that

795
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:21,539
can be that can be won for your business

796
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:24,989
there they can really make a difference

797
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:27,148
and that is why we went with the other

798
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,219
two companies that I have into the

799
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:31,469
collaboration with the university that

800
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:34,108
was outside the general cannabis

801
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:37,289
industry that is why we offer those

802
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:39,418
research and development services to all

803
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:41,159
the companies out there who want to make

804
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,618
a difference on the base of quality

805
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,230
product and scientific information that

806
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:48,329
was not created within the cannabis

807
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,690
industry but within a highly credible

808
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:54,480
network of which date and can take

809
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,730
profit because they will directly profit

810
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,588
from the credibility that the university

811
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,650
has built up in over a hundred years of

812
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:03,900
existence and so for that reason yes

813
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,818
there can be some shared visions within

814
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,670
the cannabis industry that will make it

815
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:11,460
easier to find a certain plan or a

816
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,200
certain getting together however it

817
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,358
doesn't mean that the resources that

818
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,598
will enable you to execute that plan

819
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,739
will also be just only within the

820
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,390
cannabis industry

821
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:24,239
nothing talking about strategic

822
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:27,269
partnerships I don't think that the

823
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:30,299
approach of tomorrow itself it will

824
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:33,750
solve itself is the right one

825
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,820
I think it's really doing the right

826
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:40,260
thing to get to the point where you want

827
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:42,240
to be and I think that always that

828
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,120
always it's a hard thing to do I know it

829
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:48,199
from from my daily business to do that

830
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,599
split of having one leg in the now

831
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:55,139
taking care of all the issues while

832
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,799
actually preventing all the problems but

833
00:35:55,139 --> 00:36:02,099
at in the future days and I must say

834
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,680
from my own experience a solution you

835
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,309
don't need to like a solution is a

836
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:11,399
solution in some situations only and if

837
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:13,829
you look only on the present moment you

838
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,200
may going to choose things that you like

839
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:18,119
because you don't consider the effects

840
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:22,679
that they will have in the tomorrow or

841
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,929
the week after okay so I agree so let's

842
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:29,190
look at the diffusion so what do you

843
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:30,750
think would be the partnerships that

844
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,210
there will be most important in the

845
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:37,199
future maybe start with you Liam um I

846
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:40,139
think and I often talk about the growth

847
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:43,049
of the cannabis industry and like the

848
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:45,420
tech computer industry and which sort of

849
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,370
grew in phases of complexity and I think

850
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,070
we were in the first phase of this of

851
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:52,079
this industry and I think what's

852
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,720
different from with cannabis is that and

853
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,579
it's effectively going to bleed into

854
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,919
like all of these other existing

855
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:01,079
industries so that's where strategic

856
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,940
partnerships and should come from

857
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,429
outside the industry you should be

858
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,750
looking to take technology that exists

859
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:09,899
in other industries and use it for

860
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:13,019
cannabis to scale it faster and and

861
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,309
ultimately you know the IP and the

862
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,139
knowledge that you develop in your

863
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:18,420
business will be seen to be valuable by

864
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:20,159
bigger players in those other industries

865
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,990
that's where you know at the moment

866
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,329
consolidation is happening within the

867
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:26,250
industry and in four or five years time

868
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:28,590
it'll be happening in two other lots of

869
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,900
other industries so that I think that's

870
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,880
important to note those are the most

871
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,740
opportunities all right thank you if you

872
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,660
add your producers perspective later

873
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:41,279
what would you agree what would you add

874
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:43,649
to that yeah one word which resonates

875
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,160
with me all the time is adaptability

876
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:49,740
and to me you can soar skillset anywhere

877
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:52,619
anyhow as long as they're adaptable so I

878
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:55,049
think we've grown the business based on

879
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:57,089
our own experience we haven't left

880
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,130
necessarily gone and got skill sets from

881
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,050
other countries or bigger brothers which

882
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,289
which some of our competitors have done

883
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:06,150
in fact we can I boast the most amazing

884
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,679
incredible team and they've come from

885
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,380
different backgrounds but what they do

886
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:14,819
bring are their own skill sets and again

887
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:19,230
adaptability Emmy maybe you want to

888
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:21,600
address yes so I think we make the

889
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,429
rights to a strategic decision as three

890
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,159
years ago not to take part in their

891
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:30,869
bidding for medicinal cannabis and sugar

892
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:33,679
last three years the fantastic evolution

893
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:36,269
with CBT products and the strategic

894
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:39,269
decision we made we want wanted to have

895
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:41,489
good branded products for the end

896
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:44,159
consumers and we have Bank on board we

897
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:46,949
have canopy called on on board we have

898
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,139
hem touch really wonderful products and

899
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,669
this is about know about the future we

900
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:53,369
make the decision and this is also

901
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,740
strategic and it's something like what

902
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:57,480
you told it's the cannabis market the

903
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:00,209
medicinal cannabis market in Germany

904
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,599
will be decided by the quality of your

905
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:06,599
cannabis product and we decided stretch

906
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,480
Italy and we closed a part of the deal

907
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,319
exactly under so thanks to ICPC for

908
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,780
organizing this we make a strategic

909
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,230
partnership with our Israeli partner and

910
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,870
we really import cannabis from Israel to

911
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:24,510
Germany and we hope we can serve the

912
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:25,230
First Nations in Germany before

913
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,450
Christmas

914
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:31,349
why because they have the highest

915
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:34,589
density rate on studies on preclinical

916
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:37,610
studies of tough choice of patients of

917
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:41,640
knowledge and this is like the really

918
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:42,420
point which will decide this market in

919
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,279
the future

920
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,039
okay then Ellison and I we close with

921
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,710
Jonas you want to add to to your future

922
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,320
outlook in partnerships in cannabis

923
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:55,920
space I'll just make a comment and

924
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,329
closing from my experience in Canada you

925
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,619
know I think strategic partnerships

926
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:03,359
be very formal strategic relationships

927
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:06,150
to move a certain part of the business

928
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:09,929
forward but I think that my experience

929
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,459
in Canada has been that there's so many

930
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:13,679
strategic partnerships even at an

931
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:16,228
informal level within the industry and

932
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,728
that we all have this common ground

933
00:40:16,228 --> 00:40:20,038
which is that we're all working towards

934
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:21,118
the same goal which is moving forward

935
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,299
medical cannabis and perhaps

936
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,068
recreational cannabis in whatever market

937
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:27,768
were in and so I think that there's a

938
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:29,728
tremendous amount of power in that

939
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:32,218
although there is going to be

940
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:33,958
competition in the market there's at

941
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:35,369
least what we see in Canada a tremendous

942
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:37,108
amount of collaboration even amongst

943
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,358
licensed producers because they sell to

944
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:41,248
patients or they sell to a recreational

945
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,259
market but they also wholesale product

946
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:45,179
to each other and so they have to have

947
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:47,009
relationships with one another while

948
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:49,558
also having a competitive place in the

949
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:52,829
market and so I think that events like

950
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:54,660
this are tremendously important in terms

951
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:56,068
of the opportunity to build

952
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:57,659
relationships with everybody in this

953
00:40:56,068 --> 00:41:03,170
room and so I think that's an important

954
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:05,548
takeaway as well thanks a lot

955
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,079
the question was what the future would

956
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:09,208
look like oh it's going to look like

957
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:11,068
well I can't answer that I don't know in

958
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:13,009
the crystal ball but I can tell you what

959
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:17,190
I would like the future to look like and

960
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:19,159
for me surely it is a future with where

961
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,278
there is a lot of credible information

962
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:25,969
available created by a wide base of

963
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:28,798
companies resulting in many high quality

964
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:32,130
products that are out there where people

965
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:34,440
can rely on because I said this is what

966
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,769
we'll do the reframing of the public

967
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:41,429
perception and preclinical information

968
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:45,328
that Emanuel brought to speech is

969
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:47,278
definitely a very very very important

970
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:49,079
part of it because preclinical

971
00:41:47,278 --> 00:41:51,748
information that we offer over the

972
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,479
university or the creation of such means

973
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:59,368
of such or such information that we

974
00:41:54,478 --> 00:42:02,338
offer it's quite easy and quickly able

975
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:05,880
to be done if you have the right access

976
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:08,308
to it for sure and afterwards the real

977
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,280
clinical information that will then lead

978
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:13,370
to

979
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,560
to bring in products for regulatory

980
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:19,549
procedures to do that

981
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:22,759
I mean clinical trials on animals

982
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:25,789
already or then on humans they always

983
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,090
need to pass the ethical common comities

984
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:31,820
of the particular country it's another

985
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:34,400
state department or state institution

986
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:37,220
that we were talking before about so

987
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,280
those ones they need to be convinced in

988
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:43,069
a very good way and that only works on

989
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,300
quality information preclinical

990
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:48,980
information in that case so I guess in

991
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,470
the future a lot of that information

992
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,780
should be created in order to back

993
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:55,879
existing products and then with time

994
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,340
