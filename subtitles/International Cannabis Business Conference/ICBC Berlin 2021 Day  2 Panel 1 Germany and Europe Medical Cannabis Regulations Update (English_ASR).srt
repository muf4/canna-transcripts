10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,118

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,279
group of people coming together talking

12

it's a pleasure to be here thank you so

00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,199
much

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
do you know the difference between a

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,399
german speaker and

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,640
speaker from the us or the uk

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,160
well the speakers from the us or the uk

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,840
start their speech usually with a joke

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,839
the germans do that with an agenda

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,879
i have skipped the agenda but even worse

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,798
i've skipped a joke

27
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,679
so what i want to do with you this

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,240
morning is to talk about with you to set

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,680
the stage for your discussions today

30
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,199
about the cultivation of cannabis in

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
germany

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,759
which is

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,478
from

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,640
a legal point of view and excuse me i'm

35
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,959
a lawyer a kind of a long history

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,599
it all started

37
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,239
back in 2019

38
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,959
what you definitely know is

39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,478
that the

40
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,199
liberalization

41
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:42,879
of

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,159
cannabis for medicinal purpose in

43
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:49,039
germany has not been caused by a

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,560
thoughtful discussion and a lengthy

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,719
thought process

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,719
it was triggered actually by

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,599
a court decision in 2016 which we heard

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
yesterday

49
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,959
and very quickly the legislator put

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,759
together

51
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,199
some

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,280
legal framework for the cannabis now to

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,959
get the background clear here

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,840
uh before 2017 we had around

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,239
600 to 1000 users of cannabis for

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,800
medicinal purposes patients who have

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,959
received a specific

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,000
exemption from the bee farm which is the

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,199
german fda to use cannabis for their own

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
purposes

61
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,759
for treating their disease

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,000
one of those patients actually started

63
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,039
growing

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,878
for his own purposes and what the

65
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,799
germans are very good in and he received

66
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,919
it immediately is a cease and desist

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
order

68
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,280
so he went to court and in 2016 he

69
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,958
received actually a positive court

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
decision by the highest administrative

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,878
goal in germany that he is allowed to

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
grow his own cannabis

73
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,479
which for the

74
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,039
lawmaker

75
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,959
is really a nightmare now you have 1 000

76
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,318
around 1 000

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:09,120
legalized growers so that's why very

78
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:11,119
quickly in march 2017 the liberalization

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
liberalization of cannabis for medicine

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,080
purposes

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
was established

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,120
with the necessity and that's why i'm

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,280
telling you that that

84
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,000
the

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,560
grow the cultivation of cannabis for

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,919
medicinal purposes needs to be allowed

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,120
as well

88
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,839
under state control according to the

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
1961 u.n single convention which you i

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,039
believe all know

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,599
though the consequence was that

92
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,479
the bay farm established a cannabis

93
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,280
agency which is going to control

94
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,399
the

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
respective

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
cultivation

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
and

98
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,958
the cultivation process started with a

99
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,318
tender process

100
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,640
actually back

101
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:00,158
in 2019 the tender process was ended

102
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,679
where there were two tender processes

103
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,079
with legal hurdles

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,640
i spare you all the details here but

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
last but not least three companies

106
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,719
received

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,560
in altogether 13 licenses

108
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,238
to grow cannabis in germany

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,798
they are

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,798
afria

111
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:26,079
aurora and demicon

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
five licenses for aurora five licenses

113
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,159
for

114
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,000
afria and three licenses for

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,479
dimmicon

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,918
the quantity

117
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,240
in this tender is limited to 10.4 metric

118
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,240
tons

119
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,320
for four years

120
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,159
all together

121
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,319
which means these

122
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,840
three licensees

123
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:55,360
are in a position to produce together

124
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,478
2.6 tons per annum

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
which

126
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,758
is from and i will show you that in a

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
minute

128
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,000
from

129
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
a market point of view

130
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,638
at least that's what most thought are

131
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,319
neglectable

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,879
that's only half the truth and i will

133
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,759
come back to that in a minute

134
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,399
what i would like to focus right now is

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,080
for just for you and for recollection

136
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:26,560
uh is the distribution channel

137
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,478
how currently before really the cannabis

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
cultivated in germany hits the market

139
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,000
cannabis products for medicine purposes

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,519
are imported into germany

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
let's see it from a point of a

142
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,799
cultivator

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,840
let's take a company in canada

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,280
who is cultivating cannabis flowers and

145
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,038
would like to go to the german market

146
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,319
so what do they have to do well they

147
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,199
have to find

148
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,120
an importer besides all the legal

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,560
necessities all the legal documentation

150
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,240
which they need from the canadian

151
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,079
authorities to export to grow and export

152
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,079
they need to have a german importer

153
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,719
the german importer then is going to

154
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,399
apply for the import license

155
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,039
always provided that he has been

156
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,560
properly recognized as a duly licensed

157
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,240
importer for cannabis products in

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,639
germany

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,439
with the consequence that a he has to

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,319
name the country

161
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,038
b

162
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,400
he has to name the exporter the canadian

163
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,599
company

164
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,359
and c

165
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,879
he has to identify the product

166
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
now coming to

167
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,600
the

168
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600
monograph for calabas flowers

169
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,239
the product itself

170
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,560
has to be identified

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,160
the application to the respective

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,598
authorities is company a from canada

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,120
is going to

174
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:58,240
export to germany and we are importing a

175
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,240
product with a thc content let's say of

176
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,038
20

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,598
let's

178
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,399
leave out the cbd percentage

179
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,680
and we call that

180
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,598
charlie watts

181
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,120
in memory

182
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,319
so charlie what's product with 20 20 thc

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,519
is then

184
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,720
uh legalized license to be imported into

185
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,719
germany

186
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,120
the german monograph

187
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,919
which actually

188
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
defines the quality requirements for

189
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,120
that

190
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,639
product for all products but now in

191
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,199
pacific for charlie watts

192
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,199
stipulates that the

193
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,079
differentiation the difference between

194
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,960
the

195
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,279
applied 20 thc content

196
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,839
and what can be imported is limited to

197
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,839
plus minus 10

198
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,439
that means

199
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,279
the product which arrives in germany

200
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,719
charlie watts

201
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,638
can only have 22 percent thc

202
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,000
or 18

203
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,680
all above or below does not fulfill the

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,918
quality requirements under the german

205
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,160
monograph

206
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,000
that is something which cultivators from

207
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
abroad and of course also within the

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,079
european union have to take into

209
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,719
consideration

210
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,279
a very narrow corridor

211
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,680
well i'm not a cannabis grower but

212
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,079
my clients told me that it is difficult

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,840
to achieve it's not a tomato plant as we

214
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,159
all know

215
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,159
so the question is and we discussed that

216
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,400
actually yesterday in one of the panel

217
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,120
discussions

218
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,439
is

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,519
the future in order to meet these

220
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
quality requirements for medicine and

221
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,679
cannabis

222
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:42,080
only be achievable if you do indoor

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,239
or can you actually

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,360
do also greenhouse

225
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,360
and maybe outdoor

226
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,680
from what i've heard so far

227
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
if you want to have a constant quality

228
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,958
for a constant product in this case

229
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
charlie watts you actually need to have

230
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,359
indoor

231
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
growing

232
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,680
indoor cultivation in order to really

233
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,039
reach the same quality

234
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,479
whether this is correct or not i'll

235
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,079
leave it to you

236
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,039
and all the growers who are actually in

237
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,440
the room

238
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,519
uh but that is something which has to be

239
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,160
taken to consideration

240
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,120
currently that's what i'm i'm

241
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,879
actually pointing out with that

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
some of the products which are reaching

243
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,639
the german market

244
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
may not have

245
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,519
for are not fulfilling this

246
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,720
quality requirement

247
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
and the question is what are the

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
consequences well actually it is not

249
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,639
ready for marketing

250
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,480
it cannot be market

251
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,199
however

252
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,440
it is marketed

253
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,320
the authorities currently

254
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,839
are relatively relaxed

255
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
take into consideration that we will

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,839
have more cultivators not only from

257
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,000
abroad and i will come back to that in a

258
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,959
minute but also within the european

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
union

260
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,919
from denmark from from portugal

261
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,959
from greece

262
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,599
the authorities and that's i think an

263
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,439
important message for you will closer

264
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,200
look into the fulfillment of the

265
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
respective quality requirements

266
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,559
so

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,958
coming back to gacp and gmp

268
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,199
we also discussed that yesterday in the

269
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,119
investors forum just for

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,560
a second

271
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,560
there is currently a route

272
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,800
where gacp

273
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,039
grown and cultivated cannabis

274
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,240
is exported into

275
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,240
the european union

276
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,680
the normal route would be that the

277
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,600
respective cultivator receives eugmp

278
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,359
certification

279
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
which for those who are abroad is

280
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,800
difficult to achieve

281
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,120
because it needs an on-site inspection

282
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,078
from the german authorities

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,000
whether the grower the cultivator abroad

284
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,799
is fulfilling this requirement is

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,399
fulfilling eu gmp's

286
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,000
requirements

287
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,078
so there indeed

288
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,600
officers from the

289
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,399
authorities flying to canada to lisotto

290
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,278
to

291
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,159
other

292
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,759
countries outside of the european union

293
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,838
checking on site whether the

294
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,759
requirements are fulfilled

295
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,040
then you get the cultivator gets the

296
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,919
respective approval and is then

297
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,360
allowed to export its product under eu

298
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,360
gmp

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,440
to germany or other european countries

300
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,839
what we have experienced in the last

301
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
couple of

302
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,279
months and you may have seen that also

303
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
in the trade press

304
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,879
is that

305
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,519
cannabis flowers

306
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,958
just gacp processed

307
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,759
cultivated cut packaged shipped

308
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:01,278
has reached the european market

309
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:05,838
it has then been processed here in

310
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,439
europe under eu gmp certification

311
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,360
and then sold

312
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
to those countries who allow medicinal

313
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,519
cannabis

314
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
for their patients

315
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,199
that is of course a different route and

316
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
you may of course also calculate the

317
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
respect of saving on costs if you are

318
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,599
not

319
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,519
actually doing a ugmp certified

320
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,278
cultivating in a

321
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,278
country outside of the european union

322
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,559
whether this route will be viable also

323
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,480
in the future is difficult the

324
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,679
authorities are very closely looking

325
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,680
into that

326
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:45,359
it is actually one of those grey zones

327
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,359
one of these

328
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,959
gaps i would say

329
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,759
which

330
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,879
has been

331
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,120
[Music]

332
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,320
identified by

333
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
companies

334
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,240
between gacp and gmp regulations gmp-1

335
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,200
and gmp-2

336
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,399
there is a drying process allowed a

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,240
pre-drying process allowed under gacp

338
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,480
and of course everything which is now

339
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,560
then drying of course and cutting and

340
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,120
filtering and whatever is necessary

341
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:18,399
to to really make a product of it is

342
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,159
under eu gmp or under gmp

343
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:25,039
so these flowers gacp flowers

344
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,439
can only be pre-dried

345
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,000
and then shipped

346
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,760
so the authorities are looking into that

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,759
i don't know whether this is a

348
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,600
sustainable route for the next let's say

349
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,200
two to five years

350
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
but it is a way

351
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
which you should be aware if you are in

352
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,439
that market

353
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,959
let's talk a little bit about the

354
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,399
quantities

355
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,320
this is not the consumption

356
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,519
this is not what has been imported

357
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
this is

358
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,360
the estimation of the bay farm of the

359
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,720
federal opium agency at the bay farm

360
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,680
which is

361
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,480
reported to the incb

362
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,838
the incb is the international control

363
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,039
narcotic control board as

364
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,839
established by the

365
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,919
1961 u.n single convention which gives

366
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,680
certain quotas

367
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:29,360
to countries for the importation of

368
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,120
drugs but also of course for cannabis

369
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,560
so and these are the

370
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
uh

371
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,638
numbers for

372
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,839
2017 and up to 2020 which the b farm has

373
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,839
reported to the incb these are not

374
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,839
actually

375
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,920
importations the importations for 2020

376
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,519
of cannabis flowers are in the region of

377
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,958
10 metric tons

378
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:56,839
a little bit more and or less

379
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:59,518
the 28.4 for 25 are also including of

380
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,199
course extracts

381
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,759
and by extracts we have to say that the

382
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,120
calculation is different from just on a

383
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,759
per gram

384
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,480
flower basis because it's

385
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,559
multiplied by a certain factor so it's

386
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,120
getting a little bit complicated but

387
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,518
that's actually what the federal opium

388
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,720
agency has

389
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,679
applied for at the icincb and the incb

390
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,360
is of course very forthcoming

391
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,278
they are actually approving quickly

392
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,959
if you have an additional need for

393
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,480
importation in order to serve your

394
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,319
patients in order to serve the market

395
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
for 2021 it's

396
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,759
25 metric tons

397
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,278
a little bit below of last year take

398
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:49,000
into consideration that the actual

399
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:49,000
import was of course below the 28.4

400
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:55,439
so why i'm saying that

401
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:58,559
coming back to the 10.4 metric tons for

402
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,839
the german cannabis for four years

403
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,559
so if

404
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,639
i'm

405
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,919
right in calculation it's 2.6 tonnes per

406
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,839
annum

407
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,120
which as i said is only half the truth

408
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,800
tender process and we have been

409
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,839
representing one of the

410
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,519
uh

411
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,920
not of one of these but one of the one

412
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,198
company in the tender process

413
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,559
is that the bay farm can exceed can

414
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,719
increase

415
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,719
the quantity by up to 50

416
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,120
so it's not only 10.4

417
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:34,000
so if you do it on an annual basis it's

418
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:36,560
2.6 plus 50 percent then we are at 3.9

419
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,958
so it's nearly 4 metric tons

420
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,078
take into consideration that we had

421
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,958
around 10 tons of flowers imported last

422
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,958
year

423
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,159
it is not neglectable anymore

424
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,000
the

425
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,159
if the bay farm is going to increase

426
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,799
there are rumors in the market that

427
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,159
this 50 increase has been

428
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,399
established

429
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,919
i haven't seen any public announcement

430
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,160
yet of the bee farm

431
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:06,879
but the tender actually allows for that

432
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,600
and what are the prices

433
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,520
do you know the prices for

434
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,279
a per gram

435
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,679
flower

436
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,119
sold by a german cultivator to the b

437
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,240
farm

438
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,239
it's publicly available

439
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,280
it's two it's 2.2

440
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,279
euros

441
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,200
220

442
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,879
per gram

443
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,558
sold by the

444
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,200
cultivator to the bee farm because the

445
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,279
bee farm is going and is obliged to

446
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
purchase all the harvest of the german

447
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,000
cultivation and then distribute that to

448
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,080
the pharmacies as the 1961 single

449
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,480
convention provides

450
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,119
very similar to the netherlands where we

451
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,839
have also the omc which is actually

452
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,079
distributing all the cultivation of

453
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,918
cannabis flowers and products uh

454
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,319
cultivated in or produced in the

455
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,320
netherlands

456
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,159
so the question is what is the sales

457
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,038
price

458
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,960
of

459
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,119
the b firm of the

460
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,600
opium agency or the cannabis agency to

461
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,399
the pharmacies

462
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,480
well

463
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,000
there are rumors

464
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,798
that it should be in the region of 4.3

465
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
for

466
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,679
euros 30.

467
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
which

468
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,880
compared to the current pricing i don't

469
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,038
know whether you are familiar with the

470
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,200
current pricing within the german market

471
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,000
is significantly lower than what has is

472
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,440
currently being achieved

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,919
as you know

474
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,240
in germany

475
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,280
cannabis products are qualified as

476
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,240
extemporaneous mixtures

477
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,960
this has been done to avoid two two

478
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,880
issues when cannabis actually was

479
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,679
allowed for the

480
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,480
use as a medicine number one

481
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,080
you don't need a marketing authorization

482
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,720
you can sell the product why are the

483
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,359
pharmacies immediately this was one of

484
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,519
the intentions of the lawmakers make

485
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,279
cannabis as a medicinal product

486
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,599
available to the patients as quickly as

487
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,200
possible number two

488
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,399
cannabis products didn't have to go

489
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,759
through the

490
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,559
price fixing mechanism for new

491
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,119
pharmaceuticals for the german market

492
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,160
which is a very complicated process

493
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,359
pfizer

494
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,200
novartis zando and all the others if

495
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,199
they want to put a new pharmaceutical on

496
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
the market they have to go through that

497
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,279
price fixing

498
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,120
mechanism this

499
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,200
committee which is called the combined

500
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,439
zamabundus austrias

501
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,279
where you have different stakeholders of

502
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,279
the industry sitting there discussing

503
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,879
with the manufacturer about the right

504
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,279
price

505
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,440
this was not necessary

506
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:49,200
for the cannabis products

507
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,640
so we had i would say paradise in 2017

508
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,600
2018 even 2090

509
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,360
the downside of the definition of

510
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,240
cannabis products as an extemporaneous

511
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,399
mixture was that the pharmacies had to

512
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,919
put on a surcharge

513
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,840
by law

514
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,240
of a hundred percent of the price they

515
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,678
paid for the cannabis

516
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,839
so all of a sudden

517
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,000
at that time let's say go back to 2018

518
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:18,240
2019 we had a per gram price of 10 euros

519
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,480
for flowers sold by a wholesaler or an

520
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,720
importer to the pharmacies and then the

521
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,360
100 surcharge came and all of a sudden

522
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,960
we had the price of 20 euros

523
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,119
per gram

524
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,159
of cannabis flowers to the for the

525
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,439
patient

526
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,200
to be reimbursed by the respective

527
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
health authorities sorry health

528
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
insurances

529
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,400
because we have a compulsory health

530
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,559
insurance program here in place in

531
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,559
germany as you may know which

532
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,440
if you apply and get

533
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:49,279
respective approval reimburses you for

534
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,759
the treatment of your disease with

535
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,079
cannabis products

536
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,119
that was

537
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,720
difficult

538
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,558
to say at least

539
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,079
so the health insurance companies

540
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,639
actually said well that's not possible

541
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,960
we have to find a mechanism to really

542
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,960
get that under control

543
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,759
and that was that was done

544
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,759
by

545
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,119
the association of the

546
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,798
respective

547
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,959
health insurance companies and the

548
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,038
associations of the pharmacies

549
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,480
by setting a price

550
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,480
of a maximum

551
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,480
of 9.52

552
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,480
952 per gram as a price per gram sold by

553
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,798
wholesalers and distributors to the

554
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,360
pharmacies

555
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,839
and then of course the surcharge will be

556
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,879
added but not a hundred percent it is

557
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,000
actually

558
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,799
going down

559
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,798
by quantity

560
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,199
so having said that

561
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,639
and knowing that currently the pricing

562
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,759
in the market is even below the 952 per

563
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,919
gram

564
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,759
because there are rebates granted to the

565
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,038
respective by the respective

566
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:59,038
distributors and wholesalers

567
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,839
the price of the german cannabis

568
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,640
may

569
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,759
have an impact on the whole system and

570
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,840
there are

571
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,400
pharmacies there are single pharmacies

572
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,558
who actually already said why should i

573
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,640
buy today from you

574
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:17,519
your cannabis for let's say 750 or 680

575
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,200
per gram if i can get that from a german

576
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,599
from the german distribution from the b

577
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,279
farm actually for 420

578
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,359
so this is

579
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,879
kind of a disturbance already going on

580
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,399
the market which you should know in

581
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,400
which it should take into consideration

582
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,158
just a little bit of an overlook about

583
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,480
the importation of medical cannabis

584
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,400
in 2017 and 20

585
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,000
up to 2020.

586
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
as you can see we

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,038
uh it's kind of different in the

588
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
quarters

589
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,720
of course everything was impacted by the

590
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:56,000
risk by by the pandemic which we all

591
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,558
know the cultivation process in germany

592
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,798
was slowed down as well as the

593
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,240
respective

594
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,200
increase of

595
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,720
the

596
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,720
distribution to the patients

597
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,760
and as you know

598
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,759
uh the

599
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,240
distribution of cannabis for patients in

600
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,759
germany is

601
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,000
very very well under controlled by the

602
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,640
bee farm so if you are a patient you

603
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,319
have to go to your physician tell him

604
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,080
that you have a certain disease which

605
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,240
you believe would should be treated with

606
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,399
cannabis and maybe he is even

607
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,519
supporting that and is

608
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
proposing

609
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,240
this

610
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,599
to you

611
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,440
but then the whole issue starts

612
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,480
patient and physician have to sit

613
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,000
together

614
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,159
and fill in

615
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,319
i would say a significant

616
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,240
form

617
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,200
to be to apply for the reimbursement to

618
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,480
the respective health insurance

619
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,080
of all applications around 40 percent

620
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
are rejected

621
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,839
60 are granted

622
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,159
for reimbursement

623
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:06,158
just over the thumb the question is only

624
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,640
are the new applications or there are

625
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,679
mistakes in the format it's wrong

626
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,400
information and the rejection

627
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,519
reasons are not really transparent to be

628
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,679
very frank

629
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,119
but that's the rule of thumb so 60

630
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,640
actually

631
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,798
are

632
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,520
granted

633
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:29,440
and now the physician

634
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:33,599
has to monitor his treatment

635
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,320
so he has to report to the bee farm

636
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,719
for which indication he has prescribed

637
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:41,200
what kind of product

638
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,679
and what is the result

639
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,120
so if you look into that and if you uh

640
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,120
what's happening in the industry for the

641
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,918
farmers industry for for quite some time

642
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,599
it is a large observational study

643
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,559
it is a significant observational

644
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,119
stubbly with now more than we guess they

645
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,319
said around 80 000 patients maybe more

646
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,798
maybe less

647
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,759
so these data are all collected by the b

648
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,960
farm

649
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,119
and they are transparent they are

650
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,079
reported and i think it's worthwhile to

651
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,359
look into those and i have for you uh

652
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,319
put together

653
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,439
uh

654
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,839
the

655
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,720
respective

656
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,599
uh

657
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
indications

658
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,600
and the vast majority

659
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:26,240
of treatment with medicine in cannabis

660
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,038
is for pain

661
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,400
followed by specificity

662
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,640
and other indications

663
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,080
and we have discussed yesterday

664
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,559
what is really the future of the market

665
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,079
will we see finnish products finished

666
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:46,158
cannabis products as like sativex

667
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,079
and there are of course companies

668
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
who are doing clinical studies in

669
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,000
different stages clinical phase two

670
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,278
clinical phase two a to b

671
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,960
in order to

672
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:58,720
see whether they

673
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,600
can get the marketing authorization for

674
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
cannabis related products as a finished

675
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,000
product

676
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
from my point of view that's my personal

677
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,799
opinion

678
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,120
clinical studies in that field are

679
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,200
difficult

680
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,399
uh of course when we discuss that as i

681
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,080
said yesterday the end points

682
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,880
defined in your clinical study have to

683
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:25,278
be very carefully selected

684
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,480
now if you don't if you miss the end

685
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,240
points you fail with your clinical study

686
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,440
and even worse

687
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,038
according to the new transparency rules

688
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,000
regarding clinical study within the

689
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,240
european union this has to be published

690
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,240
so you can't hide that somewhere

691
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
and the question is whether this has an

692
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,079
impact

693
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,038
on the whole industry if clinical

694
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,960
studies for specific indications

695
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,558
are are failing

696
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,519
and the

697
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,038
uh

698
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,558
percentage of failing well it's

699
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,599
difficult to say for cannabis because

700
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:59,759
you know

701
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,959
cannabis is well known you don't have

702
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,879
the toxicity issue uh you can actually

703
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,720
start relatively quickly if it's to a to

704
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,200
b and

705
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,440
then into clinical phase three

706
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
but however there are chances that you

707
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,440
will fail

708
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,720
and as such it has to be very well

709
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,640
considered

710
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,720
whether you start into such a clinical

711
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,720
trial with a cannabis product

712
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,200
having said that

713
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,840
let's look a little bit into

714
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,840
what is coming up

715
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,038
these are those countries where we have

716
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,558
approved exporters the netherlands of

717
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,679
course in canada

718
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,918
spain portugal denmark and australia

719
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,320
and if i'm not mistaken lisotto is

720
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,840
already one of those countries which

721
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,960
means

722
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,678
that

723
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,798
cultivators producers in those countries

724
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,200
have received the respective

725
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,119
license to

726
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,360
export their products into the german

727
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,759
market

728
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,918
in discussion currently malta uruguay

729
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,759
israel lisotto and of course colombia

730
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,320
who just recently changed

731
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,839
their legal system regarding the export

732
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,839
of medicinal products

733
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,679
so

734
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:25,038
looking into that

735
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,480
we will have a significant number of new

736
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,720
cultivators

737
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,480
within the european union who don't have

738
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,919
that eu gmp issue because their gmp

739
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,679
certification in the respective

740
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,000
countries automatically recognized by

741
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,360
all other eu member states

742
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,839
and of course those from other countries

743
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,918
so it will

744
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,158
become from

745
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,840
a distributor more from a from a

746
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,039
distributor market

747
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,199
more to

748
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:55,599
of now from a cultivator market to a

749
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,558
distributed market the distributors may

750
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,079
then look who is actually providing

751
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,038
a consistent

752
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,359
and the right quality in order to market

753
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,278
it within the german market

754
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,119
just for your consideration we have of

755
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,200
course and we have

756
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,278
heard that kind of an overproduction

757
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,679
already well not really two

758
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:19,038
if you look into what kind of cannabis

759
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,278
is currently demanded in the market

760
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,798
and what kind of cannabis is really

761
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:28,079
produced so currently and that's a very

762
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,759
similar development as in canada high

763
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,000
thc

764
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,480
percentage cannabis products are on

765
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,398
demand and they are not that

766
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,880
significantly available on the market at

767
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,879
this point in time

768
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
so what are the challenges

769
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,918
the industry faces in the future here in

770
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,000
germany

771
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,799
i mentioned only the first one this is

772
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,599
the

773
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,679
risk question regarding the acp products

774
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,278
and the importation

775
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,720
what is i think

776
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,558
interesting

777
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,519
is

778
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,398
that

779
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,319
a lot of issues are coming up with

780
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:07,519
respect to

781
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:10,240
the the definition of cannabis as a

782
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,480
ex-temporaries mixture

783
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,120
back in 29 we had a client who actually

784
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,960
asked i would like to import irradiated

785
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,798
cannabis it's good for

786
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,519
the microbiology we have a better

787
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,359
microbiology if we're going to irrigate

788
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:27,359
them in the in the country of

789
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,359
cultivation what do we have to do

790
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,720
we asked the bay farm so what do we have

791
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,360
to do what does our client have to do

792
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,919
and they said well yes

793
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,240
just do the following inform the lower

794
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,600
authority which is actually approving

795
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,000
the import

796
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,000
for that specific lot

797
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,240
and tell them that the products are

798
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,480
irradiated

799
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,960
okay we did that they approved it it was

800
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,960
imported

801
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,440
sometime later in 2019 actually what

802
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,159
happened is

803
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,038
that the b fund changed at mind

804
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,399
today if you are going to import

805
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,480
or distribute

806
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,879
irradiated flowers you need to have a

807
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,399
special license in addition to those

808
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,799
licenses which have been guarded which

809
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,639
is a license under the so-called amrat

810
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,599
fowl this is the law for

811
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,200
irradiated finished pharmaceuticals

812
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:23,038
which the bee farm is now applying one

813
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,240
to one to an x temporaries mixture

814
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,558
the reason

815
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,640
frankly speaking i i can't tell you

816
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,079
because if you go by

817
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,080
the definition

818
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:35,119
an x temporaries mixture doesn't need to

819
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:38,158
have an approval for irradiation because

820
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,759
it's not a ready-made pharmaceutical

821
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,600
however the b form decides differently

822
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,599
and now comes the conclusion

823
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,278
one of our clients has been asked

824
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,240
whether

825
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,159
he under the german pharmaceutical act

826
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,960
has a specific product liability

827
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,440
insurance in place for the for putting

828
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,480
irradiated products irradiated cannabis

829
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,759
flowers on the market

830
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,919
we said no

831
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,480
no why

832
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,799
this is not a finished product

833
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,640
we don't need to have

834
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,759
this kind of product liability insurance

835
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,919
under paragraph 93 of the of the

836
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:19,359
pharmaceutical act which by the way has

837
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,960
a coverage of 130 million

838
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,879
so and the the premium is significant

839
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,278
so one state authority in germany

840
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,600
actually said you have to have that

841
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,919
and they of course have covered that for

842
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,879
the products which are irradiated

843
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,799
because the iteration license according

844
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,760
to that state author to that state

845
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,519
authority is a marketing authorization

846
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,440
which is similar to the marketing

847
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,679
authorization which is granted for

848
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,080
finished products

849
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,080
oops

850
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,559
so

851
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,159
if you are in this specific state you

852
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,678
have this you have a disadvantage by

853
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,000
adding this

854
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,519
significant insurance premium per annum

855
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,720
to your products we have looked into

856
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,319
that

857
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,000
and frankly speaking

858
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,200
uh it is as

859
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,960
i said earlier a loophole a gray zone

860
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,720
gray area again

861
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,319
which one of the state authorities has

862
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,919
interpreted differently from others

863
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,000
because we have asked the others what

864
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,559
are you doing with that i said no we

865
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,200
don't you don't need that our our the

866
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,720
cannabis companies in our state don't

867
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,319
need that this is an extemporaneous

868
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,278
mixture

869
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,038
so this is giving just an overview about

870
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,919
how heterogeneous even within the

871
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:37,038
germany different state authorities are

872
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,559
looking into regulatory matters

873
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,558
so last but not least

874
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,678
what are what is the future

875
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,639
of

876
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,640
product in the market

877
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,360
the question is is the future of

878
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,120
ready-made pharmaceuticals with

879
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,479
marketing authorization

880
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,678
is the future

881
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,399
flowers

882
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,000
we have now around i would say 80 you

883
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,759
know that may be better than me

884
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,159
80 flower market is it extracts

885
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,879
is it vaporizers

886
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,159
or maybe a vaporizer with an extra

887
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,159
cartridge

888
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,919
uh would be would be

889
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,838
a very good

890
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,398
idea

891
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,358
only this one is already then a finished

892
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,480
product

893
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,159
not anymore extemporized mixture only if

894
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,838
the cartridge would be then filled by

895
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,079
the pharmacist

896
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,679
and then put into the into the vaporizer

897
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,280
can be put in the vaporizer then it

898
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,119
would qualify as an ex temporaries

899
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,679
mixture so i know that there are

900
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,399
companies looking into that finding a

901
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,679
way to work around that and see whether

902
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,679
this is possible

903
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,239
it's very difficult to foresee where the

904
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,480
market is going

905
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,638
it's very dynamic maybe

906
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,519
you have a look into the canadian market

907
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,559
there you have also a recreational

908
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,800
market

909
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,239
in germany you don't have that

910
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
whether it will come

911
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,279
well let's wait until september 26 and

912
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,680
see how the next government is looking

913
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,400
like you know if the conservative party

914
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,480
is playing a significant role in that uh

915
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,559
government then i would say we have to

916
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,960
wait for another five to seven years

917
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,480
uh before the recreational

918
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,639
use will come

919
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,440
if it's it's different we will maybe

920
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:23,679
have that very quickly or not

921
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,440
so let's see what september 26 brings

922
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:28,000
so by having said that

923
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,920
i would like to to finish that keynote

924
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,039
i'm sorry that i don't have a joke for

925
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,599
you yeah it is it was kind of serious

926
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,279
giving you an overview about the market

927
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,838
getting giving an overview about what is

928
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,000
happening to the uh cultivation in

929
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,400
germany and what kind of impact it may

930
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,250
have to your business thank you very

931
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,920
much

932
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,550
[Applause]

933
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,599
[Music]

934
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:54,240
[Applause]

935
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,960
peter hamburg one more time

936
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,799
do you have time for a few questions

937
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,760
you have time for a few questions yes do

938
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,760
anyone have a question

939
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,079
why do you always have to sit in the

940
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,079
back

941
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,519
jan

942
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:15,119
i have one question uh regarding the

943
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,119
future of reimbursement

944
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,039
as you mentioned under the the

945
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,000
federal

946
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,759
court rule decision the law was made

947
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,480
in terms that there should be

948
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,599
availability that was the major point

949
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,838
now we are seeing changes in um for

950
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,280
example the pset end numbers so it's

951
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,799
easier to track which company does which

952
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,079
product

953
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,839
and

954
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,000
i understand that

955
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,880
with this change it might be possible to

956
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,679
integrate cannabis more into the german

957
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,680
reimbursement system which would meant

958
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:53,679
which would mean all those awful words

959
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:55,679
like uh gbr like robert fatrega all the

960
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,199
things that the pharmaceutical industry

961
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,358
is fearing

962
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,639
what's your outlook on this

963
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,559
as i said

964
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,719
currently we have this

965
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,719
wonderful situation

966
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,319
that the prices are not really

967
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,118
controlled

968
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,960
except for this fixing of the price

969
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,760
between the

970
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,240
wholesaler and the pharmacies at 9.52

971
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,599
which we all know is even difficult to

972
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,679
achieve because

973
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,838
the the market is

974
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,399
from a pharmacy point of view reacting

975
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:30,480
differently we have now large pharmacies

976
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,599
or pharmacies who are going to to

977
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,079
combine their buying power and

978
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,039
discussing with respect of wholesalers

979
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,400
the prices downwards

980
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,119
we have seen

981
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,838
various rebates

982
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,280
i don't believe that as long as the

983
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,920
products are

984
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,920
defined as extemporaneous mixtures we

985
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,000
will see a price fixing uh like the uh

986
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,480
for pharmaceuticals under the with the

987
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,159
gba with the mines and bonus oysters

988
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,880
however and that's something which you

989
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,879
should consider if you are looking into

990
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,880
a ready-made pharmaceutical

991
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,400
with clinical trials getting marketing

992
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,640
approval

993
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,400
then of course this product

994
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,639
coming to the market needs to go through

995
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,160
the gba

996
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,759
and then the question is what is the

997
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,118
right price

998
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,800
is something which you have to bear in

999
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,720
mind which today pharmaceutical

1000
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,880
companies are bearing in mind as well

1001
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,358
and i can tell you that

1002
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,760
since 2019

1003
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:32,880
around 36

1004
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,440
innovative pharmaceuticals produced by

1005
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,519
large pharmaceutical companies have not

1006
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,599
reached the german market

1007
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,559
they have they have withdrawn after the

1008
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,720
discussion with the gba because they are

1009
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,599
not

1010
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,759
satisfied with the respective proposal

1011
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,320
for the prices for the for the german

1012
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,160
market and what you have to know also is

1013
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,240
that the german market is not a

1014
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,639
reference market for other markets

1015
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,319
regarding the pricing of pharmaceuticals

1016
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,039
while this is not applicable of course

1017
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,760
to to cannabis products right now but as

1018
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,759
i said as long as you are in that safe

1019
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,640
area of x temporaries mixture i would

1020
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,760
really

1021
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:16,000
advise not to leave that and not to move

1022
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,720
something from somewhere else it is

1023
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,880
not very likely that we have a price

1024
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,159
fixing we will have price controls

1025
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,079
definitely with regard to the

1026
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,399
reimbursement

1027
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,720
but so far the health insurance

1028
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,480
companies are more or less satisfied

1029
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,159
with that

1030
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,400
additional

1031
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,399
implementation of the 952.

1032

denmark i have a question regarding the

1036
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,838
phase three trial that you mentioned

1037
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,039
that they're risk-taking by not meeting

1038
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,599
end points

1039
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:58,159
but if you look at in the positive side

1040
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,519
what is the likelihood to protect your

1041
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,319
product and

1042
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,239
take a patent on your indication

1043
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,200
well the point is of course if you have

1044
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,039
reached

1045
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,039
positive 2b

1046
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,039
you know clinical phase 3 and the

1047
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,119
failure rate is relatively lower in

1048
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,279
comparison to the first clinical trial

1049
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,599
one and clinical trial two phases

1050
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,359
so if you have reached clinical phase

1051
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,920
three there's a likelihood that you're

1052
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,679
going to reach the market and of course

1053
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,519
you have a certain protection of the

1054
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,199
product and we discussed it yesterday

1055
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:32,079
you know the the effect of having a

1056
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:35,598
pharmaceutical product on the market

1057
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,760
uh which is properly recognized and

1058
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,519
has received marketing authorization is

1059
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,200
of course significant in comparison to

1060
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,039
selling flowers

1061
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,358
yeah but how you can protect it it's

1062
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,920
going to be just generic any anybody

1063
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,199
who's a cultivator they can claim for

1064
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,358
the indication

1065
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,358
like a generic products

1066
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,119
not at not not at the first not

1067
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,598
immediately you have kind of a document

1068
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,280
protection as well yes uh and of course

1069
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,760
if you are able to combine your product

1070
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,599
with something new you may also consider

1071
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,640
patent protection which is a big issue

1072
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,359
right now in the industry how can i try

1073
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,440
to obtain patent protection ip

1074
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,119
protection for my products

1075
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,079
and there are of course a lots of

1076
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,838
different

1077
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,400
thoughts about that even with regard to

1078
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:24,000
application how do a how do i apply not

1079
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,599
smoking of course

1080
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,239
what kind of inhalers what kind of

1081
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,880
vaporizers how can i protect these

1082
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:34,519
technologies this is a big issue

1083
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,519
thank you you're welcome

1084
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,239
you
