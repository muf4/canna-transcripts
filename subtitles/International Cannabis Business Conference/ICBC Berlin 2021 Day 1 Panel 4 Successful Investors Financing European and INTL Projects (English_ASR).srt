pleasure to be joined in today my

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,079
four real sector leading experts in the

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,160
financial ecosystem who i think all have

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,000
really unique and international

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
perspectives to share today

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,599
um in today's panel we're going to be

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
covering the current investment

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,000
opportunities in europe

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,439
we're going to be taking a look at the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,799
sort of professional investors that are

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,079
actually active in the sector at the

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,119
minute and then also diving into some of

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,119
the

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,320
blockers and hurdles that we need to

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,359
overcome to get wider kind of adoption

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
um

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,878
and now that's kind of hand over to our

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
parliament

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,439
introduction to themselves before we

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,439
kick off

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,159
so my name is marcus mozar i'm

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,879
around 25 years in the financial sector

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,119
i started from university as an analyst

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,198
and then i was running for 12 years fund

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,478
for banks in switzerland germany and

30
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,599
luxembourg

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,319
and the last 50 years i concentrated

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,719
mostly on metal resources in the last

33
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,959
two years because of lockdown i looked

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,519
for new industry so i looked over

35
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,839
cryptocurrencies and canadians and then

36
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,359
i found out that cryptocurrency is a bit

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,000
too complicated

38
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,040
and greatest is more easy because you

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,319
can

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
consume it

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,559
you can

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,280
touch it and

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
then the last two years i spent

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,640
exploring

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,200
companies investors mostly in europe and

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,118
yeah that's the reason i'm here

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,359

48
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,040

[Music]

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,399
fantastic thanks guys

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
so the first kind of topic that i think

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,159
would be really interesting to dive into

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,160
is the current actual opportunities to

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,960
invest in european cannabis companies i

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,199
mean the focus to date has often been on

117
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,680
north americans especially in terms of

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
uh publicly traded companies but we've

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
really really seen the last few years

120
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,519
that i think the parliament will test

121
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
a lot of interesting opportunities now

122
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,359
coming in for european players and

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,040
european investors

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
markets i guess from you

125
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:50,688
[Music]

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,360
generally open and

127
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,599
maybe i mentioned that last year i did

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,759
the large research about european

129
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
canadian startups mainly in the

130
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
german-speaking countries germany

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,400
switzerland and austria

132
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,479
and the big private equity company as in

133
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,879
selling dutch in the world was looking

134
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,439
for opportunities in the canadian space

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,800
it was very difficult for me to find

136
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,800
the companies

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,680
which still to them because most of the

138
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,520
companies are too small and for myself i

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,918
don't care about the size but most

140
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,159
investors looking at companies who have

141
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,279
already a certain turnover

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,800
as earnings some positive numbers and i

143
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,839
think that's a bit difficult at the

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,240
moment to find because we are very early

145
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,000
spanish i invested personally a couple

146
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,439
of weeks ago in a tissue cultural

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,839
property out of canada they do mostly

148
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,759
business in u.s in my idea is to bring

149
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,159
them over to europe because it's a new

150
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,960
technology and tissue culturally i think

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,960
it's a very interesting field

152
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,120
for sure does anyone ask any thoughts

153
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,799
any specific areas that you think are

154
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,840
particularly interesting and the work

155
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
people keep an eye out for

156
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,799
answering your first question as well um

157
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
we tried to have a balanced portfolio of

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,600
liquid and non-liquid assets so we've

159
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,759
invested for example in youtube which is

160
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,160
listed particularly in connection with

161
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,639
the position of the economy subsidiary

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
in denmark and then we also have more

163
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,720
like vc type of fields we recently

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
invested in an equal amount in europe's

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,160
farmer here in germany

166
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
and in terms of restrictions i think

167
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,960
it's important to mention being a uk

168
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
regulated fund we can't invest in the

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,198
recreation sectors that's obviously the

170
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,198
implementation that we have

171
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,919
other than that we are open for

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,038
opportunities of course but i would say

173
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,038
that at these moments in 2001

174
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,038
uh

175
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,569
[Music]

176
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,639
yeah for sure and i think revenues are

177
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,639
something that we haven't always seen

178
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,400
today but we are finally now seeing

179
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
players coming in and really getting

180
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,120
those weapons up

181
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,280
and i'm telling the only kind of

182
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,639
investments you're currently raising for

183
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,279
yourself or any kind of opportunity

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,519
and yeah i think our general

185
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,839
investment approach is when we look at

186
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,240
the canons industry everything we see

187
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,560
here in europe currently in germany for

188
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,120
example as a new and emerging and

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,478
medicine campus market is not entirely

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,720
new yet

191
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,598
and if we just take a look into north

192
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,520
america we see that there are more than

193
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,839
50 new restrictions basically but

194
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,318
legalized medicine accounts in some

195
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,439
shape or form in the past

196
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,800
so what uh what rico is doing what we

197
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,319
are doing and

198
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,598
we are operating actively in those more

199
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,080
mature

200
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,079
markets like the united states we are

201
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,038
in our retail operations when you guys

202
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,839
we are processing 16 000 patient

203
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,839
contacts a month

204
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,839
and looking into those more

205
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,318
new and emerging markets we are

206
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,359
investing the preliminary

207
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
in

208
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
infrastructure

209
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,919
and then basically what we are doing is

210
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,840
we

211
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,439
collect a lot of data points in the

212
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:18,478
united states and try to identify

213
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,879
certain parallels or patterns basically

214
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,680
what we then can assume

215
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,240
will

216
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,699
take place in a new and early market

217
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
like harmony

218
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,639
[Music]

219
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,278
when we identify a product or a concept

220
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,080
what fits those requirements

221
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,519
we are focusing all our efforts on

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,639
timing

223
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,599
to find out are we basically are we

224
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,879
too late for that concept are we maybe

225
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,720
too early

226
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,159
or are we maybe just exactly right

227
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,440
and

228
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,559
when all those

229
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,800
check boxes check and we all come to the

230
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,000
conclusion that it's work we work it

231
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:03,120
then we incorporate spinners in

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,919
for example in germany or denmark and

233
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,839
will go to them really quick to revenue

234
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,838
and also really track to profitability

235
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,958
fantastic

236
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
and matthias you've spent quite a lot of

237
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,278
time both in the north american and the

238
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,799
european sector and got to know the

239
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,639
investors that

240
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,639
do you have a lot of advice for people

241
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,879
the professional uh institutional

242
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
investment we have

243
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,360
we have a

244
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,079
20-year history of investing into

245
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,080
certain industries to grow kind of the

246
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,879
divisional players

247
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,040
and

248
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,360
we have a tradition of always moving

249
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,919
into businesses with our own funds grow

250
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,240
them to a certain stage and only then

251
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,399
reach out to the capital markets and

252
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,759
seek for kind of accelerated

253
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,799
investments

254
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,879
um

255
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,240
we've this has worked out fairly well

256
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,039
and successfully for the move in the

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,799
past admittedly though our past focus

258
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,599
has been on more

259
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,199
conservative and mature industries

260
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
than canada is

261
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
today we've been in canada space for

262
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,079
three years uh we've grown into a

263
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,480
reasonable size and what we consider

264
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,319
sustainable uh position in terms of

265
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,639
operation and financial performance in

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
our own funds and right now we're just

267
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,639
at a point where

268
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,559
looking into the capital markets uh for

269
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,278
potential accelerated investments we're

270
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,278
looking at both sides of the ocean but

271
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,679
in europe obviously there's a lot of

272
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,838
feedback that the uncertainty

273
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,078
concerning the regulatory framework is

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,760
made like there's no visibility it has

275
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,078
to revert forward

276
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,919
which is a key model for investors to

277
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,559
pass on opportunities

278
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,639
as a quick speaks to that go to the us

279
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,559
but if you go into north america we

280
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,639
sense this is a lot of baggage from the

281
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,199
first wave of the under the president

282
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,199
where a whole lot of cash was burned on

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,360
early stage benches that

284
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,640
i think just tried to become a little

285
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
too fast and

286
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,879
just overpaced so they are one of the

287
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,199
key challenges obviously is to convince

288
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,759
investors of your business while being a

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,800
solid one you're approaching

290
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,799
one and they uh

291
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,759
that's the key challenges that we're

292
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,959
facing today on either side of the ocean

293
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,958
great and i think there's quite a lot of

294
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,958
yes you mentioned european companies

295
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,159
being acquired by either canadian

296
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,078
producers or usns and

297
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
to my knowledge we were involved in the

298
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,919
largest transaction of our european

299
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,599
company being sold to the canadian lp a

300
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,000
couple of years ago that was the new

301
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,560
veda afria deal we were early investors

302
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,320
there and then more recently and

303
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,359
wildlife sciences being acquired by

304
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,440
curative again we were investors in our

305
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,399
life sciences and there was management

306
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,760
crossover as well i think that was

307
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,919
by the way these two transactions

308
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,799
combined were for a total of one million

309
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,519
which

310
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,879
in industry is quite meaningful and i

311
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,959
would say that

312
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,439
that signals the importance of having a

313
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,359
good strategic investor early

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,079
on uh that understands the industry

315
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,959
right because i mean it's fine obviously

316
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,838
it's startups fine i don't know tech

317
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,799
is investing in them that

318
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,959
is but these investors probably won't

319
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,359
understand the industry in the same way

320
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,719
specialized investor good and that may

321
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,959
help down the road for example

322
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,680
negotiating an exit opportunity with a

323
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,149
large canadian or u.s company which was

324
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,370
the case for us

325
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:41,370
[Music]

326
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,958
uh

327
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,000
um in terms of raising them with

328
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
strategic support but in terms of

329
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,759
understanding the business model of

330
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,759
things

331
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,879
[Music]

332
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,639
is understanding the possibilities for

333
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,240
liquidity or exit opportunities which

334
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,919
maybe are

335
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,159
being acquired by a north american

336
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,958
company or more recently involved in the

337
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,639
london ipos and for that it certainly

338
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,559
helps another investor that understands

339
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
the industry but not just in terms of an

340
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,119
exit opportunity but also in terms of

341
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,879
growth right um i mean we've been in the

342
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,720
industry in europe since

343
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,559
inception practically and uh part of our

344
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
our strategy as a fund is not simply to

345
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,039
invest money but also support our

346
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,959
companies and but

347
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,958
i mean the ecosystem is not so big in

348
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:49,319
europe everyone knows each other but

349
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,319
certainly helps to have an investment

350
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,679
and moving on to kind of the

351
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,919
institutional players the investment

352
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,919
banks and private equity funds

353
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,679
we've discussed a lot and we've heard

354
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,559
that kind of the current ticket sizes

355
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,399
and market caps are still quite small to

356
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,399
prevent people getting involved

357
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,600
any of you have any thoughts on what it

358
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,519
would take with the kind of

359
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,959
consolidation needed

360
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,959
to actually make a private

361
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,000
industry this year at the medical campus

362
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,919
industry

363
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,559
level this year will be below 500

364
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,039
million euros and yes it is lowering but

365
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,719
still this is very small for large

366
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,399
institutional investors

367
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
if you're trying to affect the largest

368
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
easy funds

369
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,600
i think everybody in the industry when

370
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,839
the financial industry is aligned that

371
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,560
there's no doubt that cannabis is going

372
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
to make its way

373
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,440
[Music]

374
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,880
by and large

375
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
obviously the uncertainty of the

376
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,838
timeline of the cannabis industry

377
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,839
is something that doesn't play well with

378
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,160
their financial models and that i think

379
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,120
is one of the key challenges we need to

380
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,120
overcome before

381
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,250
[Music]

382
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,799
yeah i also think um kind of advanced

383
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,879
projections per pins and decks is a

384
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,120
other reason to kind of back up that

385
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,360
you're going to become big uh we've kind

386
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,560
of passed the days of that so yeah don't

387
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,399
you kind of have any thoughts on

388
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,039
what kind of um

389
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,278
the cultural differences are between um

390
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,639
north americans and european companies

391
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,399
do you sometimes

392
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,839
see childhood speaking to investors

393
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,759
economies just because of the kind of

394
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,480
disconnect there and the

395
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,720
kind of non-land understanding

396
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,360
i think there's a big problem in

397
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,360
cultural differences because

398
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,519
the sinking in north america is very

399
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,759
different

400
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,078
also i think the canadians market in the

401
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,560
europe is different to the u.s market

402
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,638
and a lot of companies have come over in

403
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,119
the past so that europe is developing

404
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,839
much faster but they didn't thought

405
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,560
about politics and i think the legal

406
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,920
frame is very important that we get

407
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,719
faster to larger entities to larger

408
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,958
companies and attracting more investors

409
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,879
and that's a little problem because

410
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,919
politics are very slow

411
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,559
and

412
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,438
i think it will need times our

413
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,838
government i expect more merchants

414
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,679
also acquisitions so that larger

415
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,318
companies will exist and then we'll

416
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,240
attract also investors because if you

417
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,199
have a 5 million

418
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,400
euro

419
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,120
turnover or 20 billion a journal it's a

420
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,199
big difference and most of the investors

421
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,558
start from 10 million

422
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,240
and at the moment we have maybe a

423
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,599
handful of companies over 100 in europe

424
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,880
exactly

425
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,879
and then you can't have

426
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,480
[Music]

427
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,798
um yeah i think one major struggle every

428
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,919
investor's person who's entering the

429
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,679
kent's

430
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
field for the first time

431
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,919
is the regulatory challenge

432
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
like cannabis

433
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,038
for every investment experience with

434
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,160
cannabis it's a super high regulatory

435
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:56,879
barrier

436
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,679
and

437
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,000
regulatory and compliance has to has to

438
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,960
have a constitutional

439
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
uh

440
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
basically

441
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
an acceptance and priorities in these

442
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,799
companies

443
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,839
i think that's one big struggle every

444
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,079
new investor is facing

445
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:18,240
and when you look a little bit deeper i

446
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,839
think what's also a huge challenge for

447
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,359
the industry is that

448
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,439
the um the real cannabis culture or the

449
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,639
people who carry the real knowledge in

450
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
the industry

451
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,600
basically come from the cme legal

452
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,000
industry they live they work for over 20

453
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:39,279
years in the de facto illegal industry

454
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,679
so and and that that basically

455
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,038
made them

456
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,559
loyalty

457
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,079
secrecy

458
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,798
and and that is in total diametry in our

459
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,879
eyes towards a corporate culture where

460
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,079
it's about transparency quality

461
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,799
management

462
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,038
and i think that is a huge challenge

463
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,038
that all of us are facing in the next 10

464
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,798
years and we are convinced that the

465
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,759
companies who can

466
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,839
merge those titrates basically and

467
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,079
that they will be the most successful

468
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,959
operators

469
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,558
about that i think as these things are

470
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,480
improving right and yeah and you

471
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,160
mentioned that very well in the report

472
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,720
about investing in europe in the case of

473
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,640
the uk that the financial majority

474
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,640
guideline finally clarified

475
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,399
investors to invest in the european

476
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,919
industry so that was great and it

477
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
certainly boosted

478
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,240
the investment space in the past year or

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,640
so in you yeah for sure i think we've

480
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,880
had we have a lot of companies coming up

481
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,120
to us now and really buying the ipo and

482
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
um really kind of uh structuring their

483
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,279
plans for the next few years based on

484
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,600
the fact that they now can rest on the

485
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:53,038
as the main exchange

486
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,038
um i'm kind of diving

487
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,679
[Music]

488
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,918
you mentioned earlier that you're unable

489
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,320
to invest in recreational assets for

490
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,320
companies with any vocational exposure

491
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,239
but

492
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,000
when we approach investment

493
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,519
opportunities we have this very clear

494
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,480
limitation that we can't invest in

495
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,158
recreational even if that is federally

496
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
bigger in the country where the company

497
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,640
operates so let's say canada uruguay

498
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,280
whatever it is some people think it's

499
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,200
about the u.s federal illegality but now

500
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,359
it has nothing to do with that even if

501
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
federal illegal in germany tomorrow he

502
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,918
is a uk investor could invest there

503
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:39,119
because the activity would be

504
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,280
illegal in the uk and that is certainly

505
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,839
a restriction there that we have then

506
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,319
the lower school proceeds

507
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,158
is from 2008

508
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,079
oh yeah this is definitely a key blocker

509
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,679
that i've heard a lot of people saying

510
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,480
they're watching the recreational space

511
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,759
but they're unable to act and strangely

512
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,839
well i guess it's not really too strange

513
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,440
but i've also heard that a lot of cbd

514
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,399
companies are being affected by this as

515
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
well particularly with

516
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,640
but i also say that

517
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
i mean some companies don't like that

518
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
for example when we are negotiating with

519
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,679
them and we tell them okay but if you

520
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,038
were to operate in the recreational

521
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,038
market then you would need to exit

522
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,760
and then all of these components that

523
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:31,038
want to operate in the recreational

524
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,038
sector would be

525
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,769
[Applause]

526
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,769
[Music]

527
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,599
the problem is also that every company

528
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,440
europe has different laws and so

529
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,519
it's very difficult for companies you

530
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,840
know to go to other countries

531
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,519
and i also realized that investors

532
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,678
prefer their hometown

533
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,240
so french investors mainly invest in

534
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,798
clients germany western germany or

535
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,200
german-speaking countries and

536
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,359
that's yeah i think that

537
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,038
should be a bit more open and

538
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,240
i think the regulation

539
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,798
should be

540
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,159
similar in europe and hopefully we can

541
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,558
get there

542
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
for sure

543
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,240
yeah he reminded me of something that i

544
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,240
also see on companies that want to list

545
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,519
in a stock exchange of their country

546
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,159
like

547
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,918
stock exchange patriotism i would say

548
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
and maybe that doesn't make sense right

549
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,919
because we've seen that has been very

550
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,439
successful today at least with the ipos

551
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600
so even if you're a german company it

552
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,480
might make more sense to list in london

553
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,199
than

554
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,880
foreign exchange and

555
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,159
yeah maybe a lot of this in germany

556
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,360
would be nice but i mean my advice is

557
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,840
don't think that because you are

558
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,759
operating in denmark a danish exchange

559
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,399
is the best way to go maybe i'm not

560
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,119
saying it it's not but not necessarily

561
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,919
yeah

562
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,879
i can ask because i have a danish client

563
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,400
and

564
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
they

565
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,840
now

566
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,918
think about to listen to germany because

567
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,240
denmark or a lot of countries are too

568
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,440
small and also stock shades are very

569
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,079
small but to go through ipo is a very

570
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,200
difficult process and i realized that

571
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:26,000
maybe sometimes a shell transaction or a

572
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,558
kind of respect deal is maybe the better

573
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,640
the better idea because i spoke the last

574
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,119
six months with five stock exchange in

575
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,679
germany and they're open but the

576
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,279
knowledge is very limited and so you

577
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
have to explain the laws and they are

578
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,839
not afraid you know uh to list latest

579
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,400
companies and we know there's a lot of

580
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,000
retail investors in london i don't think

581
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,320
anyone can guarantee to me that there's

582
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,960
a lot of written investors in germany

583
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,960
for canada

584
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,798
[Music]

585
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,079
yeah i was just thinking uh marcus

586
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,319
mentioned

587
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,399
back deals and the like

588
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,879
we're in an extremely young industry

589
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,640
it's a buzzing industry and we're just

590
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,559
everybody's struggling to keep up with

591
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,720
the pace that the industry is taking

592
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,359
operationally

593
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,640
as a businessman day-to-day business

594
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,798
operator

595
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,679
my thinking actually is i

596
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:24,639
shouldn't have to worry about complex

597
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,720
listening structures to circumvent

598
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,880
whatever burdens or hurdles we may have

599
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,880
along the way the industry's growing

600
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,559
market is growing people want the

601
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,200
product

602
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,918
all that complication around it is

603
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,798
kind of slowing this down a little bit

604
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,038
and

605
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,200
that's what i wish that at some point

606
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:47,038
we'll get we'll get to a level where

607
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,038
access to capital is

608
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,759
maybe a little bit more serious a little

609
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,960
bit more trustworthy

610
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,759
overcome

611
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
past

612
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,558
past mistakes

613
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,159
i'm on the regulatory financial side

614
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,759
i seriously wish for a little bit more

615
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,400
simplicity

616
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,319
yeah 100 percent and that's why the kind

617
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,559
of how to educate all of the

618
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,038
accommodation financially because the

619
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,038
stock exchanges really about us and

620
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,158
hopefully we are gonna be seeing um that

621
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:23,158
awareness come on over the next years

622
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,159
um

623
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,640
of regarding that emac and uh

624
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,319
transaction for 286 million

625
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,799
can you take a run at breaking down how

626
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,960
do you ask that valuation and are there

627
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,200
a certain number of like golden tokens

628
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,278
that a company needs to amass in order

629
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,200
to accelerate that value from you know

630
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:05,440
more reasonable 50 60 ml valuation

631
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,440
of the right price to that 286

632
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,759
so the short answer is i cannot speak on

633
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,319
details of the transaction but i would

634
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,278
say that for us as an investor our whole

635
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,000
strategy was to create

636
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,319
a

637
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,558
package i would say for a north american

638
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,960
company and even something ready to

639
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,119
potentially develop here in europe which

640
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,600
included a vertically integrated company

641
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,079
from cultivation in portugal to

642
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,399
practical distribution in the uk plus

643
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,278
other assets in germany switzerland et

644
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,360
cetera et cetera so i think the value

645
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,720
comes not from

646
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,959
some of the parts but from the package

647
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,519
that is being sold to a north american

648
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,919
company and the largest one in the us

649
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,079
that if that company were to create that

650
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,038
in europe it would take them very long

651
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,038
they would probably make

652
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,158
anyone else

653
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,558
fantastic remarks thank you

654
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,519
thank you um yeah thanks for all your

655
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,918
time today and your interest um it's

656
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,240
been a great time i think and yeah

657
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,000
really looking forward to hopefully meet

658
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
some of you after and chatting through

659
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,038

660
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,038
and also um chat to you about one of the

661
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,038
yeah
