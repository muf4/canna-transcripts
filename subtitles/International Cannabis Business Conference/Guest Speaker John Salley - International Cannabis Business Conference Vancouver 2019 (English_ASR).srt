import our input helps move this along

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,060

never done it by myself

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,659
I've only done it with a team so it may

26
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:28,179
seem like we're going to be in

27
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:31,000
competition here we literally are in

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,300
unity here because we are still illegal

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,750
in California we're still illegal in

30
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:42,579

44
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:21,049
mimimi

45
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,570
this weed is about us us us the best

46
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,719
thing about having flower is being able

47
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:30,409
to have a community joint also herpes

48
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,900

49
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:35,710
have four for joint so with somebody say

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,370

51
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:41,920
right community amount of yourself what

52
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,009
I'm just being serious

53
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:50,239
but don't net on that thought when we

54
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:53,060
came up the first place I smoked weed a

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,610
lot of weed was in 2000 here in

56
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,039
Vancouver I was doing a movie called an

57
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,620
ultimate Christmas present I bought some

58
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:05,120
weed I didn't know it was a lot I just

59
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,520
knew I could not go through TSA so I had

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,599
to smoke all of the weed and look at the

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,730
water I have seen things that I have

62
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,289
never seen before and I was like I need

63
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:20,840
more weed to the point where I recommend

64
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:22,669
this to my children I recommend that

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,780
they swear I caught one of my daughters

66
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,729
with a vape and it was nicotine and

67
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,669
she's trying to be all cool and hide it

68
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:34,399
and I was like I got CBD vape if you're

69
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:36,169
gonna vape vape this now somebody would

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,110
say but you should have told her not to

71
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:41,119
vape no she's already proven to me she's

72
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,760
going to do what she wants to do and how

73
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,090
it's my job as a parent to give her a

74
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,259
healthy alternative to the other this is

75
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,259
this is what it is

76
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:59,479
in Colorado alcohol has dropped 30

77
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:01,759
percent right duis have gone down the

78
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,039
cops can't sit around and pull you over

79
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,840
they can lean in your car sir do I smell

80
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:10,819
marijuana I don't know what you smell I

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:16,040
can't answer that question I mean things

82
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:18,259
are at a total disconnect from the old

83
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,270
way the fact that he just told me that

84
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:24,379
the person in charge of regulation in

85
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:27,740
Callen Canada was a chief of police

86
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:29,990
that's that's ridiculous that's almost

87
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,980
as ridiculous I'm having sex ed at

88
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,650

90
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,049
sense they're gonna tell you not to

91
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,879
unless you're catholic they're gonna

92
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:43,520
tell you to have as many to bring back

93
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:48,889

kinda this is the this is the spot this

99
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,149
is the place i'm glad no one got out

100
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:06,709
that everybody that comes after i want

101
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:09,019
you to pay attention because there's so

102
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:12,289
many avenues just so many ways we need

103
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:14,419
to touch i live a plant-based diet with

104
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,819
my family my daughter we're vegan so we

105
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,370
believe in every part of the plant we

106
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:21,199
believe in that in the hemp plant we

107
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,709
believe in the sister of the cannabis

108
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,959
plant

109
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:26,449
we believe in the tomato we believe in

110
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,909
the cucumber the asparagus all of that

111
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:32,659
we don't believe in murder of any kind

112
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,720
of any earthly so if you you don't have

113
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,910
to be of that kind but imagine how good

114
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,550
it feels to have plants to nourish your

115
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,560
body right that's why you see the

116
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,840
strongest oxy that's why you see the

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,339
gorillas eat this plant is amazing they

118
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,359
just finished talking about the car

119
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:53,000
sister's outing out in Palm Springs we

120
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,370
are we are on the verge of living longer

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,180
i don't know if you noticed but we

122
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,069
started living longer in the 50s and 60s

123
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,590
would penicillin and some of the things

124
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,930
that they put forth ways we were gonna

125
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,399
eat then they'd started destroying us

126
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,300
again we're packaging and processing

127
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:14,209
it's back to that wave a wave now is

128
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,060
back to nature our wave now is back to

129
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:20,359
enhancing you as a human this plant does

130
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,280
it this is a wonderful place to be I am

131
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,470
ecstatic I met some wonderful people

132
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,719
from New York Jackie and her crew

133
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,850
literally here to get information to

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,330
bring back to New York more people doing

135
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,430
that throughout the United States

136
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:36,680
expands it the United States richest

137
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,259
country in the world maybe not with all

138
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,790
of its minerals but with the minds to

139
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,099
think in mind is the fact that when we

140
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,310
get 25 states that say we're

141
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,460
recreational

142
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,750
soon they're gonna drop and they're

143
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,310
gonna start thinking what's they're

144
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,430
doing they're gonna start thinking of

145
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,930
ways to take it over they just told the

146
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,970
