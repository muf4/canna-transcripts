1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,819
all right oh good you can hear me well

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,460
thanks so much for having us I'm very

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,160
privileged to introduce this esteemed

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,070
panel of licensed distributors in

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,579
California with very diverse business

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,519
models and this group here is I think a

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,288
really solid representation of kind of

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,309
the diversity in our market here in

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,109
California but many of them also have

10
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,909
kind of a global vision a national

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,359
vision so I'm excited for them to get to

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,890
share that with you and on this panel

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:40,619
we'll really be talking about what makes

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,299
distribution work here in California and

15
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,599
I think that applies to most places

16
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,179
around the state um how we achieve kind

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,590
of an efficient market place and we'll

18
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,079
talk about the competitive and

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,480
collaborative landscape for cannabis

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,239
distribution so before we get into all

21
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,339

22
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,339

brands that we have sales as a service

38
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:41,280
hello my name is Wesley Hein and I want

39
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,679
to say one thing this is without a doubt

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,728
the most comfortable panel chair I have

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,340
ever sat in and I'm glad I'm not at the

42
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,118
5 p.m. panel so I apologize for

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,640
slouching

44
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm with mammoth distribution before I

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,299
get that and I warn Lauren I might do

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,219
this as I often answer the question not

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,340
that was asked but that I wish was asked

48
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,709
and I was at an earlier panel and they

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,859
said something which was if you've taken

50
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,780
the time energy and money to come to

51
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,060
this and you haven't reached out to your

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,469
Senators or your Congressman or your

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,349
elected officials

54
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,960
and ask them pleaded with them demanded

55
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,629
them to address whatever ills are faced

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,730
in your jurisdiction whether it's 280e

57
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,169
totally legality or whatever then you

58
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:27,899
have it backwards and that's something

59
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,429
that I implore you as I implore myself

60
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,170
to address right away and when you get

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,810
back start reaching out to those people

62
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,809
that's what we need as much as

63
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,939
distribution now for distribution

64
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,659
we're mammoth distribution we're a

65
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,979
pretty good-sized we have six licenses

66
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:45,750
one thing we do is a little different is

67
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,759
that instead of carrying a variety of

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,709
products we focus on just one which is

69
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,629
vape that's not to say that we don't

70
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,569
think the other categories are important

71
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:57,329
they are fun they really are it's just

72
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:00,780
with all of the changes and advocacy and

73
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,330
an education that is necessary in this

74
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,340
market of tumult we felt that we'd be

75
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,750
best served by just focusing on one

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,719
thing and trying to do that really well

77
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:15,060
and we carry five currently brands vape

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:21,030
brands all distinct our flagship brand

79
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,430
is called heavy hitters awesome

80
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,620
hey everyone my name is Michael

81
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,980
Steinmetz the CEO and one of the

82
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,140
founders of lo kana best way to describe

83
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,419
flow kana is we are a supply chain

84
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,129
company that focuses exclusively with

85
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,559
small farmers from the Emerald triangle

86
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,620
only Sun grown organic sustainable

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,590
products we have two big components to

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,420
our business one is an upstream

89
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,159
processing and manufacturing and then we

90
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,289
have a downstream distribution company

91
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:53,039
the distribution side we've got a hub in

92
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,699
San Diego two hubs in LA Sacramento in

93
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,370
the Bay Area

94
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,589
so about five hubs across the state and

95
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,539
on the upstream side of things we have a

96
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,400
couple aggregation hubs and kind of

97
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,259
densely populated areas where farmers

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
are we have one in southern Humboldt one

99
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,909
in northern Mendocino or opening a third

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,610
one in southern Mendocino as well and we

101
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,699
about two years ago but a the Fetzer

102
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,379
winery in Ukiah and we're turning it

103
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,089
into a centralized processing center to

104
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,798
provide all the services at scale for

105
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,319
the small farmers so they can cultivate

106
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,689
their product dried and cured on farm

107
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,699
estate cured and then we do everything

108
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,379
else the trimming the processing the

109
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,189
packaging

110
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:32,370
Manufacturing and then the downstream

111
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,149
distribution and that's awesome great

112
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,269
thank you

113
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:38,429
well let's kick off with a really kind

114
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:40,439
of open-ended first question which is

115
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,689
tell us tell us about the the

116
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,430
distribution landscape in California and

117
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,709
what that what that looks like and maybe

118
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,900
incorporate some of the ways in which

119
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,659
distributors work with one another and

120
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:53,219
work within the supply chain so let's

121
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,199
see my q would you mind picking us off

122
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,789
sure let's see it's really a challenging

123
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,319
time in California right there's about

124
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:03,240
as many distributors as there are

125
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,098
licensed retailers that's like a one to

126
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,750
one ratio

127
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:08,459
we're also emerging from a world where a

128
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,279
lot of distributors did or a lot of

129
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,659
brands because they didn't exist a

130
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,359
distribution network in the past have

131
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,710
built their own self distribution

132
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,960
components to their business so there's

133
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:20,638
a lot of us in the marketplace

134
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,930
I say it's a pretty amicable and

135
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,439
collaborative environment but I wish it

136
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,629
was more collaborative to be honest and

137
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,139
you know it's it's an interesting time

138
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,759
you know I think I think this year is

139
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,379
probably gonna bring about a lot of

140
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,079
consolidation in the industry both on

141
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,459
the brand side and the distribution side

142
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,899
it's gonna be a you know interesting to

143
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:42,509
see how it all kind of shakes out and

144
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,579
who the winners are that emerge but you

145
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,889
know as this industry matures and more

146
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,408
cultivation comes online the margins

147
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,848
compress and distribution is not a very

148
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:53,279
easy game right when you have to do it

149
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:56,939
in this regulatory landscape tons of

150
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,219
rules very high capex investments on the

151
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,180
real estate on the truck side so you

152
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,979
know I think what we're gonna see this

153
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,949
year is is you know unfortunately

154
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:06,719
probably some distributors you know

155
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,939
disappearing or joining forces with

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,620
other people because it's definitely not

157
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,620
enough room for the number of

158
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,519
distributors that exist today so that's

159
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,720
one of the things that we're working on

160
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,399
consciously is actually trying to come

161
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,259
together with a lot of distribution

162
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,788
companies and kind of protect the

163
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,710
California values and the california

164
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:24,389
brands that for so long I've been part

165
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:29,008
of this industry and finding ways to

166
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:30,720
work together more intimately well I

167
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,030
think it's difficult to talk about the

168
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,969
distribution environment in 2019 without

169
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:38,218
going back to 2017 because

170
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:39,839
notwithstanding the comment I say to

171
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:40,620
people all the time were like any other

172
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,888
distribution

173
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,300
company in any other industry in 2017 we

174
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,370
couldn't be like any other distribution

175
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,750
company because if we distribute it and

176
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,879
actually distributed that was called

177
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,579
trafficking that was very illegal so

178
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,060
instead what we did was we formed mutual

179
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,948
benefit corporations cooperatives

180
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,410
nonprofit we facilitated transaction

181
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,750
amongst members member patients of the

182
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:08,250
collective try putting that on your link

183
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:10,949
done I tried and and so we had this the

184
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,680
that was the downside the upside was we

185
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:16,169
had a couple of thousand potential

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,579
clients to sell to in terms of retailers

187
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:20,159
and dispensary and delivery services

188
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:24,120
then on one one 2018

189
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,880
boom that got cut by about 75% to just a

190
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,579
few hundred that type of tumult was very

191
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,350
difficult to navigate and as we reorient

192
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,418
it our business and reorder the brands

193
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,910
and so forth towards now this segment

194
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:38,339
started building those we got to July

195
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:42,870
1st the date all of us will remember

196
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:44,369
here the BCC told retailers ok as of

197
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,560
July 1 if we catch you with any

198
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,098
non-compliant inventory you're in

199
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,668
trouble

200
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:53,009
well hilarity ensued because 350 are so

201
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:55,529
licensed retailers each had a different

202
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,839
opinion as to what compliant inventory

203
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:00,929
was is that appropriate contrasting

204
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,478
color is that the lower third and so

205
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,478
forth and so navigating all of that and

206
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,129
then we almost had it again at the end

207
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,750
of the year with a heavy metal testing

208
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,310
where let's test all products for heavy

209
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,930
metal but let's only have a few labs

210
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,788
that are really up to the task

211
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,769
so these are the things that we dealt

212
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:19,620
with in 2018 now that we're getting to

213
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:21,448
2019 we've overcome those we now have

214
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,949
permanent regulations it's interesting

215
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,079
most people think permanent means

216
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,579
they're not going to change permanent in

217
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,990
this case means they're gonna change but

218
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:30,180
apparently a little bit more slowly

219
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,660
according to the BCC and that's a good

220
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,719
thing

221
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,000
so I think all of the things that that

222
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,919
my fellow distributor on the right said

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,110
is exactly right work we're gonna see

224
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,088
increased competition we're gonna see

225
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,070
the types of things that probably would

226
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,060
have expected last year but we were just

227
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,060
dealing with the tumult

228
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,200
if no other comments we can move on to

229
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,610
the next question which is related so

230
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,600
what are some of your big takeaways from

231
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:02,870
2018 really as it pertains to what makes

232
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,690
a winning partnership between producers

233
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,580
and distributors and/or retailers and

234
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,660
distributors so really thinking about it

235
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,730
from a perspective of what makes

236
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,949
partnerships work in this new

237
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,720
environment that we are all in in a new

238
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,720
new regulated environment with all those

239
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,540
changes that Westley outlined Felipe

240
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,040
would you like to start sure so we look

241
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:30,649
at partnership very much so that we are

242
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,569
in this lane of distribution and brands

243
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,090
can focus on their manufacturing or

244
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,580
their cultivation and so for us being

245
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,310
able to provide the services with a very

246
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,950
specific focus and being the most

247
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:45,319
efficient partner possible we're

248
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,230
flexible around the partnership so if

249
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,240
brands want to represent themselves

250
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,180
we're of the belief that nobody tells

251
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,799
their story better than themselves so we

252
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,539
allow the brands to go out and build

253
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,669
their sales teams and and wrap

254
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:00,199
themselves and and if they're ready to

255
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:03,229
share the story and allow us to go out

256
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,810
and represent them we've got sales as a

257
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,940
service and we'll build a team we really

258
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,979
get to know the brand we know what what

259
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,040
what drives them what their DNA is like

260
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,550
and and we're out on the field wearing

261
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:22,370
their gear day in and day out we have a

262
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:25,669
lot of pride in that so I think it's

263
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,620
just furthering Felipe's comments it's

264
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,829
also understanding that we have our own

265
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,269
very specific and respect to function

266
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,160
but at the same time we're all basically

267
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:37,360
standing there on the same team and so

268
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,789
what that means is we don't look at why

269
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,110
this person should be in a store and

270
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,719
this person should not be in a store

271
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,789
it's really making sure that whatever it

272
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,720
is that you put together as a plan is

273
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:53,269
very well defined and well executed I

274
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,710
think it's the main point is making sure

275
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,289
that everybody is relying on their core

276
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,940
competencies and that you

277
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:01,448
I will understand what those respective

278
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,399
core companies competencies are and that

279
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:05,439
also means we work together a lot so we

280
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,289
call each other we end up you know

281
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,990
working with different clients after SB

282
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,698
311 passed Thank You Lauren we've been

283
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,129
able to do distributor to distributor

284
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:16,719
transactions so it's opened up to some

285
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:18,458
of the like the local aggregators and

286
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,920
various regions of the state that are

287
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,659
further out to partner up source get

288
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,568
everything retail ready and then we do

289
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:28,838
the last mile delivery for them any

290
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:33,669
other big takeaways in terms of what

291
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:35,560
makes a winning partnership well we

292
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:36,698
could probably do the entire panel on

293
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,008
that but I think it's really

294
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:41,588
understanding and I'm building on what

295
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,110
Philippe it said it's mutual dependence

296
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,660
no matter how good a distributor is at

297
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,889
logistics it's out of business if it

298
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,740
doesn't have good products and it

299
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,329
doesn't make those products so brands

300
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,299
have a tremendous amount of leverage on

301
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:57,879
that that said if a brand has products

302
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:00,278
and it's not in a dispensary and does

303
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,039
not have a good footprint in those

304
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:07,088
dispensaries it's out of business so is

305
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,948
really looking for the areas where they

306
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,810
can work together and collaborate I

307
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:12,698
think the number one thing a distributor

308
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,528
should ask its brands is how can we do a

309
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,389
better job of representing your products

310
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:18,549
the number one thing the brands should

311
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:20,230
ask their distributors is what are you

312
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:22,208
hearing from dispensaries about our

313
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,190
products our packaging our messaging

314
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:28,119
that we can improve to make your job

315
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,730
easier great thank you

316
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,328
let's talk about what is a distributors

317
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,039
role in the supply chain beyond some of

318
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:38,409
the kind of logistical and functional

319
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:41,289
things that you've mentioned and kind of

320
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:43,208
around the idea of their role in terms

321
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:46,480
of creating demand is that a

322
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:47,919
distributors role to create demand or

323
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,509
does that fall more on the brand or is

324
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,929
it is it a shared effort if you could

325
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,929
speak to that

326
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,799
sure I mean I think to the point made

327
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,820
earlier there's there's different kinds

328
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,019
of relationships with the different

329
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,600
brands and different distributors have

330
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:04,399
different models I think you know

331
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,460
besides the logistics besides the sale

332
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,379
besides transportation warehousing that

333
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,540
the traditional functions you know we're

334
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,759
also you know this state's tax

335
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:15,799
collection agency I consider ourselves

336
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,299
also kind of an information hub we kind

337
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,279
of sit in the middle of cultivators

338
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:20,990
manufacturers retailers delivery

339
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,309
services we know all of those pain

340
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,720
points and we take it upon ourselves to

341
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,909
you know really help all the other

342
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,230
pieces of the supply chain on some of

343
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,719
the trade organizations that we sit on

344
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:35,529
the boards CCIA

345
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:37,460
and the others I think in general the

346
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,399
relationship with a distributor to

347
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,190
really build marketplace speaking about

348
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,779
ourselves we're not trying to be a large

349
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,070
catalogue distributor with thousands of

350
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:47,509
products we want to build an intimate

351
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,210
relationship with a select few of

352
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:52,159
curated you know category winning brands

353
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,690
and you know we try to find and

354
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:58,189
associate ourselves with brands that for

355
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:59,840
one can scale a lot of people are

356
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,400
struggling with scaling beyond the real

357
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,379
estate that they're in or with lack of

358
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,629
capital so we finally find the right

359
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,879
brands that have that ability to scale

360
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,529
and if they don't have in themselves we

361
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,049
love the brand or love the founding team

362
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,980
we try to help them with the capital we

363
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,889
try to help them with our real estate

364
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,779
footprint as well I think in terms of

365
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,159
developing the marketplace you know we

366
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,449
do have a very close relationship with

367
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,709
the brands where we actually help them

368
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,960
with a lot of the marketing activities

369
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,060
we run merchandising teams we ran brand

370
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,500
ambassador teams for them we have

371
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:29,359
specific campaigns that we do together

372
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,100
collaboratively with collaboratively

373
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,110
with them you know a distributors

374
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,690
success really depends entirely on the

375
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,460
brand right you're linked by the hip and

376
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,270
I think it's very important for that

377
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,650
relationship to be kind of win-win and

378
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,789
the distributors in our case that we are

379
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,319
building a lot of market share for the

380
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,699
brands we work with but we also leverage

381
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,830
a lot of their marketing campaigns that

382
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,310
they do I'm not sure if all the other

383
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,650
distributors are the same let's go say

384
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,379
aside from the tax collection we have

385
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,759
another huge responsibility is to make

386
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,830
sure that the products are safe for the

387
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,149
consumers so we're doing all of the

388
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,490
Quality Assurance making sure it's

389
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:05,689
labeled appropriately and in compliant

390
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,539
packaging

391
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,060
market other responsibilities and

392
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:13,099
functions that we have is to actually

393
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:15,289
give back the brands that we work with

394
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,820
analytics visibility to what's happening

395
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,429
in the marketplace so that they can make

396
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,960
the right decisions about what their an

397
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:24,199
excuse should be or how much inventory

398
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,940
to have on hand or what their the next

399
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,040
you know any demand based analytics that

400
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,800
could help them drive their businesses

401
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:33,379
success yeah one thing really worth

402
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,659
emphasizing is and we're very proud of

403
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,090
our distribution company but no at no

404
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:40,850
time ever in the history of the cannabis

405
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,680
industry has anybody ever walked into a

406
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,750
dispensary and said I would like a

407
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,399
mammoth distribution product what

408
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,289
mammoth distribution products do have I

409
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,639
understand their logistics is amazing

410
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:54,199
so we're there behind the scenes we know

411
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,629
we need to get it in we need to have the

412
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,850
footprint we need to educate but at the

413
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,439
end of the day it is the power of the

414
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,450
brand because you might be able to get

415
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,920
somebody to try something once and often

416
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,230
we're not able to get something in a

417
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,000
dispensary without the bud tenders and

418
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,680
the managers and the buyers trying it go

419
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,659
and you know what I like this and I

420
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,219
think other people will like it and you

421
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,779
can get people potentially to try

422
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,090
something once but if they don't come

423
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,019
back and ask for it then you're not

424
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,700
going to be able to keep it in that

425
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,319
dispensary and then it's gonna be very

426
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,410
hard to get it into other dispensaries

427
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,480
so it was going to go back as first and

428
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:28,519
foremost just have a great product it

429
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,440
has to be compliant because otherwise it

430
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,840
doesn't even get in retailers have

431
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,820
gotten very good and being very

432
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,670
discerning to the point of being kind of

433
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,500
crazy in some cases but to make sure

434
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:41,149
that they feel that it's past every

435
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,750
single aspect of what they consider

436
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:47,149
compliant I would just echo whatever's

437
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:50,480
what everyone else has said it's

438
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:52,429
effectively being a leveraging platform

439
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,430
or an enabling platform I should say so

440
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:58,549
one of the things that PACs did is we

441
00:16:54,429 --> 00:17:00,949
sponsored a large consumption event and

442
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:02,449
we paid for every one of our brands to

443
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,309
come down or every single one of our

444
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,110
brands to come down and sit in front of

445
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,509
the consumers so we sponsored the

446
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,000
Emerald cup and we paid for all of our

447
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:13,939
all 21 brands that we represent to sit

448
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,588
there we covered the expense of that

449
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:18,019
event so that they could be there in

450
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:19,250
front of all of their consumers and get

451
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,139
that real-time feedback

452
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,328
to understand what the market really is

453
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,860
what the consumers are looking for the

454
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:27,318
dialog between the consumers and the

455
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,649
retailers and being able to do that I

456
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:33,678
think in various ways across platforms

457
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,990
across the state it's really that's what

458
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,640
we do as distributors beyond all of the

459
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,558
other technicalities that we have to do

460
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,750
it's really being a leveraging platform

461
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:47,839
great so so what advice do you have for

462
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,909
brands in terms of getting them ready

463
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,529
for distribution so I'm sure you you

464
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:53,059
know brands reach out our producers

465
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,190
reach out and they are looking for a

466
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:57,740
distributor and they may or may not be a

467
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,950
right fit for you based on whatever

468
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,079
criteria you have so what would you tell

469
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,480
brands that you look for and that you

470
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:15,259
expect before they're really ready for a

471
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:17,000
distribution partner I think I guess the

472
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,460
first advice would be make sure you like

473
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,450
your distribution partner you know at

474
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,548
the end of the day companies are built

475
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,259
with people and you got to make sure you

476
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,490
get along well with that organization

477
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:26,658
and your kind of value aligned and

478
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,440
mission the line and kind of what you're

479
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:31,909
trying to achieve you know one thing we

480
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,470
know for certain in this industry it's

481
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,539
that even though we're in this permanent

482
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,548
regulation phase it's gonna change and

483
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:38,990
change and change and change you're

484
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:41,029
gonna have problem after problem after

485
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,980
hiccup after hiccup and you have to work

486
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:44,089
through those you know we've had a lot

487
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,190
of challenges with packaging and

488
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,970
labeling and different changes and

489
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,250
different perspective from different

490
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,419
dispensaries and working through those

491
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,548
and I think is one of the most important

492
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:55,280
things you can do I think from a

493
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:57,769
distributor perspective picking the

494
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,808
right one that has this scale to really

495
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,460
serve you know the entire state or

496
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:03,529
specific regions if you want to divvy it

497
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,269
up with different people making sure

498
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:07,970
they have the right amount of capital to

499
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,369
continue to grow distribution is a super

500
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,900
capital intensive game and especially to

501
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:14,000
do it at scale at the pace that

502
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,880
California needs it so I think ensuring

503
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,319
that the distributor that you choose is

504
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,730
gonna be around for the long term and

505
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,689
you know you're working with people that

506
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,120
you kind of want to work with on a day

507
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,000
to day basis so you know two simple

508
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,859
rules and do your homework distributors

509
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,929
are different and so if you're going to

510
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:32,729
a distributor and their emphasis upon

511
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:35,790
the medicinal and yours is on the party

512
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,710
it might not be a good fit make sure if

513
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,859
you're bringing a product to them that

514
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,569
your packaging is compliant because if

515
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:44,699
you come in and it's got all sorts of

516
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:45,990
medical claims and so forth they're

517
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,299
gonna think this is going to be a lot

518
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,099
more work working with these people make

519
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,319
sure your product has been tested before

520
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,000
and coming in because the one thing

521
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,059
about distributors the distribution

522
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,880
model generally as a number is a sort of

523
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,679
a game of a lot of numbers you carry a

524
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,850
number of brands a number of different

525
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,890
SKUs that means you're dealing with a

526
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:07,439
lot of different people and competing

527
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,350
interests and if one tries to be the

528
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,940
tall blade and dominate the time it

529
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,949
really can make it difficult for

530
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,620
everything else so I think what he says

531
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,690
is exactly right never underestimate the

532
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,039
people concept somebody might like your

533
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,150
product but as you're leaving they're

534
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,440
sitting there thinking I don't want to

535
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,009
have to deal with this guy or this gal

536
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,600
that's not going to serve you well I

537
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:29,940
would recommend having a business plan a

538
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,240
lot of people slap a label on a package

539
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,830
and say this is my brand so actually you

540
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,140
know have some forecasting figure out

541
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:39,059
how much inventory have projections of

542
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,259
what you'd like to sell when you get out

543
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,069
to market and that will help all of us

544
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,289
second the packaging because the

545
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:47,970
majority of packaging that comes through

546
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,769
shows up the first revision they've

547
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,100
already ordered tons of it and we're

548
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:54,750
looking at it and it's all wrong so hire

549
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,539
an attorney have them look at the

550
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,279
packaging or get a compliance person and

551
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,779
then come talk to a distributor make

552
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,029
sure that they approve your packaging

553
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,920
and then the big final thing that I

554
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:07,319
would say if you want to go to market is

555
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,660
read the regulations or at least have

556
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,669
somebody that read them because a lot of

557
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,710
companies have not read them and we

558
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,870
spend a lot of time educating the

559
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:19,620
companies or the brands to work with

560
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:21,599
them yeah I would agree with what

561
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,919
everyone has said the other component

562
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,809
would be really think about what you're

563
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,230
getting ready to do if you are launching

564
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:30,419
a brand that's not just a brand you need

565
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,220
to create a message you need to create a

566
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,769
vision you need to communicate that out

567
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,380
to the market and again going back to

568
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:40,170
the enabling platform you create

569
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,640
marketing plans for your products you

570
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,320
pull your distributor into that

571
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,120
particularly when you're receiving some

572
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:48,980
sort of sales service from them

573
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,779
what we noticed on the front end when we

574
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,029
brought on a lot of the small legacy

575
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,259
farmers the small batch farmers is that

576
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,119
we were investing somewhere between

577
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:58,038
twenty and forty thousand dollars per

578
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,389
brand that we brought on just trying to

579
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:01,788
build momentum for them in the

580
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,259
marketplace and that takes time and

581
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:05,419
that's another thing that needs to be

582
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:07,429
understood from people you know from

583
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,470
brands or from entities that are trying

584
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,960
to create brands in the market is that

585
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,880
this is a heavily congested space

586
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,429
everybody is here attempting to sell

587
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,500
cannabis and you need to not only have

588
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:21,048
these differentiators and so on but you

589
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,730
also need to have a message that will

590
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:25,069
resonate and you have to understand that

591
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,200
for something to resonate it takes time

592
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:31,038
X amount of impressions for the someone

593
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,590
to recall that's a process so you expect

594
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,089
to show up to a distributor on say a

595
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:37,129
Friday and they're gonna pick up your

596
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:40,069
inventory don't expect sales on Monday

597
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,140
it's I mean it and that happens a lot

598
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:44,990
you know hey you guys have had my

599
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,520
product for three days now what's what's

600
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,960
going on you know what's the market

601
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,029
what's going you know what's the market

602
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:56,210
intelligence where's my money where's my

603
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:57,710
money yeah it's at the state the the big

604
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,659
thing is making sure that there's a plan

605
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,390
going back to some of the earlier

606
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:04,100
comments that were made you've got to

607
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,190
really show up with a plan you have to

608
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:09,469
understand that this is a team it's it

609
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,750
is a huge team of effort it is a huge

610
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,250
team event if you're gonna have a

611
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,990
marketing plan communicate that to your

612
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,690
distributor because they can show up and

613
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,329
they can be the sales team that backs up

614
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,919
whatever collateral media that you're

615
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,869
putting out there this is all

616
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,370
coordinated efforts and that's one of

617
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,859
the things that distributors have to do

618
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:29,689
we do the education we do the review we

619
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:32,209
do the compliance check we do logistics

620
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,429
we do hand-holding we do everything to

621
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,548
get something to market the best way to

622
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:39,380
see a distributor is a synthesizer and

623
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:40,819
we have to take chaos and we have to

624
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,000
turn it into something palatable and

625
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:46,308
adjustable on the retail side and it's

626
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,269
it's a process and understand that it's

627
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:51,048
something that needs to be worked

628
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:53,089
through yeah there's so many different

629
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:56,298
ways to go about this and there's only a

630
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:58,149
handful of them that are correct so so

631
00:23:56,298 --> 00:24:01,099
you've all alluded to various stuff

632
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,919
services and value propositions that

633
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:06,649
these different business models have and

634
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,259
may offer there's certainly a selection

635
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,240
of different services depending on the

636
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:15,379
distributor a brand might go and work

637
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,079
with so how do we place a value on those

638
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,730
services as a whole or individually I

639
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,970
know some business models are kind of

640
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,919
ala carte you know and you can leverage

641
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,538
certain aspects of what a distributor

642
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,400
has to offer and others are more

643
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:32,179
comprehensive in terms of a flat rate

644
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,360
for kind of the whole package and so you

645
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,070
know I've heard rates anywhere from five

646
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:41,000
to ten percent when you're talking about

647
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:43,339
just straight transportation you know 10

648
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,460
to 20 percent if it's a combination of

649
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:51,379
transport and warehousing logistics and

650
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:54,230
as high as 20 25 30 percent for that

651
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:58,190
full-service warehousing logistics and

652
00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:00,470
sales and brand support so how would you

653
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:04,250
say what would you say is the

654
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,400
appropriate value for those services and

655
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,690
to give people an expectation of what

656
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,110
how they would approach a conversation

657
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:14,600
with a distributor but also how to

658
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:15,949
evaluate one distributor from the next

659
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:21,889
based on the service that they're

660
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:25,779
getting I think that should be answered

661
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,780
by anyone other than me right now I

662
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:32,538
think one of the first things is is

663
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,509
making sure that you Felipe's point

664
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:38,200
understand the rules and then ask your

665
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:41,119
distributor if they understand the rules

666
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,669
there's many times where we've had to

667
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,859
explain the law to another distributor

668
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:48,590
and I think what you should do is find

669
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:50,569
certain points that you want to ask them

670
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:54,139
you need to do a competency test I'm

671
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:56,269
basically trusting this person - I'm

672
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,159
putting my my well being in this

673
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:59,500
person's hands I have done everything I

674
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,429
can to create a high-quality

675
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,859
representation of what I believe is the

676
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:06,080
best product out there and I'm going to

677
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:07,849
give you the best of what I've got how

678
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,490
do I know whether or not you can give me

679
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,719
the best that I expect you know that you

680
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,278
can reciprocate

681
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,929
and you have to be able to know that

682
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,519
these people are technically competent

683
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,470
you shouldn't have to question whether

684
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,649
or not they can do logistics if they

685
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:25,610
can't do logistics and that should be a

686
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:27,258
short conversation from there I think

687
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,808
it's really understanding there their

688
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:31,460
sales makeup you know what is it that

689
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:33,700
they can do for me on the sales front

690
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,079
are they gonna provide demo services and

691
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,850
recognizing how much of that you need to

692
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,939
lean on them for and how much of that

693
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:43,069
you plan to do yourself it's it's really

694
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,620
a negotiation you should see it as an

695
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:47,450
open negotiation saying you know I'm

696
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:49,489
gonna bring you know I the brand I'm

697
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:54,740
gonna bring my sales team and I just

698
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:57,019
need your demo but I'd say you're gonna

699
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,480
see price points start to get a little

700
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:00,649
bit more competitive and it's hard to

701
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,389
say whether or not they'll go up or down

702
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:03,678
I think with the consolidation that's

703
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:05,508
gonna happen you're gonna see some of

704
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,830
them go up because a lot of the

705
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:08,990
technical technically proficient

706
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:11,480
operators are gonna do are gonna remain

707
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,700
in those that are not proficient we're

708
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,110
gonna disappear and that space is gonna

709
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,860
get a lot more complicated as we

710
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:20,808
continue to evolve this this marketplace

711
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:22,490
there's gonna be more retail outlets

712
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:24,440
it's gonna be more delivery services and

713
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,000
eventually there's going to be long

714
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,860
hauls headed out to other states and

715
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,669
really at the end of the day you want to

716
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:34,369
understand how capable that team is that

717
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:41,059
you're relying on and if they are

718
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:42,709
competent you should really it's it's

719
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:44,058
actually pretty hard to explain how many

720
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,889
different things the distributors have

721
00:27:44,058 --> 00:27:49,730
to do that really a brand doesn't see on

722
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:51,469
a daily basis but expect that when you

723
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,000
walk into these negotiations that number

724
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,899
is going to land somewhere around 20 to

725
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,298
25% for full service that's what you

726
00:27:56,898 --> 00:28:00,979
should show up with as a budget 25

727
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:02,808
percent should be what you expect in the

728
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:08,538
middle and anything that you get below

729
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:11,240
that is a win I would say look at the

730
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:13,519
contract so after you've gotten to see

731
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,899
the facility meet some of the team look

732
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,788
over their distribution services

733
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:18,949
agreement you can tell a lot about a

734
00:28:16,788 --> 00:28:20,240
company just by reading that agreement

735
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,690
we've actually talked about

736
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,370
standardizing the distribution contracts

737
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,840
so it's very easy for

738
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:28,939
you to read and compare distributor to

739
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:32,750
distributor so hopefully that'll happen

740
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,600
in the upcoming year or this year and so

741
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,150
that would be probably another great

742
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,740
thing if we can all have just like real

743
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,720
estate where you look at the formants in

744
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,730
the same place no matter which mortgage

745
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,100
company you worked with or which realtor

746
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,860
you worked with it's also important to

747
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,329
note that if your brand is doing a

748
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,669
hundred thousand dollars a month that

749
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:54,829
maybe even taking fifty percent the

750
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,450
person's going to be losing yet if

751
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:58,819
you're doing a couple of million dollars

752
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:02,090
a month it might be ten percent is too

753
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:04,369
much so kind of either breaking it out

754
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:06,829
so there's flat fees or there's breaks

755
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:09,979
on percentages or so forth and again a

756
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:12,259
lot of it really depends on how much

757
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,519
work you're asking them to do the reason

758
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,629
I was dodging the question a little

759
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,759
earlier is we have a little bit

760
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,820
different model and it certainly I gotta

761
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,879
say it's a better model or an inferior

762
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:24,349
model it's just the one we take which is

763
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,900
every brand that we work with we've

764
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:29,659
invested in and taken an equity position

765
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,340
one is because we want them to have the

766
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,170
resources because if we're out there

767
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:35,269
distributing and we go to them and say

768
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,800
it'd be great if you did XYZ we don't

769
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,210
want to look across the table and say

770
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,129
well we don't have the money go sell

771
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,049
some stuff and then we can do it the

772
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,450
second and the more important thing is

773
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:47,119
that we wanted the long term interest to

774
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,950
be aligned and so we want to make it

775
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,219
where if they're successful we're

776
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:56,630
successful

777
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:58,339
similarly if they're cut we believe as a

778
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,020
distributor sometimes what happens I

779
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:01,579
call this the distribution paradox for

780
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:03,920
brands a distributor goes in there

781
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:05,659
carrying your brand and the dispensary

782
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,370
says you know what we don't think we're

783
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,870
going to carry this one but we're going

784
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:10,759
to carry this other one from you well

785
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,909
for that salesperson there they've made

786
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:15,769
their Commission and it's really tough

787
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:18,050
on them to say no no no thank you for

788
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,789
that order but so forth because they're

789
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:23,119
just trying to keep that footprint and

790
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:25,069
so forth and yet from the brands point

791
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,169
of view you don't want the distributor

792
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:28,669
to come back oh good news bad news bad

793
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,019
news is they're not carrying you anymore

794
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,269
good news is they're carrying something

795
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:34,730
else we distribute so that's how we went

796
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:36,500
ahead and tried to address it others

797
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,190
have addressed it in other ways but we

798
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,500
look again to take make an investment in

799
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,120
session it just occurred to me that you

800
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,460
should also look at their brand

801
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,139
portfolio let's see how you rank amongst

802
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,309
the other brands that they carry does it

803
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,380
make sense for you to work with this

804
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,299
distributor do they have other brands

805
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,930
that would keep you know cannibalize

806
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:57,849
that piece of your business and I would

807
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:01,660
add that 20 to 25 percent numbers for a

808
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:04,119
brand new brand without any history if

809
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,680
you have history as stated that

810
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:07,989
obviously gives you a great deal more

811
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,090
leverage and negotiating power and it

812
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:14,740
also makes things a lot more cut-and-dry

813
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:17,109
for the distributor so to that end you

814
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,380
should really do whatever you can to see

815
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:23,649
what demand there is for your product in

816
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,660
the market and then start talking to

817
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,730
distributors again as well you don't

818
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,440
want to show up without a very good

819
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,450
understanding or at least some form of

820
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,460
context for your brand in the market

821
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,220
because we have people that show up and

822
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,420
they had some contracted product that

823
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,880
they don't really know about and don't

824
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:44,529
believe in and we just they're like okay

825
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,710
make this big maybe talk to somebody

826
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,710
else

827
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:54,120
all right well our kind of last question

828
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:56,250
and then we'll open it up for some QA

829
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,259
what role do you think that California

830
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,779
brands and distributors will have in

831
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:04,690
this kind of national and global market

832
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:07,230
that is emerging and you know what do

833
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,360
you think that timeline looks like now

834
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,670
do you personally have a vision for that

835
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,990
for your company or some of the brands

836
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,750
you work with like what's the

837
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:20,470
conversation right now around expanding

838
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:24,240
state to state the concept of interstate

839
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:26,470
commerce opening up and even even global

840
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,450
obviously ideally we'd want interstate

841
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,160
commerce to open up because we have one

842
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,710
of the greatest producing states in the

843
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,259
nation but for now since we have to work

844
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,940
within the confines of each state and in

845
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:38,049
the regulations California has

846
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,000
established by one of the best

847
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:42,039
frameworks when you look at the

848
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,259
regulations in the other states this one

849
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:46,740
was clearly guided by people that have

850
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:49,869
been in the industry for a long time and

851
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,430
we have a vision for being able to have

852
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,869
a platform to take your brand into

853
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,720
multiple

854
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:57,359
States so if you're produced here and

855
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,250
distributed here to provide that same

856
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,808
experience in another state that's

857
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,700
something that if you want to build a

858
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,839
big national brand you need so from

859
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,390
distribution I think we have a

860
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:11,399
responsibility to build that multi-state

861
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:13,740
platform yet stated simply California is

862
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,259
the largest and I think most important

863
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,019
cannabis market in the world it is what

864
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:22,319
Hollywood is two movies what New York

865
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:25,740
City is to publishing what Paris and

866
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,049
Rome is to fashion and so if you can

867
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,329
it's a very big an expensive and

868
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:31,859
difficult state to win but if you can

869
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:33,299
that will help you in the other states

870
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:35,490
that will help you in other countries

871
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:39,178
more than let's say having a winning

872
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:41,730
brand in Massachusetts or Florida and

873
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:43,650
then bring it in into California and so

874
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,179
on a pragmatic basis that means as

875
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,730
you're allocating if you're in multiple

876
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:50,100
states and you're allocating marketing

877
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,079
budgets it's worth to allocate more to

878
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:53,909
California than you might otherwise do

879
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,829
because it really will help in your

880
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,920
licensing and we see that on the basis

881
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:01,529
of just in two folds one is the number

882
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,210
of queries that we get from other states

883
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:04,619
people wanting to license and there was

884
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,569
somebody from bang earlier this morning

885
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,889
and people were saying we want to

886
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:09,569
license you and he said well that's

887
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,740
great but why do you want us and they

888
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,600
said because people asked for your

889
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:18,719
product in this other state and that

890
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:20,369
speaks volumes yeah I think some of the

891
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,769
sentiments here at California for sure

892
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:24,739
is the most important market of the

893
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:27,059
nation and you know probably the world

894
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:29,250
California also produces two-thirds of

895
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,750
the nation's fruits and vegetables so I

896
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,659
think when state white borders come down

897
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,648
all cultivation moves down here

898
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,929
manufacturing moves to California too

899
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:38,159
you don't want to be shipping biomass to

900
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,418
other states to be manufactured

901
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,070
everything will be really close to the

902
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,529
biomass and the way we think about

903
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:45,870
national expansion is hyper focused on

904
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,730
California we're building massive scale

905
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,259
on our upstream operations building

906
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,219
relationships with the farmers helping

907
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,750
them a lot with their accounting

908
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,969
services or compliance services their

909
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,639
legal services we've also partnered with

910
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,559
an amazing lab called Cascadia labs and

911
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,390
our facility and offering really large

912
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,980
bulk discounts to our farmers so finding

913
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:04,289
ways for them to stay in the ecosystem

914
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,670
and building that infrastructure so that

915
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:08,068
when the states do come online

916
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,318
or the statewide borders do go off or do

917
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:12,210
disappear we're ready for that national

918
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:14,548
expansion right in the portfolio that

919
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,650
we're building is a very curated set of

920
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:19,079
very desirable California brands that

921
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,210
have California values at heart that

922
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,519
want to support the sun-grown ecosystem

923
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,929
the small farmer ecosystem really the

924
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,150
people that kind of built this industry

925
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,769
and we feel that building that really

926
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,599
large portfolio here in California

927
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:32,489
putting those in the top-ranking spots

928
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,480
across all their categories and really

929
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:35,969
waiting for that moment

930
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,568
I think the Canadian public markets have

931
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:40,858
created an artificial market dynamics

932
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:43,108
where people think they can put flags in

933
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:44,818
other states and use that to raise more

934
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,838
money and raise more capital I think a

935
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:47,849
lot of people are going to be cut with a

936
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,828
lot of little small little assets in a

937
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,088
bunch of little locations and not really

938
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:52,589
building for the scale when the time

939
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:55,409
comes and that's what we're really

940
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:58,190
focused on I would say us goes

941
00:35:55,409 --> 00:36:01,440
California so goes the rest of the world

942
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:04,190
and that's what we kind of promised a

943
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,818
lot of our business design on

944
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:08,818
understanding that once we get

945
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:11,369
California dialed in we can pretty well

946
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:12,750
assume that whatever structures adopted

947
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,338
at the federal level is probably going

948
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,230
to look somewhat similar to California

949
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,659
we are developing the precedent this is

950
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,568
the opportunity to establish a very

951
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:23,489
large system that allows us to prove it

952
00:36:21,568 --> 00:36:25,980
to provide proof of concept to the

953
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:29,009
federal government and likely we'll have

954
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,838
a fair segment of it adopted at the

955
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,240
federal level so for our operation we

956
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,469
are designed to scale not only

957
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,899
nationally but internationally

958
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:38,399
what we did is invested heavily on our

959
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,950
warehouse management system on the front

960
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,559
end ensuring that the ability to scale

961
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:47,818
is not limited by our systems but merely

962
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:50,460
by our creativity I want to say thank

963
00:36:47,818 --> 00:36:53,880
you to our panelists all members of the

964
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,329
cannabis distribution Association we

965
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,849
have Pacific Expeditors rise logistics

966
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:01,019
mammoth distribution and flow kana so I

967
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:03,450
encourage you to reach out to these

968
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,920
folks and do we have time for questions

969
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:08,519
we have time for one or two quick

970
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,818
questions all right I see you Kris here

971
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:15,088
I come on my way here I go caller are

972
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:16,710
you there thank you great panel Chris

973
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:18,750
Conrad here I'm just wondering in terms

974
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,349
of distribution system do we see the

975
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,530
same kind of

976
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:24,059
competition for shelf space in the

977
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,430
Cannabis introduce you like see at the

978
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:27,929
grocery stores or whatever where they're

979
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:29,730
fighting for that right at the exit and

980
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:31,859
so forth and and how does that work out

981
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,940
and distributor versus people trying to

982
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,490
go on their own and so forth I just like

983
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,230
to address that thank you

984
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:40,559
there's nothing preventing slotting in

985
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,990
the regulations so yes shelf space is

986
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,699
being bought and sold and traded and all

987
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:47,219
sorts of things it's extremely

988
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:50,219
competitive I also look at it like the

989
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,719
the almost like the pharma super forma

990
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:52,259
suitable reps that would go and hit a

991
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:54,029
doctor

992
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,160
you've got to think there's almost one

993
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,860
distributor for every retail store right

994
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:01,099
now so if I were gonna say anything that

995
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,559
we need to focus on in California and

996
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:06,000
2019 it's bring on more retail we have a

997
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:10,110
lot of consumers we need a lot more

998
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,059
retail in a really small footprint in

999
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,559
the stores it's not like a grocery store

1000
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:15,840
though you have a lot of shelf space to

1001
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:20,460
offer to begin with so the footprints

1002
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:22,440
much smaller question over here it seems

1003
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,349
like more and more distributors are sort

1004
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,730
of building their own proprietary

1005
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:29,579
technologies it seems as you said

1006
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,289
there's a tremendous amount of expense

1007
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,449
is already with being a distributor and

1008
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:35,460
even more trying to build your own

1009
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:36,989
proprietary software where do you sort

1010
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,940
of bridge the gap between what you build

1011
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:39,750
yourselves and what you buy I mean my

1012
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,610
assumption is you want to be a

1013
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,610
distributor now not a software company

1014
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,500
that's an interesting question actually

1015
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,880
and we took a very unique and different

1016
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,039
approach from day one to actually bring

1017
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,480
a lot of our technology in-house I think

1018
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,460
to your point for sure people that are

1019
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,630
doing purely distribution there's a lot

1020
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,970
of software out there that does

1021
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,490
warehouse management route optimization

1022
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:04,139
whatever whatever you call it for us

1023
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:05,339
specifically and you know I definitely

1024
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:07,980
wanna speak for the for the crowd

1025
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,900
we're very deeply connected with the our

1026
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,309
supply chain and our partners so we have

1027
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,869
a lot of technology and a lot of tools

1028
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:15,420
for our farmers to onboard their

1029
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:16,679
inventory to view their inventory to see

1030
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,269
what products are selling in which

1031
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,099
locations and which stores in which

1032
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:22,739
regions we give them ideas of what to

1033
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:24,420
grow we want to try to turn our supply

1034
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:26,309
chain to being what it is today that

1035
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,570
farmers grow whatever they want and then

1036
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:29,489
we have to figure out how to sell it and

1037
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,620
we want to basically use our data and

1038
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:32,928
our tools to really inform the upstream

1039
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,759
production

1040
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:36,289
so that we're actually doing demand

1041
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:38,568
production rather than whatever the

1042
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:40,309
farmer wants so we built a lot of our

1043
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:42,318
technology in the house you know the way

1044
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:43,759
we kind of look at business and

1045
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:45,228
generally at flow kana as we look at the

1046
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:46,639
world and we make our own hypothesis

1047
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:48,739
sometimes those hypotheses are proven

1048
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,409
and disproven and we look ahead and try

1049
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:53,389
to kind of figure out what the next

1050
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:55,129
bottlenecks are right lab testing was a

1051
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:56,389
huge bottleneck that we have in this

1052
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,640
initiative a that's why we made a deep

1053
00:39:56,389 --> 00:40:00,078
partnership with a lab I see technology

1054
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,058
and a lot of this software's out there

1055
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,979
attracting multiple states and multiple

1056
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:05,599
jurisdictions and multiple regulations

1057
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:06,708
so we always thought that technology was

1058
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,499
gonna be very hard for us to scale

1059
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:10,909
especially how complex our model is to

1060
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:12,948
really be able to depend on other people

1061
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:15,139
to make the the changes that California

1062
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:18,079
will require so specifically for us

1063
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:19,998
because we're so deeply connected to our

1064
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,890
farmer base all the way to our retailers

1065
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:25,098
it made a lot of strategic sense for us

1066
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:27,228
to build our own stuff we felt a little

1067
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:28,669
bit similar tacked and a little bit

1068
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:31,458
different from some of them probably

1069
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:35,268
smarter people on this panel than me but

1070
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:37,368
it is very hard to be a good distributor

1071
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:39,798
and so we felt we should put the focus

1072
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:43,849
in that the same way that I don't think

1073
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:47,150
I would go to a Microsoft and ask them

1074
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:49,880
to distribute cannabis so we look for

1075
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,818
people who their sole focus is

1076
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,289
developing amazing software and then

1077
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:58,219
look to leverage and work on their

1078
00:40:54,289 --> 00:41:01,099
efforts and I have the opposite take so

1079
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:02,749
if you work with a software company and

1080
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:05,329
a product manager to design software

1081
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:06,889
about something very specific it's

1082
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,499
really challenging for them to make it

1083
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:12,259
as efficient as you can if you are both

1084
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:15,738
software and an operator the other

1085
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:17,150
aspect related to this is a lot of the

1086
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,159
companies that build software either

1087
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,588
publicly traded their venture capital

1088
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,778
funded and we've seen them decide

1089
00:41:21,588 --> 00:41:26,239
overnight hey we cannot provide services

1090
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:29,989
to the cannabis industry so until the

1091
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,219
federal legality changes you're at risk

1092
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,929
if you're running on someone else's

1093
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:34,400
platform that one day could say you know

1094
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,989
what we don't want to do this anymore

1095
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,119
you're done what do you tell your

1096
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:41,708
clients in that state so we believe that

1097
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,709
we should own our platform and build it

1098
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,420
in regard to the brand's the small

1099
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,739
farmer brands that have taken some

1100
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,630
investment upfront to build that brand

1101
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:55,869
do you for how do you force the

1102
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,030
appellation rights factoring into that

1103
00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:01,630
and whether or not it will become easier

1104
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:03,400
to support the branding for small

1105
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,289
farmers that the when it comes to

1106
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,760
distribution because it sounds like

1107
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,730
there's someone said a lot of traffic

1108
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:14,830
and that you know lots of players and

1109
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:16,539
hard to enter it's a small farmer so the

1110
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:20,279
question is what's the do you identify

1111
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:22,599
there to be value in the Appalachians or

1112
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,910
how do you see appellation rights

1113
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,489
factoring in and perhaps I mean I guess

1114
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:30,009
I have my own viewpoint easing the

1115
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:33,729
ability for an emerging brand or small

1116
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:35,290
farmer to be able to cut through some of

1117
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,420
the traffic and distinguish themselves

1118
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:39,579
because they have Appalachian of origin

1119
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,869
or some other protected category that I

1120
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:44,949
know people are working on that

1121
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:46,869
potentially could I would say how

1122
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:48,579
powerful is in Appalachian right is it

1123
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:50,949
if you have a small business but you get

1124
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:54,130
to call it Humboldt grown or but to see

1125
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:56,500
no gold is that gives you more sway in

1126
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,059
the marketplace yeah it's a huge I would

1127
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,619
put every effort that you could into

1128
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:01,750
creating Appalachians that's where you

1129
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:04,359
can create a recognizable and unique

1130
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,010
identifier to your brand I mean if you

1131
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,480
look at somebody who's creating

1132
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,910
something from Stag's Leap Vice

1133
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,210
Rutherford and those abilities to

1134
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:16,089
identify very high-end production

1135
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,829
regions it is easily something that

1136
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:21,160
creates differentiation and identifies a

1137
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:23,500
certain level of value not only for the

1138
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:25,149
manner in which you produce it all the

1139
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,030
way through to the connection that a

1140
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:31,000
consumer has to that particular region

1141
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:33,730
I think Appalachians is a very very

1142
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,139
valuable initiative that should be

1143
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,809
furthered and it will definitely change

1144
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:43,029
the scene of cannabis across California

1145
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:46,960
I was just gonna echo echo that and also

1146
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:49,710
say I think the Appalachians will be

1147
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,329
critical to for furthering the value of

1148
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,909
California and Emerald triangle and

1149
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,119
regional and specific cannabis as we do

1150
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:58,059
it

1151
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,690
and into a national and global market so

1152
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:04,029
it's critical Senator McGuire has a bill

1153
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:06,400
that just came out last week to kind of

1154
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:08,560
further clarify the point of origin for

1155
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,990
the appellations of origin which is

1156
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,029
great and there's a program called the

1157
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:15,219
Mendocino Appalachians project which is

1158
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:17,440
expanding its name I think to be the

1159
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:19,839
California Appalachians project so I

1160
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,369
would strongly recommend any anyone to

1161
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,800
get involved with that group support

1162
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,569
that group it's a small you know

1163
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,160
self-funded organization that takes

1164
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,830
donations and contributions but it's

1165
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:31,119
critical for small farmers and I don't

1166
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:32,769
know Mikey I thought you might want it

1167
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,529
to say something as well yeah for sure

1168
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:36,969
I'm actually very bullish on

1169
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,470
Appalachians I think it's certainly that

1170
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:40,179
the long game as lauren says I think

1171
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:43,539
it's gonna be more more valuable when we

1172
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:46,989
have the national market place to play

1173
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:49,239
in in fact one of the slides on my deck

1174
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:54,519
recently is if you look at the wine

1175
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:57,009
industry nationwide 4% of the volume of

1176
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:59,170
grapes come from Napa and Sonoma of the

1177
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:03,040
entire wine industry yet Napa and Sonoma

1178
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:04,990
wines command 54% of the revenue so

1179
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,639
while they produce a very large little

1180
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:07,719
amount of volume the revenue and the

1181
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,539
premium that they're getting is

1182
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:10,959
substantial and you know to Lauren's

1183
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:12,279
point

1184
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,289
I love the Mendocino Appalachians

1185
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,600
project there's an incredible groups in

1186
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:20,110
the Emerald triangle hcg a being one of

1187
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,849
them mcg a ICF a there's a couple of

1188
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:23,079
groups kind of trying to coalesce and

1189
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:24,460
find ways to collaborate and we're

1190
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:25,960
trying to figure out how to really put

1191
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,490
forward the appellations program and

1192
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,559
also do it in a way that the consumer

1193
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:32,189
can understand but the onus is on you to

1194
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:34,869
make that be something that the consumer

1195
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:37,150
understands so when they walk in they

1196
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:39,099
ask for it if they see it they recognize

1197
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,139
so band together with others and yours

1198
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:43,029
so if they come in they see a difference

1199
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,690
between that and something may be grown

1200
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:46,150
in a warehouse

1201
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,860
stinky warehouse in LA County and and

1202
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,630
let's not forget there are regions of

1203
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,280
the state that are globally known for

1204
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,010
being some of the best sources for

1205
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,660
cannabis in the world exactly I hate to

1206
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,040
cut it out this is a great great

1207
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:58,789
discussion let's hear once again for

1208
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,259
Laura Fraser all the panelists

1209
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,259
[Applause]
