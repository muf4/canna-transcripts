2003 started to work in the cannabis

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,959
industry started working the cannabis

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,199
industry in 2017 as germany legalized

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,759
medical cannabis by that time the first

75
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,679
cbd products came up and no one knew how

76
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,039
to regulate it and so it took a deep

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,879
dive into these uh legal landscape and

78
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,318
started to block and this block was read

79
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,719

germany thank you kai and daniel a few

86
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,679
words about yourself

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,080
i was a commodities trader before i

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,800
turned lawyer i was in business for

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
about 12 years in 2019

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,239
we decided to

91
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,518
establish the first dedicated cannabis

92
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,800
desk at the large law firm in

93
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,439
switzerland we represent a big part of

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,519
the big players in swiss industry

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,598
along the value chain

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,969
and basically that's it

97
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,598
three kids always tired

98
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:29,519
[Laughter]

99
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,280
thanks brother uh and kai why don't we

100
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,319
start with you as an update can you tell

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,318
us about uh from a regulatory standpoint

102
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,479
uh the status of things relating to hemp

103
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,079
and cbd as well as medical cannabis and

104
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,598
also maybe give us a glimpse as to

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,719
recreational reform here what that's

106
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,839
going to look like

107
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,479
okay how much time do i have yes

108
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,878
where can we start

109
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,719
so yeah okay let's talk about about

110
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,239
legalization i guess

111
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,799
so

112
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,438
the german government decided last year

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,120
in november to legalize cannabis and

114
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,120
they set up a coalition agreement

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,680
stating just one sentence

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,799
so we will allow the distribution of for

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,200
of cannabis for adults in licensed shops

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,040
just one sentence okay

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,120
so and now we're in the middle of the

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,400
debate how to do that we are talking

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,000
about maximum numbers of licensed stores

122
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,638
of caps

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,839
we have an actual debate of

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,879
thc content in the flower to use or to

125
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,239
limit the thc content in the in in the

126
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,159
dried flowers

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,040
we are also talking about

128
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,240
if we shall allow finished products like

129
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,160
waves and edibles and beverages

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,960
and it's still in in in in a flux so

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
we expecting the first draft in october

132
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,638
november

133
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,600
it's presented by the ministry of health

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
because we think or the politician the

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
policy

136
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,638
things the this is in health issue so

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
you really have to understand that it's

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,519
it's all about health it's about harm

139
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,120
reduction

140
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,439
and if you want to do business here you

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,918
have to keep that in mind so

142
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,000
all the debates around this health issue

143
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,079
because we have really bad

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
stuff in the illicit market right now it

145
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,199
got better it got worse and worse over

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,038
the years

147
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
so the need for reform is very very

148
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,800
strong here in germany right now

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,280
but that's the point so if

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
we have the drug addiction societies for

151
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,478
example they're making a lot of pressure

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,079
on the ministry of health

153
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,918
they want these

154
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,599
reduced opening hours they want to

155
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,918
reduce thc content they want

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
no advertisement no

157
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,758
no

158
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,720
logo no brands on the finished products

159
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,400
and

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,720
we as the industry are just fighting all

161
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,679
these points right now to have a liberal

162
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,880
market model to have so that the

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,439
industry is incentivized to invest and

164
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,959
to establish a business and to take the

165
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,478
fight against the illicit market right

166
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,318
now so that's

167
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,478
some for the beginning

168
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,000
thank you very helpful uh and daniel we

169
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,839
hear that the medical cannabis market in

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,439
switzerland is opening up we're very

171
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,119
excited about that what are some of the

172
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,160
specific changes we can expect and what

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,160
challenges still remain

174
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
that's a big subject a lot of questions

175
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,120
uh we have in switzerland we've had a

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,120
medical system where you required a

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,959
special permit from the federal office

178
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
of public health to be able to get

179
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,519
access to medical cannabis for a long

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,360
time

181
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,959
and that has made life for a lot of

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,360
patients difficult

183
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,519
around a hundred thousand patients in

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
switzerland today are known or estimated

185
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,560
by the federal office of public health

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,479
to consume cannabis for medical purposes

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,639
out of maybe four or five hundred

188
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,519
there's a dark number obviously of

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,000
cannabis consumers in total

190
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,758
and the tragedy was that out of these

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
hundred thousand patients only three

192
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,400
four thousand actually had access to

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,079
legal medical cannabis so

194
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,638
96 97 000 patients actually had to

195
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,120
resort to the illicit market

196
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,319
and procure cannabis from

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,759
sources they knew or didn't know and as

198
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,919
we know and as

199
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,160
my colleague kai here mentioned the

200
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,758
quality is not controlled in the illicit

201
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
market and we have a big issue with

202
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
cannabis that's

203
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,519
spiced up with all kinds of some

204
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
synthetic materials that nobody knows

205
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,639
exactly what it is so it's quite a

206
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,319
tragedy for the patients associations

207
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,560
now what happened is that this special

208
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,800
nature of the permit

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
became to some extent mute because such

210
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,038
a an overwhelming demand

211
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,560
emerged in the market

212
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,560
and what happened now is that the

213
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,038
government realized it and now

214
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,038
after many years the change is going to

215
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,680
be enacted in the beginning of on the

216
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,598
1st of august in fact where two things

217
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,199
are essentially changing cannabis is

218
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,159
moving from

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,759
the schedule of prohibited narcotics

220
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
into

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,560
narcotics that can be used for medical

222
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,720
purposes without this special permit so

223
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,879
every doctor in switzerland will

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,080
essentially be able to prescribe medical

225
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,360
cannabis which is a very big opening and

226
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,199
then the second thing that's going to

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,879
happen is that the export market is

228
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,960
going to open up and that's interesting

229
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
for investors to realize because swiss

230
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,318
producers

231
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,638
a lot of whom have been very active in

232
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
the cbd market in the last few years

233
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,079
they're going to have a possibility now

234
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,680
to legally export

235
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,918
medical cannabis in all forms

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,918
so that's these are the two main

237
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,519
uh changes that are going to happen

238
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,360
specifically now you have you've asked

239
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,240
me as well about the challenges

240
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,839
of the challenges are many i would say

241
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,320
one of the main challenge starts with

242
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
education because most doctors don't

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
really understand

244
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,199
cannabis or didn't have the experience

245
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,240
to prescribe cannabis most of

246
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,278
whom have not heard about the

247
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,600
endocannabinoid system

248
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,799
they don't know which cannabinoids and

249
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,320
which

250
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,838
mixes of cannabinoids prescriptions

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
match which

252
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
indication and for which indications you

253
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,278
can prescribe medical cannabis so that's

254
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,039
a huge

255
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,439
field that's opening up and for

256
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,919
investors i would keep my eyes very

257
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,560
open on opportunities in education

258
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,240
so that's one field that's uh that's

259
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,719
very challenging the other field i would

260
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,200
say is of administrative nature

261
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,278
there is a problem with um

262
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
filling in magisterial preparations

263
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,559
there is only one way to prescribe

264
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,719
medical cannabis in switzerland similar

265
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,879
to germany i think you don't have

266
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
finished products

267
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,600
fully licensed drugs

268
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,919
the path to go there is very wide except

269
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,360
for maybe

270
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,278
sativex and and epidiolex which are a

271
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
very narrow band of indications of

272
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,320
course you can

273
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,519
have off-label prescription but in

274
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,278
general

275
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
it's all through magisterial

276
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,000
extemporaneous preparations

277
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,039
and it's not easy to prescribe based on

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,278
extemporaneous preparations because you

279
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,120
have to grow with the patient which is

280
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,799
also one of the beauties in this product

281
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,039
that you can really try

282
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,439
it's trial and error but a lot of

283
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,919
doctors will be very reluctant to just

284
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,600
go for trial and error so there's the

285
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,199
swiss society of cannabis in medicine

286
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
and other organizations that are working

287
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
very hard

288
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,839
to establish some standards with which

289
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
you can actually

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
start to to prescribe

291
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,039
and i would say the

292
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,639
third

293
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,719
challenge is that there's no

294
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,639
reimbursement from the health insurance

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,560
and i think that's one of the main

296
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,199
issues that we have is that efficacy is

297
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,239
very difficult to prove

298
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
and

299
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,440
as long as we don't have

300
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,399
reimbursement the question remains

301
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,079
whether this uh this market's really

302
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,120
going to open up for a lot of patients

303
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,278
who

304
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,519
will be struggling to finance

305
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,039
the high costs of cannabis medication i

306
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,399
think of

307
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,039
very helpful daniel thank you and a

308
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,799
great great overview uh peter uh what

309
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,078
regulatory challenges do you see with

310
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,919
planned recreational cannabis

311
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,399
legalization in germany which has all of

312
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,240
us in america very excited yeah indeed a

313
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,440
very very interesting question let's

314
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,560
take a top-down view at first

315
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,440
germany as well as another over 180

316
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,958
countries a member of the un

317
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,480
convention

318
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,479
1961

319
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
and two other conventions

320
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,720
regarding the

321
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,839
transit the transfer of

322
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,920
drugs

323
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,760
and cannabis is still considered one of

324
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,439
those drugs which fall under the

325
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,559
respective convention

326
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,480
number two germany is also a eu member

327
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,359
state and has signed off on the schengen

328
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,639
agreement which also refers to

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,639
the respective u.n conventions which

330
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,639
means that

331
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,560
the export of cannabis let's say flowers

332
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,560
or other products for recreational

333
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,638
purposes from one country to the other

334
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,039
country is strictly prohibited by these

335
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,000
conventions in the schengen agreement

336
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,000
so when the coalition actually

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,720
wrote this one wonderful sentence into

338
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,559
the coalition agreement they did not

339
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,879
think about it and that's in my personal

340
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,119
opinion where can we source the collapse

341
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,200
for the recreational for the adult use

342
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,959
market in germany

343
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
and that's the first issue which we have

344
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,958
to solve it's it's really an issue

345
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
it is now being discussed are there

346
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,958
solutions to it well there are solutions

347
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,040
to it to a certain extent at least as we

348
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,679
have seen in uruguay canada and the

349
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,719
netherlands where recreational use is of

350
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,638
course

351
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
happening so

352
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,680
domestic cultivation

353
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,078
for example or home grow for example are

354
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,359
our solutions to that and i may address

355
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,000
that at a later stage a little bit more

356
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,560
in detail then the next step is we have

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,240
to create a respective legal environment

358
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,359
we need a law we need a control

359
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,720
body

360
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,639
with regards to the distribution of the

361
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
recreational cannabis in germany will it

362
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,919
be through pharmacies would it be

363
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
through licensed shops as it is

364
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,559
mentioned in the agreement or how do we

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,200
do that infrastructure

366
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,559
what is the legal basis for it who

367
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
controls it

368
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,518
so

369
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,680
lots of other challenges are of course

370
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,278
coming from the quality

371
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,599
and we heard about that the current

372
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:27,919
illicit market has

373
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,278
cannabis products on or sold which have

374
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,919
additions

375
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,879
which have supplements which are

376
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:38,399
definitely unhealthy so the illicit

377
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,879
market is using drugs which do not of

378
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
course have the same quality as as we

379
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,519
would like to have it on the market but

380
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,839
the quality control of a recreational

381
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,078
cannabis product which is then sold

382
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,320
under the government control that needs

383
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,719
a legal basis so we have a number of

384
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
challenges which have to be addressed

385
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
very good thank you peter that's very

386
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,919
helpful overview kai let's take it back

387
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
to you what are some of the distribution

388
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,198
rules for medical cannabis and what is

389
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,199
the process when trading these products

390
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,319
medical cannabis is

391
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,278
only traded via the pharmacies

392
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
okay

393
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,360
so the first step for you as a patient

394
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
is you go to the doctor

395
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,199
you have a condition

396
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,079
the doctor has to be convinced that this

397
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,359
condition is uh suitable for cannabis

398
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,638
prescription

399
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,240
and the decision of the prescription is

400
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,399
in the uh sole discretion of the of the

401
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
physician of the doctor

402
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,759
so

403
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,680
there isn't it's not limited like in

404
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,278
portugal where you have seven

405
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,838
designations or applications

406
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:49,360
and uh yeah with this prescription you

407
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,240
go to the pharmacy and uh get your

408
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,360
medical cannabis so what was uh as we

409
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,919
started in 17 the

410
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,440
price per gram medical cannabis was

411
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,958
22-23

412
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,920
euros per gram

413
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,039
that's a lot so what we saw now the last

414
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,679
two years

415
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,399
a couple of pharmacies

416
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,599
really invested in logistics got really

417
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,000
really big sometimes

418
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,440
employing more than 100

419
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,759
pharmacists

420
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,639
and the prices dropped to

421
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,120
9 10 11 euros per gram so almost

422
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,278
comparable to the illicit market

423
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,320
and on the other hand we saw business

424
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,639
models

425
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
like taylor medicine so

426
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,919
you

427
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,920
go to the physician and they have sort

428
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,399
of clinics all over all over the place

429
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,879
all over germany and you have to show up

430
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,799
the first time in person and get your

431
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,879
prescription and then your following

432
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,359
prescription you can get you can obtain

433
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,639
we are online via internet

434
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,720
so we see a huge number of patients

435
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
of private patients of self-paying

436
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
patients

437
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,838
they are not

438
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,239
applying for reimbursement um

439
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,399
they just take it okay it's like

440
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,959
it's like 10 11 euros i would pay that

441
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,879
in the in the illicit market but now i'm

442
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,078
a patient and i have control over the

443
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:12,720
quality of control over of the product

444
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,719
and i don't take the hustle with my

445
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,360
public or private

446
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,320
health insurer to to get reimbursed so

447
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,399
that's the latest development we saw in

448
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,040
medical cannabis the big question will

449
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,839
be will all these people who are now

450
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,639
in the medical cannabis market will they

451
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,720
withdraw and switch to the

452
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,198
legal market or

453
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,680
does the medical cannabis market

454
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,278
even increases further

455
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,599
very good thank you kai

456
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,958
daniel what's the status of cbd products

457
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,199
in switzerland are they marketed as

458
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,439
tobacco substitutes fragrant oils

459
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,838
cosmetics novel foods therapeutic

460
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
products meaning

461
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,920
drugs i'm going to try to keep this one

462
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,079
a bit shorter than the last answer

463
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,319
all of those products

464
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,799
in fact tobacco substitutes i would say

465
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,240
counts for one of the biggest markets in

466
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,318
switzerland

467
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,798
which is just dried flour perfectly

468
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,720
legal to be sold as long as the thc

469
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,558
content is below one percent which is a

470
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,798
bit of an exception in europe

471
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,639
i think czech republic just uh

472
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,558
introduced the one percent thc limit as

473
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,839
well by the beginning of this year

474
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,639
then we have

475
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,198
cannabis oils there is a big issue about

476
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,839
cannabis oils that have been marketed to

477
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,679
some extent is chemical products

478
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,200
the federal office of public health

479
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,038
realized that

480
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,080
these oils that have been sold as

481
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,038
scented oils could be abused for

482
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,119
um

483
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,519
for other purposes

484
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,839
and came to the conclusion and

485
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:47,119
issued an ordinance that

486
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,000
basically said that you have to

487
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,959
denaturalize this product

488
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,558
and now

489
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,640
you basically can't

490
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,119
consume these products without the

491
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,679
extremely bitter taste so that market's

492
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,678
not really existing or it's at least

493
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,320
expected to be disappearing

494
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,919
then there's uh cosmetic products which

495
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:11,279
are a perfectly legitimate way to uh

496
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,240
to bring cbd products to market today we

497
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,319
think it's one of the only ways

498
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,319
that in the in the

499
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:23,200
non-medical use field you can actually

500
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,480
apply these products so cosmetics is an

501
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,440
absolutely valid way to bring cannabis

502
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,000
oils and other products to market uh as

503
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
uh on for topical and even

504
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,359
um

505
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,880
use in like mouth sprays and so on so

506
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,159
that's also something that's uh that's

507
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,160
possible

508
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,840
then we have the medical applications

509
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,840
which obviously have to run through

510
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,919
a different kind of route but that's

511
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,320
absolutely also legitimate way to market

512
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,759
and already we see cbd oils that are and

513
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,839
tinctures that are prescribed for

514
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,960
medical purposes as well

515
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,519
very good

516
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,519
peter let's talk about the illegal

517
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,200
market how do you assess the impact of

518
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,679
recreational cannabis legalization on

519
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,600
the illegal market in germany and

520
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,880
if you care to uh throughout other parts

521
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,199
of europe

522
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,960
yeah well that is one of those crystal

523
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,679
ball questions

524
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,440
and i try to read my crystal ball right

525
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
now because we don't know how the market

526
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,640
will develop and when we have

527
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,679
recreational cannabis on the market here

528
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,520
in germany

529
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,840
uh from my point of view definitely not

530
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,960
before

531
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,558
2024 but

532
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,120
if you look into the developments for

533
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:31,119
example in canada how the impact was on

534
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,918
the black market i think we have three

535
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,159
factors which are extremely important

536
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,038
number one price

537
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,960
number two accessibility availability of

538
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,160
the product and number three it's

539
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
quality

540
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,160
these are the three major factors who

541
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,279
have an impact on the respective uh

542
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,600
legal

543
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,839
cannabis market for adult use if we have

544
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,558
the right price if we have the right

545
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,839
availability and if you have the right

546
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,519
quality

547
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:03,678
i'm sure that we definitely could cut

548
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,359
the the black market

549
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,000
by half

550
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,240
but let's talk about how big is the

551
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,759
black market actually in germany

552
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,319
we are talking about a medicinal

553
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:18,319
cannabis market around now

554
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,720
between 18 to 20 metric tons per year

555
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,359
with an increasing quantity

556
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,480
the black market is

557
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,759
judged

558
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,120
by at approximately 700 metric tons in

559
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,519
germany

560
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,119
that is a significant market

561
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:38,720
and now the current calculations uh even

562
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,839
for a how do we tax

563
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,440
cannabis for the recreational market uh

564
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:48,480
is uh cutting it by well it's uh

565
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,360
estimating 400 metric tons which is

566
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:55,279
around half of the black market

567
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:58,479
so very very important as i said price

568
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,918
accessibility availability and quality

569
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,400
if that is

570
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,640
competing with the illicit market we

571
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,759
definitely are in a position to cut it

572
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
short by 50 or even more very much

573
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,519
depending on

574
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,439
how this will be done the current

575
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,079
discussion about

576
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,200
implementing a certain

577
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,439
cap on the thc level

578
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,759
is definitely from my point of view

579
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,600
helpful for for this

580
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,599
discussion because it's going to

581
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,519
divide the illicit market

582
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,720
and the legal market by the factor of

583
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,480
whatever percentages may be maybe 15 16

584
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,558
18

585
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,919
we know that currently the medical

586
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:46,960
market demand for cannabis products with

587
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,840
high thc content around 20 percent and

588
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,840
above is definitely the market at this

589
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,798
point in time it may change it may

590
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,199
change to

591
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,359
extracts but that's what we have now in

592
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,759
germany it's the majority is a flower

593
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,479
market with high content ghc flowers

594
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,400
with

595
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,279
a constant quality

596
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,720
so

597
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,720
we can transfer that to the through the

598
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,200
legal market as well

599
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,360
but i don't think that a limit of

600
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,200
whatever the limit may be

601
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,719
would be helpful for the legal adult u.s

602
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
market

603
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,720
very good and peter orkai

604
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,200
i have a follow-up question relating to

605
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,798
taxes so in the united states

606
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,120
particularly when we went from medical

607
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,079
markets to recreational markets

608
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,558
we

609
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,918
couldn't resist the temptation to tax

610
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,678
very heavily

611
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,799
just saying wow here's an opportunity to

612
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,080
bring in some extra money to the

613
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,079
government and there's a notion that

614
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,759
this tax money will go to educate folks

615
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,158
on the dangers of cannabis and so on and

616
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,960
so forth that never really works out

617
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,640
and the end result on the illegal market

618
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
conversation is that the illegal market

619
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,880
thrives because the pricing of legal

620
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,880
product goes through the roof and so in

621
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,039
the united states we obviously have been

622
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,679
further along in terms of years

623
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:02,079
but there is a great big mess because

624
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,559
the illegal market continues to to

625
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,240
govern over half of the revenues of of

626
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,319
the market just in california which is a

627
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,480
very advanced market so my question to

628
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,240
you is do you have any notion as to how

629
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,079
germany is going to

630
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,279
approach taxation of the recreational

631
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,558
cannabis market

632
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,839
yeah sure so the government is aware of

633
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,480
that problem

634
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,038
of that tax and price problem there's

635
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,038
one draft on the table by the green

636
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,480
party the cannabis control act that

637
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:33,599
drafted this law already back in 2015.

638
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,640
it was in bundestag in 2017

639
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,678
rejected of course it was

640
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,520
in bundestag in 2021

641
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,798
rejected of course by the last grand

642
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,200
coalition

643
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:51,359
and they propose four euros per

644
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,919
gram of dried flour and six euros per

645
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,319
other products for extracts

646
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,640
that's too much so

647
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,439
then you will end up at 12

648
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,440
12 to 14 euros per gram

649
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,558
but there was

650
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,840
an economist a very famous economist for

651
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,079
regulated markets here in germany

652
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:14,079
professor houckup and he did a study and

653
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:16,558
he suggests a 2.6 euro per gram

654
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,399
so that you end up with 10 euros

655
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,918
including vit of 19

656
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,798
and that's the price which can compete

657
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,960
on the

658
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,798
with the illicit market and some

659
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,319
consumers of course are prepared to pay

660
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,798
a little more because you have a

661
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,678
controlled quality

662
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,759
and

663
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,360
probably of course there will be

664
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,919
room for for

665
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,199
even higher prices for craft cannabis or

666
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
something

667
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,798
not the 50

668
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,880
euro per gram i saw in barcelona i guess

669
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,038
but

670
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,120
for one gram per one gram but the

671
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,720
government the lawmakers are quite aware

672
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,639
of that so

673
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,000
i'm pretty convinced i'm pretty sure

674
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,720
that there will be a fair price at the

675
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,798
end

676
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,720
very good that's wonderful to hear and i

677
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,400
hope you're correct peter yeah maybe

678
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,319
maybe some some

679
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,840
additions to that the point is of course

680
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,240
who which cultivator is in a position

681
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,558
to provide this

682
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,400
high quality cannabis at that point at

683
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:13,759
that price

684
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,798
of course you can

685
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,038
have a relatively uh cheap price for

686
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,079
specific cannabis not but not if it's a

687
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,759
gmp

688
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,599
uh controlled uh if it's good

689
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,240
manufacturing practice following which

690
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,839
is

691
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,599
from my point of view the minimum

692
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,199
quality which we which we have to look

693
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,639
at and i don't think the government is

694
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
going to change that we have to find

695
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
cultivators who are in a position to do

696
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,919
that

697
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:39,038
probably not in canada probably not in

698
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,278
colombia maybe yes maybe portugal yeah

699
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,599
malta for example we can talk about that

700
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,599
macedonia north macedonia for example

701
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,000
greece i have cultivators coming up

702
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,000
there as well as denmark oops take into

703
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,240
consideration the current energy prices

704
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,798
i have my doubts so that that's number

705
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,798
one which we have to look at who is in

706
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,119
the position who which cultivators on a

707
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,918
position to provide than the respect of

708
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,639
kind of it it would be exported anyway

709
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,559
but i'm coming back to uh the first

710
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,400
problem which i mentioned is the 1961

711
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,200
single convention which means

712
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,278
uh

713
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,200
how can we import

714
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,880
can we import at all any kind of

715
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,798
cannabis for the recreational market yes

716
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,520
or no so we are maybe looking at

717
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,119
domestic growth and how this is going to

718
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,720
be achieved the next question we have

719
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,439
three cultivators in germany who are

720
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,880
doing uh relatively low quantities for

721
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,798
the medicinal market uh afria aurora and

722
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,480
demi khan as we all know

723
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,558
and they have put the first first

724
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,798
cannabis cultivated germany on the

725
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,319
medicinal market so they would be in a

726
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,200
position to increase as they have

727
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,439
announced already uh the production uh

728
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,360
domestically but well others should

729
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,200
participate as well so do we have a

730
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,719
tender process probably not do we have a

731
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,480
licensing process as we heard this

732
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,440
morning probably yes

733
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,599
so that is from my point of view the way

734
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,640
going forward and

735
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,719
finding

736
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,400
licensed producers in germany as we have

737
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,798
it in uruguay as we have it in the

738
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,080
netherlands they just tended by the way

739
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,038
our

740
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,399
domestic uh cultivation for the

741
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,158
recreational market in in the

742
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,759
netherlands

743
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,600
is that the right way we will see that

744
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,240
we'll probably hear that tomorrow at the

745
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,959
icbc conference from mr wienert

746
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,759
what kind of ideas he may have on that

747
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,759
and

748
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,000
we'll see the next issue we have of

749
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,640
course a lot of calculations on what is

750
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,960
uh the the positive impact of the

751
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,038
recreational market uh and take into

752
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,960
consideration that we really would cover

753
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,200
400 metric tons

754
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,240
the actual advantage take into

755
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,600
consideration a tax on the product like

756
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,599
tobacco

757
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,359
then of course the vat

758
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,278
and all the other taxes which are

759
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,959
surrounding the whole industry

760
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,159
we are talking about an advantage of

761
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,240
around 4 billion euros per year

762
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,480
for the for the for the government a

763
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,000
rough calculation of course not very

764
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,798
founded because we don't know how it

765
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,798
will work out but that's that's an incr

766
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,278
significant figure which is of course

767
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,918
also driving that process here

768
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,679
and you know four billion income for for

769
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,840
the government is definitely something

770
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,679
which is worthwhile to consider and of

771
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,439
course it is tempting

772
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,679
always tempting as we have seen that on

773
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,919
the tobacco products and of on alcohol

774
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,278
to just squeeze a little bit more of the

775
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,120
tax into

776
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,599
from from the respective product just

777
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,918
that percent here that percent there

778
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,839
and then of course we are exactly at the

779
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,559
problem which which kai friday just

780
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,558
mentioned we have a non-competitive

781
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,879
product on the market for the recreation

782
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,119
of our use and that's something which we

783
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,840
have to look at

784
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,479
what is also discussed is to have a

785
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:46,158
mixed taxation model

786
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,839
so to take more taxes on high thc

787
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,240
content products

788
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,759
and low thc content products uh taxed

789
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,519
differently then

790
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,480
this is uh because

791
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,839
again this is a health issue uh

792
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,440
people think that high thc content is

793
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,599
more dangerous more um

794
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,240
to to be controlled more to be

795
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:11,199
there needs to be some prevention of of

796
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,399
using high thc content products and they

797
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,720
want to do that

798
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,398
with taxation that's also a

799
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,079
proposition on the table

800
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,119
but i think you can't handle that in the

801
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,918
beginning so then in the end it will

802
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,719
come up that high thc products are too

803
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,278
expensive and is still

804
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,079
traded on the on the illicit market

805
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,599
and we don't want that we want a

806
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,398
complete fight

807
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,199
against the illicit market

808
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,798
and

809
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
you really can't

810
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,200
estimate the tax

811
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,079
in the tax revenue if you have if you

812
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,519
split that up in in thc content

813
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,119
but we will see so

814
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,519
it's on the table it's discussed right

815
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,278
now because of the high thc content the

816
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,879
health issue let's see

817
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,278
very good thank you both gentlemen that

818
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,799
was very helpful very informative daniel

819
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,159
germany is out a bit

820
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,079
in front obviously as respect

821
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,240
switzerland on the recreational cannabis

822
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,519
conversation what is the status of

823
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,038
recreational cannabis in switzerland

824
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,038
in switzerland

825
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,240
the both the national and the state

826
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:16,640
council last year approved a change

827
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,240
following a parliamentary initiative

828
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,038
to regulate

829
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,079
cannabis and create the legal market

830
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,558
so we're also moving right ahead it's

831
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,240
just taking a bit more time

832
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,038
the health commission of the national

833
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,798
council is now in a process of preparing

834
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,200
draft legislation

835
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,200
for the purpose of debate with the

836
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,798
federal council which is us our

837
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,159
executive power

838
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,359
and um so the conversation is ongoing

839
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,440
what's also

840
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,278
happening in parallel is that the

841
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,960
federal of office of public health

842
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,440
there's been a change in the narcotics

843
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,798
act that allows for pilot trials

844
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,880
so as of uh autumn this year the pilot

845
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,960
trials will actually start to kick off

846
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,240
it's all in the context of purely

847
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,519
scientific

848
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
context

849
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,919
um as peter mentioned uh the factors

850
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,798
that will be

851
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,038
checked will be price availability

852
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,038
and

853
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,519
quality of course but also other

854
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,200
socioeconomic

855
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,919
concepts

856
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,080
the effect on the on the black market

857
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,240
health will be measured data will be

858
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,759
collected and so on um

859
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,159
that will start

860
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,798
uh i'm a bit skeptical about the trials

861
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,399
that they will be able to produce enough

862
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,278
statistical relevant

863
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,678
statistical data before the legislation

864
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,200
actually has to move on because i think

865
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,960
we're in where in

866
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,080
a time where if germany starts to

867
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,038
legalize

868
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,359
and has legalized

869
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,759
cannabis switzerland will have to make a

870
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,000
move much quicker so it's actually good

871
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,398
that our neighbor is now moving fully

872
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,880
ahead and all the tough subjects are

873
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,239
being discussed and what i can imagine

874
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,480
is that once there is a draft

875
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,640
legislation in germany that the swiss

876
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
will simply more or less look at that

877
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
and copy paste and make give a swiss

878
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,720
spin to it and

879
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,480
move ahead a bit faster

880
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,240
very exciting well i'm hoping that that

881
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,240
happens

882
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,880
kai let's come back to you what are the

883
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,240
administrative uh court of cologne and

884
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,919
the eu commission on novel food

885
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,558
applications doing that can ultimately

886
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,559
affect the cbd market uh in europe as a

887
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,158
whole

888
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,798
oh yeah

889
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,360
so there was a ruling of the

890
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,359
administrative accord of cologne in

891
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,639
march this year

892
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,519
saying that

893
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,399
cbd is in general a medicine and as a

894
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,759
medicine you need an authorization

895
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,678
by the bee farm like a regular medicine

896
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,079
with the clinical studies phase one two

897
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,559
three uh double blind placebo et cetera

898
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,960
so this uh this process takes ten years

899
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,158
cost you 10 to 15 million euros at the

900
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,798
best

901
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,278
and the cologne ruling said okay

902
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,278
even if you under-dose it it was a

903
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,240
product with a recommendation for 18

904
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:06,880
milligram of cbd intake per day and even

905
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,319
this under-dosed

906
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,399
dosage

907
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:14,398
makes the or shall make the product

908
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:16,158
to a regular medicine um and um

909
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,639
that was like oh everyone whoa what's

910
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,559
going on here we

911
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,880
we are applying for noble food

912
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,359
authorization we the ihear is spending

913
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,480
uh three to four million for these noble

914
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:31,199
food authorizations

915
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,120
for toxicological studies with

916
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,960
with rodents in the first place and then

917
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,639
human

918
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,399
exposure in in the end and we

919
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,120
expecting that the first results are

920
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:46,479
coming in the at the end of next year

921
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,639
so that you can market cbd as a food

922
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,319
again as a supplement again that's not

923
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,399
possible right now

924
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,278
but if this cologne ruling would be

925
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,839
right

926
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:59,038
germany would opt out of

927
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,720
of the complete cbd market in europe so

928
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,679
so we took a deep

929
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,919
analysis of this of this ruling um and

930
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,159
the administrative court of cologne has

931
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,800
a special role in

932
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,240
in its history they are the last

933
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,720
fighters for

934
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,439
finished medicines so to say

935
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,279
and

936
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,159
but this ruling is against the the ecg

937
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,359
rulings which have been issued the last

938
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,320
20 years

939
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:28,398
so in my opinion it's uh it's it's it's

940
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,639
wrong it's a wrong ruling

941
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,638
and it's only in the first instance so i

942
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,599
can't imagine that this

943
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,919
will be that this will survive

944
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,919
the the next instances

945
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,878
and at in the end at least

946
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:45,279
the european law will step in the free

947
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,319
movement of goods principle

948
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,399
will

949
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,280
also apply for these products in germany

950
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:50,638
so

951
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
you have to handle it you have to look

952
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,800
at it and have to be very careful

953
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,358
especially when you

954
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,680
make health claims or any other claims

955
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,679
to your cbd product you should be very

956
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,469
very reluctant and don't do that and

957
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,039
don't

958
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:07,919
[Music]

959
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,599
alarm the regulator

960
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,559
because they don't like that if you if

961
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,359
you promise too much for these cbd

962
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,480
products which everyone in the zebra in

963
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:21,519
the cb in the cbd business did uh you

964
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,039
know it cures cancer it's good for

965
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,639
anxiety for sleep disorders etc and you

966
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,358
can prove it okay

967
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:33,199
so uh just don't do it and then we won't

968
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,159
have rulings like the one in in cologne

969
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,838
very good

970
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,679
uh peter

971
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,199
how do you how soon do you think when do

972
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,960
you think recreational cannabis will be

973
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,039
legalized in germany and in other

974
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,079
european countries and

975
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:49,199
on what factors does that depend

976
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,000
yeah a very good question tom

977
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,879
um

978
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,800
as the ma as the legalization of

979
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,200
medicinal cannabis in germany wasn't

980
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,920
really a masterpiece

981
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,759
now they want to do it right

982
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,240
why wasn't it a masterpiece too many

983
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,720
gray areas too many

984
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,719
issues have not been regulated

985
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,639
and came into

986
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,118
practice and

987
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,598
even still discussed uh for example with

988
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,079
regard to the import of flowers which

989
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,960
are just gacp processed

990
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,680
and then gmp processed here in germany

991
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,720
is that a possibility yes or no

992
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:29,039
so a lot of issues uh haven't been

993
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,919
addressed at that point in time when

994
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,358
liberalization in 2017 in march 2017

995
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,400
took place

996
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,639
now they do want to do it better which

997
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,280
is which is a good idea we had

998
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,559
five or six now five hearings uh during

999
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,880
the march of

1000
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,880
uh june sorry during the month of june

1001
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,440
with respect to various issues expert

1002
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,880
hearings regarding various issues uh for

1003
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,320
the legalization of adult use

1004
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,160
we will probably hear a little bit more

1005
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,119
about that because only the last one was

1006
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,440
public uh by tomorrow uh what the

1007
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,358
outcome will be and how it looks like uh

1008
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,440
the current plan of the government is

1009
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:09,838
that to have the first draft of uh a law

1010
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,920
let's say let's call it cannabis law uh

1011
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,440
because it just has more facets let's

1012
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,800
call it cannabis law we'll be on the

1013
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,320
table by

1014
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,000
october november i won't uh

1015
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,680
i believe it we won't see it before

1016
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,320
december this year

1017
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:27,919
then of course it has to be uh

1018
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,160
accepted by the the the parliament uh we

1019
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,838
have to have one reading maybe a second

1020
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,920
reading in the bulldozer

1021
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:35,920
which is our second chamber

1022
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,760
which currently doesn't have a majority

1023
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,760
of the uh

1024
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,359
government so we would see how the

1025
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,520
reaction will be

1026
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,078
whether the bundesar the second chain

1027
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:48,559
was going to approve that law and when

1028
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,680
that will be the case so i probably

1029
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,039
foresee

1030
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,358
in germany the uh respective law to

1031
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,519
liberalize adult use in germany not

1032
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,440
before the end of

1033
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,800
first probably in the second quarter of

1034
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,720
2024 maybe even later this is 2023 maybe

1035
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,200
even later and then the whole process

1036
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,759
started with regard to where do we get

1037
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,960
the cannabis actually from uh are the

1038
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,800
current cultivators in germany

1039
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,760
on the move already can they increase

1040
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,200
the capacity for the first demand of the

1041
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,440
recreational

1042
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:24,480
use which is one of the

1043
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,920
solutions uh which may maybe take into

1044
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,679
consideration uh and i probably foresee

1045
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,079
not before to mid of 2024 the first

1046
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,039
recreational cannabis on the market well

1047
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,320
of course it's a look into a glass

1048
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,559
crystal ball

1049
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,200
but take into consideration how long it

1050
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:46,239
usually takes to have not only the laws

1051
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,399
in place but also then the respective

1052
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,799
infrastructure in place with regard to

1053
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,599
cultivation and distribution uh and i

1054
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,200
said accessibility uh availability of

1055
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,160
the product is is a major issue

1056
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,598
i think the timeline is probably right

1057
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,279
okay

1058
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,800
yeah so that's

1059
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,760
perfectly right so if the draft comes up

1060
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,839
in in bundestag the first time which may

1061
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,520
be november december then usually four

1062
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,759
to six months later

1063
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,599
the parliament will agree on that

1064
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,599
and peter is completely right but i

1065
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,320
think there are solutions either to the

1066
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,240
u.n the signal convention problem

1067
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,838
and as well as to the eu level we

1068
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,159
learned the last couple of days that the

1069
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,078
german government started negotiations

1070
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,559
started talking to the european

1071
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,240
neighbors to malta to luxembourg

1072
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,320
to portugal

1073
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,358
they are meeting already trying to set

1074
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,880
up a new framework a new legal landscape

1075
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,920
for cannabis in europe which is

1076
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,000
necessary there are lots of diplomacy

1077
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,559
diplomatic efforts are necessary now to

1078
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,358
establish new trade relations to

1079
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,358
amman to alter all these international

1080
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,039
obligations germany has and they started

1081
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,880
this process so i'm confident that there

1082
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:01,358
will be a solution in the end

1083
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,358
what probably will happen first is that

1084
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,000
cannabis social clubs so

1085
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,318
homegrown and

1086
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,039
corporate home grow will be allowed as

1087
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,519
the first measure so if the law is

1088
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,199
agreed on in march next year probably

1089
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,039
from that day on cannabis will be

1090
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:20,318
decriminalized and you have the right

1091
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,239
for homegrown and to grow together in a

1092
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,880
cannabis social club

1093
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:28,318
and this will be probably a long longer

1094
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,440
time so 10 12 months still the legal

1095
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,960
commercial sales maybe really can start

1096
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,119
and in this meantime

1097
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,679
which is good because then the pressure

1098
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,800
of the supply for the german population

1099
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,598
is

1100
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,280
as

1101
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,920
east

1102
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,519
but probably we will see then maybe uh

1103
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,200
cannabis social clubs with thousand

1104
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,159
members or three thousand members in

1105
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,239
berlin

1106
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,118
and of course then you delegate the

1107
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,039
right for planting the

1108
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,599
the proposition on the table is three

1109
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,239
throwing plants for every person

1110
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,838
so you can delegate your right to grow

1111
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:07,279
three plants to a community

1112
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,880
and then you have huge uh growth

1113
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,400
if you have thousand members so we have

1114
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,599
three thousand plants and you need a

1115
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,838
facility uh you need the all the um

1116
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,359
the equipment and you need the corporate

1117
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,960
structure and the government or the the

1118
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,119
regulators have to control it have to

1119
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,159
check it regularly so let's see what

1120
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,760
happened

1121
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,118
um i have one follow-up question here

1122
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,640
and then i do want to leave time for one

1123
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,480
or two questions from the audience and i

1124
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,759
have many more questions i'd like to ask

1125
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,199
um but why don't we direct this to

1126
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,480
daniel in the first instance and then

1127
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,679
open it up to the panel i'd like to hear

1128
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,838
from everybody quick answers though

1129
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,159
please leave questions for the audience

1130
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:43,039
uh what place or places do you see

1131
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:45,838
providing uh product for germany and

1132
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,519
switzerland uh assuming uh that peter's

1133
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,358
implication that not all the product

1134
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,519
perhaps will come internally from these

1135
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,519
countries but actually will be imported

1136
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,280
so in the united states of course um in

1137
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,159
each state particularly in regards to

1138
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,319
thc there is no transporting thc across

1139
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,639
state borders um it's it's perfectly

1140
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,719
illegal there and so that doesn't happen

1141
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,799
at all whenever you start a new uh

1142
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,039
whenever a new state in the united

1143
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,359
states emerges becomes uh legalized for

1144
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,039
recreational cannabis purposes uh

1145
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,119
operations start a novel meaning you

1146
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,599
have to build cannabis businesses from

1147
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,519
scratch in that state in order to

1148
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,280
provide cannabis to that state that's

1149
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,880
not going to be quite the same in europe

1150
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,560
i'm curious as an american just

1151
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,720
understand and i think just as a as an

1152
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,920
international business person i'm

1153
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,919
curious to know how that international

1154
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
conference is going to work so quickly

1155
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,039
aside from germany's internal production

1156
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,319
in switzerland's internal production

1157
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:35,920
where do you see most of your cannabis

1158
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,199
coming from both for the medical and

1159
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,880
recreational markets in terms of

1160
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,799
countries in europe

1161
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,800
okay i was a commodities trader so i

1162
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,440
very much believe in pricing as being

1163
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,680
the main driver so when we're talking

1164
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,358
raw materials i think maybe south africa

1165
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,440
will be a very interesting

1166
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,960
uh place maybe thailand

1167
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,039
could be very interesting

1168
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,119
um happen in the short term

1169
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,480
in in a very short time yeah like next

1170
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,720
few years

1171
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,079
all uh in switzerland everything from

1172
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,159
switzerland everything from switzerland

1173
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,560
yeah pretty much canada maybe canada

1174
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,399
maybe yeah okay uh kai or peter any

1175
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,159
thoughts on that yeah

1176
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,119
well thank you for the for the medical

1177
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,879
market we have new cultivators coming up

1178
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,680
in other european countries

1179
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,358
uh we have malta portugal not to forget

1180
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,719
spain maybe we have to see how the

1181
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,799
legalization

1182
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:23,919
legalization will work there we have

1183
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,839
greece

1184
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,639
not to forget we have northern macedonia

1185
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,559
denmark already so there are

1186
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,358
competitors to the

1187
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,880
uh

1188
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:37,440
current large exporters like canada and

1189
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,160
the netherlands into germany up coming

1190
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,880
up

1191
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,399
so

1192
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,200
for the for the

1193
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,800
recreational market i don't see any kind

1194
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:49,439
of export happening uh uh of course i i

1195
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,440
i agree with you kyrie there should be a

1196
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,240
solution but on the other hand you know

1197
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,559
we

1198
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,479
28th member state have to change the

1199
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,880
schengen contract with regard to that

1200
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,039
subject matter this will not go within a

1201
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,480
couple of months so this will take much

1202
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,480
more time as far as i can see

1203
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,960
i don't think that the schengen equity

1204
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,599
has to be changed because you can

1205
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,358
have a different interpretation on it

1206
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,960
but of course you have to talk to your

1207
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,719
european neighbors and you have to find

1208
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,800
a unanimous solution you have to

1209
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,879
convince european neighbors

1210
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,240
yeah as peter said exactly the year so

1211
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,760
in the first years in 1718 only imports

1212
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,959
from the netherlands and from canada

1213
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,720
were possible to germany and then

1214
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,318
many many other countries came online

1215
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,879
like jamaica australia ali soto

1216
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,920
european countries etc

1217
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,720
and

1218
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,240
the decisive question is the the carbon

1219
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:47,199
footprint of of cannabis i think so

1220
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:51,199
if you really have to import most of the

1221
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,159
stuff from other countries the 400 tons

1222
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:53,679
at

1223
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,519
100 times for the tourists which are

1224
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,919
coming then to germany

1225
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,920
so i would prefer that the cannabis is

1226
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,240
coming from a country with

1227
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,480
ideal climate conditions so that the

1228
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,399
carbon footprint is as

1229
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,000
low as possible

1230
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,838
because we have to think about that look

1231
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,358
look outside we have a gas crisis we

1232
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:15,599
have a ukraine war uh the next winter is

1233
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,199
going to be hard germany wouldn't be

1234
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,400
able to afford

1235
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:21,759
400 tons cultivation domestic in in

1236
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,800
germany

1237
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,640
yeah

1238
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,640
so i see we're out of time here do i can

1239
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,239
i take one question from the audience

1240
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,279
maybe two if you have a brief question

1241
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,118
you don't need to tell a whole story

1242
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,480
oh there you go yeah

1243
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,599
thank you let's hear it for the panel by

1244
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,599
the way make some noise

1245
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,519
hi good afternoon uh good morning

1246
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,440
actually uh thank you very much for the

1247
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,039
presentation i'd like to come back with

1248
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,559
you and of course to all of you

1249
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,719
gentlemen and the question that you

1250
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,759
raised peter which is quality you know

1251
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:51,759
right you know how you're going to

1252
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,920
certify this and and we're talking about

1253
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,839
some possible countries and things which

1254
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,440
already happening uh we have a company

1255
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:58,719
required uruguay sports a lot to

1256
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,800
switzerland we have a company in

1257
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,639
portugal porsche exparts a lot so it's

1258
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,720
already happening it's not like you know

1259
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,118
we have to think of so portugal has

1260
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,439
become a major exporter and as we know

1261
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,880
you know today the gold center is gmp

1262
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,920
farmer you know gold manufacturing

1263
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,079
practice of the pharmaceutical

1264
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,880
industries for those who are not allowed

1265
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,599
what's your bet gentlemen what would be

1266
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,838
the minimum requirement for producing

1267
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,760
countries being either south africa as

1268
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,440
daniel had mentioned as possible new

1269
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,119
entrants or you know existing players

1270
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,119
like uruguay and portugal

1271
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,960
well i i'd certainly take a crack at

1272
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,640
that just from the perspective of what

1273
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,240
we've seen happen in other areas of the

1274
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,920
world outside of europe it's going to

1275
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:39,199
come down to as i think

1276
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,639
kai had mentioned certainly carbon

1277
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,279
footprint but i think also it's going to

1278
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,719
come down to uh as daniel mentioned cost

1279
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,440
right ultimately

1280
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,358
the biomass is a commodity right but the

1281
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,358
brands that sit on top of the biomass

1282
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,920
whether it's it's a vape brand it's an

1283
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,358
edible brand um that's where the real ip

1284
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,599
and i think you see the discrepancy and

1285
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,920
pricing occurring right so ultimately

1286
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,519
those biomass that the commodity prices

1287
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,039
will iron out so what you're going to

1288
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,960
see is that the product will have to

1289
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,800
come from places in europe where it's

1290
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
cheaper to produce it under great

1291
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,599
conditions for growing cannabis portugal

1292
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,200
is a great example the short answer

1293
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:19,599
regarding quality is eu gmp

1294
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:21,598
i believe in eu gmp of course it is uh

1295
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,559
necessary for the business market triple

1296
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,960
doubles uh and i don't see a different

1297
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,000
quality happening for

1298
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,000
the recreational market

1299
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,559
oh sorry

1300
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,358
well i'm coming and this will be the

1301
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,119
last question because we're starting to

1302
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,558
run out of time i'm sorry

1303
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,280
go ahead

1304
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,359
quickly quickly it will be very quickly

1305
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,280
when he's speaking about augmp speaking

1306
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,000
about only the final product also for

1307
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,480
the cultivation now of course the whole

1308
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,519
process has to be eugmp compliant

1309
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,358
currently for the medicine market

1310
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:00,400
and i believe this is going to happen

1311
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,199
for

1312
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,440
the recreational market as well

1313
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,199
i don't believe that the

1314
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,079
our

1315
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,318
cultivators of of a salad at this point

1316
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,720
in time with some green houses would

1317
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:19,079
qualify for the cultivation local

1318
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,078
cultivation of cannabis here in germany

1319
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:23,598
