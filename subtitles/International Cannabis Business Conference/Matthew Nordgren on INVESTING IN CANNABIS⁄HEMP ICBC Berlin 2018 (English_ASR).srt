1
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:12,669
we've got a real heavy hitter today that

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,670
I'd really wanted to speak to you guys

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,890
he's a he's a really we're going to talk

4
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,109
about all the bunny Kai's in the

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,210
industry and who's who's who's raising

6
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:26,300
what and what's happening and all the

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,929
venture funds there's there's one group

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,118
that really stands out among the rest

9
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:35,329
Arcadian and we're fortunate enough to

10
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,109
have the founder of Arcadian here too

11
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,789
you know

12
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:41,299
who's basically been through it all and

13
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:43,010
now can talk about what's the analogy

14
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,378
for foreign and international markets

15
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,030
and what's happened domestically

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,829
we're really lucky to have him here he's

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,829
a former quarterback of the Philadelphia

18
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,719
Eagles and he is an extremely

19
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,210
accomplished young man he's only 37

20
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,730
years old and I'm really excited to have

21
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:06,079

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,090
now in different venues you do a great

30
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:30,590
job and Berlin Wow thank you for hosting

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,409
this and having us really fun experiment

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,270
yesterday which was put on some Nikes

33
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,490
and just ran around the city had never

34
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:39,798
been here before really excited to just

35
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:43,339
get in the culture and ask people

36
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,289
questions the first thing that struck me

37
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,719
was just the amount of construction here

38
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:52,218
I mean it's insane how much is being

39
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:55,188
built right one can only attribute that

40
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:58,368
to potential tax revenue from cannabis I

41
00:01:55,188 --> 00:02:01,548
guess and then Alex told me this has

42
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:04,549
been going on 20 years so it's a it's a

43
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,350
really interesting environment one that

44
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,750
I think will benefit from our industry a

45
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:14,479
lot just like the rest of the world and

46
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:15,318
like to see Berlin taking that step my

47
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,679
name is Matt

48
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:21,318
I run a fund called Arcadian exist in a

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,500
private equity group running a large

50
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,878
family office out of Los Angeles which

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,318
years ago we determined we were in the

52
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,090
right place at the right time and

53
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,399
sitting here today feel pretty good

54
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,560
about that fact I think California is a

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:39,739
market that we can prove businesses at

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:42,408
scale the name of the fund y Arcadian it

57
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,420
means rustic or rural which applies but

58
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:46,250
also to proceed without worry which I

59
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:48,919
think all of us in here have a certain

60
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,289
level of confidence that you need and I

61
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,848
think as investors you have to have even

62
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,098
additional confidence when you're

63
00:02:52,848 --> 00:03:02,209
putting a lot of dollars to work in this

64
00:02:55,098 --> 00:03:03,828
space one really interesting question

65
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,870
I'd like to pose to the group here just

66
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,150
so I can get a little bit of an idea who

67
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,379
we have in the room but I think also for

68
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,629
the rest of the room raise your hand if

69
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:18,878
you are involved in running an

70
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:18,878
opportunity or operating a business

71
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,209
well great about half the room thank you

72
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:28,878
what about how many people in here are

73
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:31,878
in search of an opportunity or investing

74
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,439
into an opportunity or a group of people

75
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,828
that are really good at something raise

76
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,829
your hand please

77
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:38,958
Wow

78
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,609
good number of invest okay everyone who

79
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,340
raised their hand first turn around and

80
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,500
figure out who those guys are we've

81
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,359
officially started dating you just have

82
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,620
to know who's who and so for me you know

83
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:53,180
knowing what kind of audience you have

84
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,949
is really important too and it sounds

85
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,989
I've got a pretty diverse group in fact

86
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:58,400
Alex told me I think there's 40

87
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,650
countries represented here I mean that's

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,590
pretty phenomenal really excited to have

89
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,419
such a such a big group of people but I

90
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,489
think you can boil it down to investors

91
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:11,870
and guys who have opportunities good to

92
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:15,229
see there's both here in my walking

93
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,720
around in Berlin yesterday another thing

94
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:21,859
happened I was looking for a gift to

95
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,950
bring home and ended up buying this book

96
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,449
that was on Jesus and God I couldn't

97
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,789
read it because it's not in my language

98
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,229
but ultimately I knew at that store

99
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,950
was so I felt like it was kind of a fun

100
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,960
gift to bring home during doing that the

101
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:37,939
guy asked me what I was in Berlin for

102
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,039
cuz I'd said I was never here and told

103
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:42,889
him why I was buying this gift I said

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,430
I'm here for cannabis business and he

105
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:48,949
told me he said you're buying a god book

106
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,530
and you're in the cannabis business that

107
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,149
doesn't seem right and it was an

108
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,919
interesting pour because I got to

109
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,289
explain to the guy that even in the

110
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,520
Bible there's about 11 or 12 verses that

111
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,530
in some way talk about this plant being

112
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,029
something that would be acceptable with

113
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,500
words like what's put on this earth

114
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,399
Smith for the consumption of mankind

115
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,290
right this was not designed by us

116
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,519
interesting conversation there which led

117
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,800
to something else that I want to talk

118
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,229
about before I get into the business of

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,550
cannabis why are we all here we're here

120
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,830
because there's something about this

121
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,500
plant that actually works and resonates

122
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:26,029
with people what is that what is the

123
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,959
opportunity let's strip everything away

124
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:33,409
and talk about why this works it's

125
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:36,169
because that plant which was given to us

126
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,090
from the dawn of inception you could

127
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,740
take everything back to algae fungi

128
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,379
bacteria you can reverse-engineer this

129
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,269
stuff and figure that out I am a God guy

130
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,600
personally but I think science is pretty

131
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:50,449
well proven that we all came from algae

132
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,879
fungi and bacteria in the very early

133
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,209
stages of all civilization that we know

134
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,939
today

135
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:57,680
this plant happens to produce something

136
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,800
that our body naturally produces and

137
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,019
that's the cannabinoids right so if you

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,879
think about this it's so natural it

139
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:07,579
works with our body perfectly like a

140
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,639
puzzle piece that exists in the world

141
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:12,409
that is created naturally that can do

142
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,909
wonderful things for us so I think you

143
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,370
have to think about this business and

144
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,110
really strip away down to the science

145
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,280
what is the plant and the plant is a

146
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,590
technology people think of this is going

147
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,689
to be commoditized one day and maybe the

148
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:29,750
whole plant ends up being somewhat of a

149
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:32,540
commodity and prices drop but the plant

150
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,610
technology the science the the the bio

151
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,460
science that chemical properties in the

152
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,379
make up the make up the plant are where

153
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:41,389
the real opportunity is figuring out how

154
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,560
each of those interact with the human

155
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:47,680
body and what you can do

156
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,680
to benefit the world off the back of it

157
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:54,769
really interesting story that I think

158
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,629
you guys would enjoy our one of our big

159
00:06:54,769 --> 00:07:00,199
investors got married in the Vatican

160
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,089
recently and in order to do that you

161
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,189
actually have to disclose everything

162
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,259
about your life to get approval to be

163
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,939
married in the Vatican he had to

164
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,269
disclose the fact that he produced a

165
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:15,800
large amount of cannabis very

166
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:17,959
interesting point Pope issued from the

167
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,910
Pope's office issued a statement that

168
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:24,349
the Pope has no problem with cannabis

169
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,150
this is like the most I can't wait for

170
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,680
this to hit the papers and I'm one of

171
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:29,269
the owners of High Times and cannabis

172
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,650
cup and I hope we get to publish it but

173
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:33,168
this is a fact

174
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:35,509
this just came back we he was allowed to

175
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:39,259
get married in there and the official

176
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:41,060
statement was in moderation we have no

177
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,610
we think about cannabis just like we do

178
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,168
alcohol and tobacco great I can't wait

179
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,379
to go back to Texas and tell all my

180
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:51,219
Christian conservative Republicans there

181
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:53,538
that story the point of all this is

182
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,340
before we can really understand the

183
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:58,069
business I think you have to understand

184
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:01,369
what this plant is what it can do at the

185
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:05,060
science level what where the plant came

186
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:07,310
from and why it's been withheld from us

187
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,350
for so many years it's not created that

188
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,329
way it's business it's Pharma it's

189
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,700
politics there's other reasons that

190
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:15,409
haven't allowed it to be available now

191
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,959
the world has a voice and it will be

192
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,389
what are you gonna do to capitalize on

193
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:27,680
that opportunity while doing a great

194
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:31,550
thing in talking about some of those

195
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,459
cannabinoids there's about 125 or so in

196
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,469
the plant we still don't really know a

197
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:39,019
lot of research has to happen for us to

198
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,520
feel comfortable but I think that's

199
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:44,269
coming and we haven't had the resources

200
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:46,610
to do it which we now are THC CBD we

201
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:49,309
talked about a lot in here what are the

202
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,310
ramifications of those two isolated

203
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:56,119
cannabinoid molecules don't forget about

204
00:08:52,309 --> 00:09:00,189
CB c CB g CB g a CB n ste

205
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,899
a CA th cbcb da

206
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:08,210
every one of these has a tremendous

207
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:11,569
effect on the body cbv appetite

208
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:14,930
suppressant it's one of my favorite

209
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,250
thing to talk to new cannabis people

210
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,329
that want to learn about the plant

211
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,519
there's actually an appetite suppressant

212
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:26,990
molecule in there like who would have

213
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:30,019
thought of that but that exists so what

214
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:36,110
is the opportunity I see the cannabis

215
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:38,539
opportunity in three main phases the

216
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,669
first phase and every market sort of

217
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:43,278
that we've studied starts this way and

218
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:45,620
kind of grows at its own pace depending

219
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,330
on politics but eventually they all kind

220
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,830
of grow the same way in order for there

221
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,650
to be an industry have to have

222
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:57,020
cultivation have to have some sort of

223
00:09:51,649 --> 00:10:00,129
retail and have to manufacture it I see

224
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:04,458
that as always as phase number one as

225
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:06,230
that starts to scale which we see now in

226
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,449
the United States and through Canada or

227
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:12,500
starting to see consolidation you

228
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:16,089
eventually do see prices respond

229
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,129
accordingly which would be decrease

230
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:22,459
phase two which I think happens just

231
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:25,610
after you create the basic fundamentals

232
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:29,208
of a new industry is the servicing

233
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,159
aspect once you have the plant in your

234
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,989
market once you have a place you can buy

235
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:36,019
it whether it's physician or a retail

236
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,159
establishment what about the data how do

237
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:43,278
we understand our consumer what about

238
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:45,860
customer retention how do we continue to

239
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:49,689
use it use that information to service

240
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,278
our customers what about media events

241
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,950
what about different kinds of software

242
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:57,889
that exists in every other industry with

243
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,089
the stigma around this one those big

244
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,389
companies don't feel comfortable

245
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,400
addressing the cannabis industry until a

246
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:09,370
point in time so I think you have a

247
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,769
second wave of opportunity in the server

248
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,159
seeing an ancillary category the third

249
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:16,059
ends up being off the back of that once

250
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,860
everything gets figured out in the

251
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:20,319
industry the machines built now you have

252
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,659
brands all sorts of opportunities off

253
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,670
the back end I kind of think about it

254
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,429
like gold mining right it's a typical

255
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:28,990
example you hear a lot in this industry

256
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,309
go back to the gold miners right there

257
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,399
has to be gold for there to be a

258
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:35,679
business right without cannabis we don't

259
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,419
or cannabinoids however you get them we

260
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,278
don't have a business but ultimately

261
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,669
those gold miners need picks and shovels

262
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,320
and boots and jeans in order to function

263
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:46,809
Levi's jeans for example started that

264
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,710
way and is still around then ultimately

265
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:52,359
you have to have a consumer for the gold

266
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:56,050
you got to have a ring you got to have a

267
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,879
watch right so I think cannabis industry

268
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,129
can be seen in similar phases you have

269
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,659
to have the gold you have to have ways

270
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:03,600
to run the business and then you got to

271
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:09,699
ultimately have a variety of consumers

272
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,409
to utilize the product within those

273
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,089
categories I think you have three

274
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:18,219
additional markets to address which is

275
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,300
medical we talked a lot about that in

276
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,950
here today because this is a medical

277
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:23,889
market you have the over-the-counter

278
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,620
market nutraceuticals and then you have

279
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:28,539
recreational we've seen this evolve in

280
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,278
every market as well similarly to the

281
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,490
different phases of the industry that

282
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:35,669
grow in the market you end up having

283
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,930
regulations set in that typically put

284
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:39,789
products in those three categories if

285
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:43,088
you can meet a certain level of

286
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:45,519
regulation no pesticide problems things

287
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,029
like that and you don't have any further

288
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,370
study

289
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:50,169
well now you probably have a

290
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,028
recreational product that you can infuse

291
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:55,000
in anything in the grocery store based

292
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:58,689
on a very low hurdle of regulation the

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,669
next hurdle might be such that you have

294
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,339
an over-the-counter product product that

295
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:04,929
you can charge a little bit more for has

296
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,540
gone through a certain level of study

297
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:09,639
but ultimately not enough to be

298
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:10,899
qualified as true medical product true

299
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,338
medical product will be the third

300
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:14,528
category where you have to go through a

301
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,390
rigorous amount of clinical trial

302
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:19,029
research and study in order to be

303
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,799
approved at that level of regulation so

304
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,019
I think you ultimately also see a

305
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,939
variety of levels

306
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:28,029
of product what does that ultimately

307
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,390
mean I think that means that every

308
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:35,589
person on planet Earth is a cannabinoid

309
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:37,389
consumer one day no disrespect to Henry

310
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,639
Rollins who said he's never touched it

311
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:40,870
before earlier no disrespect to the

312
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,710
gentleman who was just here hasn't

313
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,759
smoked in 20 years but I do think that

314
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,139
everybody when they understand the

315
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,850
science of this and they understand

316
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:51,580
where the industry is going I do think

317
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,170
you will see cannabinoid in every

318
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,000
product in every grocery store in

319
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:58,240
America think about b12

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,460
what's b12 well you all love it Omega

321
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,779
fish oil all these wonderful things that

322
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,440
have been proven to do some pretty

323
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,669
interesting effects for the human body

324
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,350
will happen in cannabis to those

325
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:10,899
cannabinoids I mentioned earlier you

326
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,220
might see c-23 who knows what they're

327
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,470
gonna brand it is but it'll pass a

328
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,139
certain level of regulation if it's just

329
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,210
medical it'll be a certification you

330
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,919
could put on a product because you can

331
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,870
isolate it and extract it now you can

332
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,099
infuse it in literally anything in the

333
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,929
grocery store then you could put that

334
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,460
brand on it so I do think that everybody

335
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:33,129
has the cannabis as the new salt

336
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,450
somebody said in my class one of my lot

337
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,919
of speeches and I thought that was

338
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,990
actually pretty interesting to think

339
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,089
about this way right I mean fungi

340
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,590
there's actually 10 times more amount of

341
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,750
fungi on planet Earth and there are

342
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,820
plants people don't realize the

343
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,559
symbiotic relationship that the fungi

344
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,660
has in the roots with the delivery of

345
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:56,669
oxygen and nutrients and all those other

346
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:59,439
things cannabinoid is a very basic human

347
00:14:56,669 --> 00:15:00,579
element that we produce ourselves that

348
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,870
we can naturally get from the

349
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,990
environment so I think you have to look

350
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:07,179
at how big this industry can be and I do

351
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:14,629
think it will be everywhere in the world

352
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:18,149
at some level how I go about

353
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:20,720
investing in this space that's the

354
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:24,359
question we had to ask ourselves in

355
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,470
phase one things that require a license

356
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:30,809
things that touch the plant we felt that

357
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,879
the opportunity for that is in some

358
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:34,980
markets and most markets federally

359
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,678
illegal not something we could do in the

360
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,528
family office so we decided to look at

361
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:43,528
Phase two which was those businesses

362
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:45,720
that get built around it what we decide

363
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:47,220
to do from that standpoint was focus on

364
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,470
companies that have been around for a

365
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,129
number of years and have revenue growth

366
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,949
and can certify that they are in

367
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:58,139
compliance with federal law so we became

368
00:15:55,948 --> 00:16:00,149
a good place for the industry's most

369
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,339
successful ancillary companies to come

370
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:05,999
to in order to receive capital but also

371
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:08,249
a big private equity firms experience on

372
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:11,040
what it means to provide growth equity

373
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:14,069
and then how do you prepare yourself for

374
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,230
the next phase a lot of our companies

375
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:19,159
are starting to mature high times we'll

376
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,209
have an offer on NASDAQ very soon

377
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,948
similar thesis with the rest of our

378
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:26,548
companies you get a company that's at

379
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:29,338
scale get liquidity get public currency

380
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:31,110
have some form of consolidation and then

381
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,569
you go out and try to provide capital

382
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,459
and other resources to other in other

383
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:40,498
businesses in that same vertical in

384
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:41,909
order to scale high x has no it doesn't

385
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,829
think it's the end-all be-all for

386
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:47,039
everybody it services a very specific

387
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:48,448
type of cannabis customer but the good

388
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,519
news is if you subscribe to the theory

389
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:52,918
that cannabinoids is the future then

390
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,198
that means every single person fits in

391
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:57,720
the cannabinoid category and everybody

392
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,519
has a different profile so everyone has

393
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,350
to be catered to differently now high x

394
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,209
can provide capital to those companies

395
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,130
and ultimately let them all grow in

396
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:07,109
service various demographic and

397
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,819
geographic regions so I think you're

398
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,048
going to see a lot of consolidation in

399
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:13,528
this industry you're seeing it right now

400
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:15,558
on the plant touching side think

401
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:18,509
valuations are as high as they'll be

402
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:20,730
over this next year or two and then I

403
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:23,459
think you see two three four years after

404
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,470
that consolidation of all the ancillary

405
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,000
companies and then two-three years after

406
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:32,730
that I think you started to seek

407
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,549
solid ation of brands one interesting

408
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,539
thing I think I always try to point out

409
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:39,240
based on all the things we've been

410
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:42,750
talking about the wide use of this plant

411
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,539
is that everybody's skill set is

412
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,579
transferable to cannabis there is so

413
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:49,649
much business opportunity and those of

414
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,049
us that have gotten in it early I think

415
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,490
have the most likelihood of success but

416
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,109
ultimately we want to encourage

417
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,720
everybody to be in this industry whether

418
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:00,959
you're graphic designer a tomato farm or

419
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,460
a finance person this industry requires

420
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,170
all of us in order to make it work the

421
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,240
one thing I can say based on that is

422
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,610
that I think the companies and the

423
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,339
people that I've seen not do well are

424
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:16,319
the ones that aren't very niche focused

425
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,579
it's very easy to get distracted in this

426
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,369
industry because there's a lot of great

427
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,509
things to do but I do think you know

428
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:23,219
what we're looking for and we're

429
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:25,019
investing in a company as somebody who's

430
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,900
solving a very specific problem at a

431
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:30,150
very high level right there is no

432
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,940
regulated business in the entire world

433
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,700
that you can do everything they regulate

434
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:39,059
it for a reason and it will be separated

435
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,450
into various points along the supply

436
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,549
chain

437
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,860
I think this industry will be the exact

438
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,569
same mostly because they like to tax it

439
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,879
but they also like to just regulate it

440
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:50,159
and keep control of things so I think

441
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,020
you have to solve specific pain points

442
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,029
you have to be really really really good

443
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,819
at something I don't think you can do it

444
00:18:54,029 --> 00:19:02,029
all in our companies and our CEOs have

445
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:02,029
been proven to do that very well

446
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:14,668
what are some of those companies well I

447
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,200
can I kind of break the industry down

448
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:20,609
into a few segments you have production

449
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,798
you have cultivation you have

450
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:24,598
manufacturing phase one the ones that we

451
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,038
like to look at in the second phase our

452
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:34,249
business software business services

453
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:36,479
social media online media print media

454
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:41,038
vaporizers and accessories production

455
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:43,588
equipment and supplies HR data there's

456
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,209
an immense amount of industry that needs

457
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:47,668
to come into cannabis in order for it to

458
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:51,269
grow properly those are the type of

459
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:53,788
companies were looking for what's

460
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:55,259
interesting enough that happens is these

461
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:55,950
companies that are a couple years down

462
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:59,038
the road

463
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,078
for example let's use a company called

464
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,828
BDS analytics that were involved with

465
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:06,569
they're a point of sale data company

466
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:09,538
point-of-sale data exists everywhere

467
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:11,848
else but it doesn't exist in the space

468
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:14,338
because the big players Nielsen in the

469
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:16,078
United States for example doesn't feel

470
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,178
comfortable servicing the space so I can

471
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:20,098
go into a company and look at a company

472
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,409
that's got two three years of proven

473
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:25,950
revenue that I think is probably worth a

474
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,570
10 12 15 multiple based on what happens

475
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,149
if you're not servicing cannabis and

476
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:31,798
Nielsen was going to buy you for example

477
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:33,808
but because they service cannabis for a

478
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,908
proven business we'll get a five

479
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:38,788
multiple six multiple seven multiple we

480
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:41,519
basically get a 50% discount on a proven

481
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:44,158
business that has no legal constraints

482
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,979
and if we guess right and that company

483
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,629
ends up being the market winter when

484
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,519
Nielsen and those companies are ready to

485
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:52,798
buy I guarantee you they're big enough

486
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,528
they don't care the price they know they

487
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,628
have to have market share and they'll be

488
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:59,368
willing to buy the market so then you

489
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:01,348
have to ask yourself what companies

490
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:04,108
aren't attractive on an exit and what

491
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:06,118
are and that's ultimately a funds fund

492
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:07,918
manager and a fund investment committees

493
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:10,108
decision to try to sort through for

494
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,869
example banking banking is a major pain

495
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:14,878
point insurance major pain point the

496
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:17,968
likelihood that those don't get solved

497
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:21,269
is very low also the likelihood that

498
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:22,169
they want to buy an insurance or a bank

499
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:23,579
business

500
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:25,499
that's been around a couple years and

501
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,849
cannabis is also pretty low because

502
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:28,350
they'll be able to offer those exact

503
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:30,178
same products so from an investment

504
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:32,699
standpoint we decided not to pursue

505
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,528
those because of that factor although

506
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,879
they are pain points lots of pain points

507
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:38,368
just have to figure out the ones that

508
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:43,168
ultimately have value at the end of the

509
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:48,658
day we want to want to leave some time

510
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:50,700
for some questions but why am i up here

511
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,210
talking to you about all this I think

512
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,278
the answer probably is because if you're

513
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,259
gonna have chips in this space everybody

514
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,679
in here probably has a unique skill set

515
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:04,108
or a reason why they're in it having

516
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,179
exposure to a fund which I run one

517
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:08,368
there's multiple great funds there's

518
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,809
another investment group here Nick who's

519
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:12,269
speaking tomorrow his group's great

520
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:13,798
there's there's about 10 other funds in

521
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:17,519
the United States I think are at our

522
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:20,700
level all of them can give you exposure

523
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:24,028
to the space in a hedged way can get you

524
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,460
access to lots of great resources and

525
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:29,398
brainpower ultimately only making

526
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,249
whatever it is you decide to do a better

527
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:33,778
strategy by having a big shop with the

528
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:36,269
machine built around you to help grow

529
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:38,579
that business so I hope you do decide to

530
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:40,589
talk to somebody who runs a big

531
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:42,778
investment shops but focus on this space

532
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:44,368
because I do think it helps everybody

533
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:48,148
with whatever they're trying to do

534
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:52,108
individually really excited to be here

535
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:54,868
again I want to make one last point

536
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:58,230
which is I'm a whole plant guy and I

537
00:22:54,868 --> 00:23:00,298
love the whole plant people and I'll

538
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,940
never change right that that's that's

539
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:05,608
sort of how I came into the industry as

540
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,230
being that type of consumer but look at

541
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:09,329
the United States market it's estimated

542
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:13,169
there's about 25 million consumers of

543
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:16,378
cannabis United States market 325

544
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:18,509
million people there so if we have an

545
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:19,980
objective to get this plant in the hands

546
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:22,499
of every single person we're gonna have

547
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,599
to understand what that means if this

548
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:26,608
room had a hundred people based on the

549
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,278
American numbers today which is a pretty

550
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:34,470
good market to scale thirteen percent

551
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:35,640
our current users or potential users of

552
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,049
the flower so

553
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,240
need to service that community that's a

554
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:42,059
lot of people 25 million is a big number

555
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,730
but there's 300 million other people

556
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:47,819
that will be new consumers how will they

557
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,620
be introduced to the cannabinoid crop if

558
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:51,750
you walk to room 100 people ninety

559
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:53,609
eighty seven other people would be very

560
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,099
tough to say hey you should come to

561
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:59,119
cannabis and just enroll at this plant

562
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:01,589
and smoke it now guy like me probably

563
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,299
would try to argue that but ultimately

564
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:04,559
it's about making sure that everybody

565
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:07,409
has a product that they're comfortable

566
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,419
with so those other 87% of people what

567
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,890
are we going to create for them is it

568
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,750
inedible is the topical is it a

569
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,340
sublingual I don't know but the

570
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,009
important thing is that everybody has

571
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,709
access to this cannabinoid whole plant

572
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:21,210
and business guys are trying to find

573
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,090
other ways to do that I hope we can all

574
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,710
have the same mission which is move this

575
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:37,859
industry forward thank you for having me

576
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:41,250
I met so let's plan for two more

577
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:43,109
additional questions I think then the

578
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:50,359
next panel is already starting so are

579
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:50,359
there any questions okay

580
00:24:53,359 --> 00:25:01,129
hi Hendricks from where or where we

581
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,889
currently in Europe if you compare the

582
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,500
u.s. to Europe in terms of private

583
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,030
equity or venture capital great question

584
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:12,259
and the opportunity for investment funds

585
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:15,109
is really there because of the

586
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:18,859
institutional investors aren't really in

587
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:21,740
the space yet so I think even in America

588
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:23,419
you don't have that for Europe but

589
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,640
you're in phase one right you're trying

590
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,769
to still figure out how you're gonna

591
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,360
grow it where you're gonna sell it how

592
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,089
it's going to be manufacturers so you're

593
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,339
kind of in that first phase so depending

594
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:36,230
on the market the opportunity is just

595
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:37,699
where the market dictates Mexico we

596
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,870
helped write Mexico's policy we know

597
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,069
there's a handful of families that are

598
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,989
about to be announced that have that

599
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:43,700
they're at square one they're gonna

600
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,890
import from Canada for six to nine

601
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,798
months the likelihood that they need

602
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,049
services is not very high right now it's

603
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,359
a few years down the road so I think in

604
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:55,039
Europe you know your steps beyond that

605
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,959
but you're getting to the point now

606
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,819
where you want to understand data right

607
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,169
we heard people talk today about Germany

608
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:02,569
there's a business here and there's

609
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:04,640
20,000 but no one knows the data behind

610
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,200
them so I think the opportunity in

611
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,700
Europe is you can still get your hands

612
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,340
on great licensed businesses at a decent

613
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,450
a decent price and you can be on that

614
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:14,480
side there's but I do think the real

615
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:17,660
opportunity is in the next wave of

616
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,630
businesses you know I you can't even

617
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,880
find hardly a vape pen in Europe it's so

618
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,290
crazy right you know in California which

619
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,580
is the other benefit actually about

620
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:30,289
being in California you can you can test

621
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:33,048
businesses across every vertical in this

622
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:35,298
industry at scale right you have 35

623
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:36,529
million people you have 200 something

624
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:39,168
million that come through there every

625
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:42,200
year we've got a great market to test

626
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:44,480
any philosophy at massive scale to see

627
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,100
if it's gonna work so we like to use

628
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,470
California's a bit of a testing ground

629
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:49,939
which I think we've done and then I

630
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,009
think the next step for us we are

631
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,360
launching a European fund right now in

632
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:55,308
order to take everything we've built

633
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,369
here into the European market off the

634
00:26:55,308 --> 00:27:00,668
back of the growth of the basic part of

635
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,668
the industry

636
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:17,369
that would be time for one more question

637
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:19,750
sir okay last question please yeah

638
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:23,019
Francesca Empress pharmaceutical

639
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:26,170
Switzerland yeah I got a question but

640
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:29,139
it's not for pharma stuff because

641
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,690
actually we're talking since the

642
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:35,740
beginning about just a business of the

643
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:37,779
buds I mean the extracts everything but

644
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,900
we're not speaking about the

645
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:43,539
opportunities on the business on the old

646
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:47,080
plants you know because actually the

647
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:51,399
point is you might know it financially

648
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:56,039
speaking actually as well for design as

649
00:27:51,400 --> 00:28:00,009
well for materials bio plastics and

650
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:03,099
fewers and I mean that's a lot of

651
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:06,009
opportunities not just on buds I mean

652
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:08,980
the amp is like pork you can take out

653
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:12,099
everything you want even the roots we

654
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:15,190
can say over here in Europe with the Sun

655
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:18,129
most in the south we can say that

656
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:22,059
actually the plants reach 4 meters I'd

657
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:25,060
right even even 5 even 7 so the roots

658
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:28,720
are really big so you can even take

659
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:31,480
words out of it really right word so you

660
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,039
can make everything out of it so I mean

661
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,829
the financial potency of the business

662
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,889
should not be just concentrated into

663
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:44,559
buds but everywhere else because there's

664
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:48,250
a lot of job to do there's a lot of work

665
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,799
to do as well a lot of my friends are

666
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:54,069
working in Europe and as well worldwide

667
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:57,669
to develop a lot of materials new

668
00:28:54,069 --> 00:29:01,089
material new resins new stuff to do be

669
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:04,870
bio tanks I mean so that will be really

670
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:09,099
huge stuff to do if everybody over here

671
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:11,679
you know just yeah I think that's that's

672
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:12,969
part without going into all the business

673
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,400
opportunities that's exactly what I'm

674
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,240
trying to express up here which is the

675
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,890
massive

676
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,940
of opportunities exist which are talking

677
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,740
about in fact I have a friend in the

678
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,930
industry who actually put together a

679
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,130
business plan and I don't know if he got

680
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,450
in front of him or not but he's trying

681
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,130
to put it in front of the White House to

682
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,420
say hey if you're gonna build a wall

683
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,810
why don't you dude out hempcrete at

684
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:35,800
least right hey deucey and it's a bit of

685
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:37,960
a joke but again right if if we could

686
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,909
ever get there who knows but hey

687
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,160
laughter is the best form of medicine

688
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,830
cannabis certainly could be a medicine

689
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,300
in that regard but I agree with you and

690
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:49,210
I think that we should all walk away

691
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:51,849
with that thought that there are so much

692
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,440
business opportunity it's not just whole

693
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:55,659
plant that's the people who are

694
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,820
advocating it today understand whole

695
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,590
plant benefit to them but as this

696
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:01,269
industry moves forward I challenge you

697
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,699
all to think about what is the consumer

698
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:05,589
look like today what does it look like

699
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,970
tomorrow what does it look like five and

700
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:08,789
ten years from now because it's a

701
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,500
completely different answer an

702
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:14,109
understanding what hemp can do with its

703
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,599
byproducts understanding you know the

704
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:18,429
the the cannabinoid profiles and what

705
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:22,299
each of them can do that's where the

706
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:24,130
industry is going so if anybody in here

707
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:26,079
is running a business that's at scale

708
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,580
that meets our criteria I'd love to know

709
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,109
yeah we're looking for great

710
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:31,089
opportunities we've been able to raise a

711
