extractions and Dr Marcus fight will

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,120
give us a very scientific Insight in the

41
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,439
uh cannabis extraction and about in the

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,480
pharmaceutical standards of cannabis

43
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,479
extraction is that right

44
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:23,878
Marcos okay oh you don't have a

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,160
microphone oh okay so I have correct I

46
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,518
I'm not in the um extraction um services

47
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,959
so um alphat toopics is providing

48
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,280
training and

49
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,840
consultancy uh for Herbal medicinal

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,719
products and my background is um

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,439
university but I also did a lot of um um

52
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,039
support in approval of Botanicals and

53
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,919
herbal medicine products in my career I

54
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:50,719
was involved in over 100 projects for

55
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,559
registration of herbal medicinal

56
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,639
products also the first herbal medicinal

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,000
product which was approved by the FDA

58
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:02,639
which was verin um um I was involved and

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,719
yes um so this is my background but I'm

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,119
not in the

61
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,039
extraction um

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,158
industry you know a lot about extraction

63
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,400
this is what uh I could hear from the

64
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,878
talk and I'm we had before this panel

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,400
and I'm very keen to hear more details

66
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:23,239
but let me introduce Marcos uh Dr Marcus

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,158
R first hello Marcos hello the other one

68
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,200
exactly another Marcos Marcos is from

69
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:29,919
Canada uh from the from the country

70
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:33,238
where cannabis is already legal for uh

71
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,639
for five six six years now and he's the

72
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,640
founder of uh controlled chemistry he's

73
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,119
dedicated to uh canab research and of

74
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,798
course to production aren't you uh yes I

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,200
do all the weird and wonderful chemistry

76
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,159
of cannabis and uh what is your uh your

77
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,759
company dedicated to what's your role in

78
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:54,039
the in the Canadian Market at the moment

79
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,479
um so I'm in Canada because Canada it's

80
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,919
legal and I have the regulatory

81
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,719
framework to play around with all

82
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:03,719
cannabis um I'm German originally

83
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,878
uh so we do and chemistry is like

84
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,519
General Science right um cannabis will

85
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,518
behave chemically the same way in any

86
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,120
country so we can do the research in

87
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,959
Canada but it's applicable to any place

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,439
around the world and so we act as a

89
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
contract research organization uh for

90
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,959
the Cannabis industry and cannabis

91
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,759
curious companies um to solve their

92
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,280
various chemistry

93
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,120
problems yeah thank you and uh I think

94
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,038
uh it's very good to have your

95
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,478
experience here because your Market is

96
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:35,639
already existing while our Market is

97
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,319
still developing yes I come from the

98
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,280
future uh but we already have a medical

99
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,439
Market here in Germany most of you know

100
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,319
we have that Medical Market and it's a

101
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,000
meanwhile it's a very liberal Market I

102
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,599
would call it it's a very close uh I

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,160
could nearly compare to the US market

104
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,439
because it's not as complicated any M

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,960
prescription and we have over 200,000

106
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,680
patients now here which is really a very

107
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,478
very huge

108
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,360
increase

109
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:10,560
but our community doctors most companies

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,960
and also patients they do so as if

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,478
cannabis only exists of THC and CBD

112
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,599
which is not the the case anybody of of

113
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:24,439
us Who's involved in the topic knows

114
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:28,280
that a human has an endocrin system and

115
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,478
not only THC and CBD play a major role

116
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,198
but also all the other components

117
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,038
cannabis contains the canab needes and

118
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,879
the terpanes play a role when it comes

119
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:42,079
to the um medical

120
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:46,600
use but in Germany does anybody know a

121
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:48,839
company who uh labels turs or canab

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
weats I don't know I don't know a

123
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,719
company and we have meanwhile we have

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,360
420 strs in the pharmacy we also have

125
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,120
extracts in the pharmacy and I really I

126
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:05,199
do not quite understand why companies

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,160
patients doctors wholesalers and the

128
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,120
whole Branch

129
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,000
doesn't doesn't uh uh concentrate on the

130
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,038
canab need and the turps more here in

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,439
Germany because I know in Canada and the

132
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:20,439
US it's a very big thing and so let me

133
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:23,360
ask Dr Marcus fight why is that so um

134
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,360
that's a regulatory issue because um of

135
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
course companies are free to label

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,919
further cannabinoids and also to label

137
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,719
certain terpenoids

138
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,318
um but um from a regulatory point of

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,440
view as you label it it must be part of

140
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,960
the specification it must be tested uh

141
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,000
for this you need validated test methods

142
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,598
and from a formal point of view any of

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,800
this additionally labeled components are

144
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:51,199
apis active pharmaceutical ingredients

145
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,960
and uh and therefore they need to be

146
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,879
prescribed so if you label one more

147
00:06:53,959 --> 00:07:00,079
turpenoid or one more cap cannabinoid we

148
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:04,199
do have single patient prescription here

149
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:08,318
in Germany MDS need to prescribe exactly

150
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:12,680
this product um labeled with um more

151
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,919
than CBD and um THC and this is also a

152
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,639
matter of the phacil monograph because

153
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:23,198
there's a misund understanding that um

154
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:25,639
only um flowers or extracts um really

155
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,919
fitting to this monograph could be

156
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,319
marketed but this is not true it's a

157
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,799
it's a it's a prescription and doctors

158
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,759
are free to prescribe anything and the

159
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,960
monographs provide um a kind of a

160
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,960
framework for minimum quality so in

161
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,878
minimum CBD and THC needs to be labeled

162
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,799
but it could be more so this is possible

163
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:52,280
but difficult because so if if a doctor

164
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,598
is a trained for example and at the

165
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,799
moment it's considered probably as extra

166
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,319
work because a doctor would have to put

167
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,960
like five turbs on and five cabinates on

168
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,479
the prescription extra which is a doctor

169
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,439
doesn't write they don't like to write a

170
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,399
lot I know that when it comes to

171
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,759
prescriptions so if you teach a doctor

172
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,439
if you train doctors how to it's it

173
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,120
would be possible yes and of course it

174
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,000
must be tested so it must be part of the

175
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,918
specification so the effort you have um

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,639
to release these products for the market

177
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:23,799
and this must be done by a qualified

178
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,960
person uh in Germany is more so you need

179
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,639
more analytical effort to test for this

180
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,000
and you also need bat to batch

181
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,278
consistency because you have to label

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,200
exactly what is in it and this must to

183
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:39,158
be batch to batch

184
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,800
consistent yeah that's a lot of fun so

185
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:44,080
uh yeah so having cannabis as a

186
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,719
biological product that has its own

187
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,000
batto batch variability uh keeping it

188
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,240
consistent becomes difficult from a

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
growing aspect so oils would offer

190
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,240
themselves better to make a consistent

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,159
product but even if you extract cannabis

192
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,240
you get batto batch variability

193
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,159
um so you can do multivariant uh

194
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,519
multifactorial

195
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:11,000
optimizations but I fear that the

196
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,360
Cannabis industry is in its infancy to

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,399
to learn all the cool tricks that other

198
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,759
areas or other Industries have already

199
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:24,919
figured out so um making an extract that

200
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:27,078
is more than just THC and CBD and

201
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,799
prescribable is difficult it's not

202
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,278
impossible but it's difficult and you

203
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,439
not only have to educate the consumer

204
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,919
and the doctor but also the producers

205
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,600
and so like everyone has to learn what

206
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:42,599
role does canab need and turp content or

207
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,839
labeling play on the Canadian Market on

208
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,399
the medical market and on the

209
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:51,279
recreational Market

210
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:53,879
is so in Canada the um qualitative

211
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,919
compounds cannaboids tpin they can be

212
00:09:53,879 --> 00:10:01,519
tested and labeled by the producer only

213
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:03,120
the um compounds of concern pesticides

214
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,120
heavy metals they have to be tested by a

215
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,360
third party

216
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,959
Laboratory um so as long as the producer

217
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,320
is kind of okay right with the answer

218
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,479
they're fine so you see labeling of THC

219
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,920
21 to

220
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,959
26% they just put that on their package

221
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,679
and it will be okay the the flower will

222
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:26,319
be somewhere in there and

223
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,639
uh the producer also makes themsel

224
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,120
Easier by just keeping as little

225
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,559
information on the package as possible

226
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,879
so that they can reuse the packaging and

227
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,239
they are within specs every time uh

228
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,679
where you see a lot of new cannaboids is

229
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,879
in the US market in the hemp space

230
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,319
because cannabis is illegal in the US

231
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:50,320
but hemp is legal and hemp is everything

232
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:53,399
except Delta 9 THC so now there is a a

233
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,560
wild race to make the next intoxicating

234
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,039
non Delta 9 THC

235
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,399
cannaboid uh and we're testing it on

236
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:02,360
people if they are safe

237
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,600
uh so there you see loads of labeled

238
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,759
cannaboids okay but that's a very

239
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,600
different approach than our approach

240
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:13,439
here on the uh when it comes to medical

241
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,639
cannabis uh Marcus uh yes um one point

242
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,800
is important uh regarding the statement

243
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:24,240
of Marcos because in Germany we are not

244
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:26,679
free to label um u a corridor of um 12

245
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,320
to 18% or something like that because we

246
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,759
do have legal requirements for herb

247
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,440
medicinal products and the the widest

248
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,759
range which is possible is plusus 10% so

249
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,959
any additional um cannabinoid you would

250
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,439
like to label or any additional turboid

251
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,958
you would like to label would need to

252
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,839
stay in this plusus 10 Corridor um and

253
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,439
this is an effort uh so and this is

254
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,480
could be only achieved with standardized

255
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,639
uh conditions um in cultivation and for

256
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,000
extracts also in extraction yeah and you

257
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,919
actually get into the problem that if

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,720
you want to label minor avonoids and

259
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,319
Turpin uh they are so low in

260
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,040
concentration that your 10% area or area

261
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,519
is outside of the analytical specs they

262
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,879
can achieve so like the test isn't as

263
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,399
precise enough to make it within the 10%

264
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:21,240
anyway okay so what would you

265
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,120
recommend a German uh uh wholesaler or a

266
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,399
German uh

267
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,320
Pharmacy if they want to focus on a

268
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,679
special

269
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,240
canab for example like charlot swep you

270
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:36,638
know that that that strain that has the

271
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,079
special can of need against epilepsy and

272
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,959
you don't need actually so much CHD but

273
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:43,799
this is not mentioned in the in Germany

274
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,958
so what what would you recommend a

275
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,399
producer who's going to uh who wants to

276
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,719
focus on can needs he can do so uh but

277
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,278
in the end to sell the product he needs

278
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,879
to have a doctor prescribing it so in

279
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,639
Germany you have this situation without

280
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,078
a prescription you will not sell a

281
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,440
single product so you have to convince

282
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,120
doctors of your Concepts and you have to

283
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,959
stick to the regulations and uh this is

284
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,440
diff different to Canada and the US we

285
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:13,679
do have very detailed regulations for

286
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,839
Herbal medicinal products and they apply

287
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:21,359
for mistro preparations in total um so

288
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,880
um a company must be capable to to do

289
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,240
this um yes standardization not only for

290
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,600
one cannabinoid but also for for others

291
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,198
which might be better better for a given

292
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,920
indication um and this um is knoow is

293
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:40,919
needed for that you have to mix batches

294
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,799
of flowers you have to mix batches of um

295
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,559
extracts um you have to know your

296
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,599
process very well to be to be sure to

297
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,758
have a batch to batch consistent product

298
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,680
which reaches the patient in the end ask

299
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,839
your

300
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:59,278
chemist um so despite it's not as easy

301
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,759
as let me say in other markets you you

302
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,600
concentrated or you focused on canab

303
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,320
needs uh and you pre you prepared a

304
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,720
little presentation for us uh like

305
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,320
focused on the canab eat uh issue on the

306
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,320
German market and I'm really proud that

307
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,360
you give us this presentation because

308
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,720
your scientific background is really

309
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,519
unique and I was impressed when I when

310
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
we met in the green room before the

311
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,000
panel uh I learned a lot in those five

312
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,639
minutes so please I'm really looking

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,639
forward to your presentation

314
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,078
yeah Thomas is going to give us a little

315
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,198
presentation about his company not about

316
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,519
his company about my

317
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:44,919
company I just um tried to summarize um

318
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,759
some points uh because the topic today

319
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:50,159
is a potential so we are talking about

320
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,959
potential and I will provide some very

321
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,679
brief Keynotes from my perspective and

322
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,198
uh of course my perspective is medicinal

323
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,239
potential uh there's other potential you

324
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:03,439
know that there's recreational and

325
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,039
well-being potential but this is not my

326
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,759
focus so my focus is in the in the upper

327
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:14,159
left part of this slide so we are

328
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:16,680
talking about medicinal potential now so

329
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:21,039
what is medicinal potential so potential

330
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:23,159
could be um figured out looking for

331
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:27,240
Publications and for

332
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:30,919
cannabis um this is um really

333
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,440
unique um there is no other area with

334
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,919
such numbers of

335
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:39,839
Publications and um if you look in the

336
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:43,360
literature you will find um uh nearly in

337
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,959
the meanwhile nearly 30,000 Publications

338
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,919
regarding cannabis and um the the

339
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,119
potential of cannabis seems to be

340
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,639
Universal it seems to be really

341
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,198
Universal every day when I enter my

342
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,560
office in the morning uh I got messages

343
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,479
from new Publications and you will not

344
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:06,799
find a single indication without data

345
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,560
from Cannabis uh or cannabinoids so um

346
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,479
there must be something with cannabis

347
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:16,638
because it is it seems to be Universal

348
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,440
and uh and this also is applicable um to

349
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,519
uh the medicinal uh potential so it's

350
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,199
not only um well-being and

351
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,639
recreational um it's also a huge

352
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:35,078
medicinal potential

353
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:38,120
and um this is quite amazing um however

354
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:42,078
uh if you look what kind of data is

355
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,720
published um you will very rapidly

356
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:49,479
recognize that most uh of the data

357
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:53,000
published is um preliminary data it's

358
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,480
not conclusive it's a it's a data data

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,519
generating

360
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,959
hypothesis so we uh this is uh in this

361
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,759
slide you will see normal the normal

362
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,438
pathway of truck of truck development so

363
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,279
in truck development you have a

364
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,279
discovery phase you have pre-clinical

365
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:14,678
testing you have a early um clinical um

366
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:18,240
evaluation which is Phase One and phase

367
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,280
two and then for getting normally a

368
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,000
medicine on the market you need

369
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,798
so-called pivotal studies which are

370
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,919
conclusive which have a high number of

371
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:31,160
patients which need to meet a certain St

372
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,280
standards and if you look for this

373
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,880
studies you will find very very low

374
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:40,960
numbers and in the end we have only

375
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,400
three approved medicines worldwide with

376
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:49,000
cannabis so what does it mean what does

377
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,720
it mean it means on the one hand um

378
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,440
there might be an omnipotent potential

379
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,919
but this potential is not enough and

380
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,200
this is a very important message for you

381
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,880
we will not stay stay in this situation

382
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,200
forever we will not be able um to

383
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,360
deliver um cannabis to our patients as

384
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,558
magist preparations forever we need

385
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:15,558
approved medicines this is a normal way

386
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:19,359
worldwide agreed how patients will have

387
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:22,000
access to Medicine by approval and this

388
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,119
will not be different for cannabis so we

389
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,599
live in a transition period in the

390
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,639
moment and everybody must be aware of

391
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:32,158
that and I very often talk to people

392
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,679
being not aware of that thinking that

393
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:38,120
this will last forever this will not be

394
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,919
and therefore in the current situation I

395
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,639
would like to summarize there's a huge

396
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,200
medicinal

397
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,520
potential however this potential is

398
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,600
mainly based on preliminary or

399
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,359
non-conclusive data there is little

400
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,000
conclusive data in some

401
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:58,279
indications and the medicinal use is

402
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,440
mainly based on No Label or little off

403
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,839
label use

404
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,519
what we are doing in Germany is No Label

405
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:09,759
use this which is normally an an a Very

406
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:12,079
extraordinary Pathway to the patient as

407
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,200
soon as you will have approved products

408
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,798
doctors need to prescribe them off label

409
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,440
they will be no longer allowed to have

410
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:22,519
this off label and No Label

411
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,440
prescriptions so from my

412
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:29,000
perspective um we need to establish

413
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,080
conclusive evidence and we have have to

414
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,798
work for that and um and we need

415
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,960
approved

416
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,599
medicines and uh this means um in the

417
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,079
future this no and off label use will

418
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,558
never ever

419
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:46,240
tolerate um for for a longer period it's

420
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,279
it's a transition

421
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,880
period and um there are no special

422
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,678
Provisions for

423
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,480
cannabis everything is the same so for

424
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,360
approval of medicines you have to stick

425
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,880
to the rules and have to do your

426
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,000
homework and as soon as um approved

427
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,960
medicines will be available doctors need

428
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,359
to prescribe them off label and this uh

429
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,519
No Label use will no longer tolerate it

430
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,839
this is my

431
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:18,519
anticipation and uh for developing and

432
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:21,759
this is now a good bridge to Marcos uh

433
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:24,038
for developing s this um medicines which

434
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,440
will be approved in future we will not

435
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,960
have THC and

436
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,880
CBD because with products having th H C

437
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,200
and CBD you will have no IP and nobody

438
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,760
will invest a huge amount of money for

439
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,000
clinical um studies with a no IP so we

440
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:46,279
need complex extracts we need other

441
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,759
cannabinoids uh to be specified we need

442
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,279
a proprietary extraction which is not

443
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,679
public otherwise you will not be able to

444
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:58,759
protect your um your investment so

445
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,880
simple CBD and THC products they will

446
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:05,480
not be the future and this is also very

447
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:09,559
very important um message you have to

448
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,240
take home um and therefore um complex

449
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:15,720
proprietary extracts or mixtures of

450
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:19,519
cannabinoids uh or maybe also terpenoids

451
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,360
other um ingredients will be the API in

452
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,599
this case because this could be

453
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,158
protected uh because a

454
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,719
generic is always possible if you label

455
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:33,559
only THC and CBD

456
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,839
um so and this again is also important

457
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:39,519
to get more acceptance from the

458
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:42,119
mainstream medicine and um if this

459
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:46,000
industry is not following the rules and

460
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:48,239
is not doing its homework it will not be

461
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,119
accepted this is

462
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,079
my um my anticipation for the future and

463
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,079
cannabis medicines are on the Move

464
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,079
thanks

465
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,000
uh if you would like if you would like

466
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,158
to get my slides please write me with

you thank you very much Marcos um I

470
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:21,359
think uh there

471
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:24,760
were a very uh a few very controversial

472
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,000
points in this uh short presentation and

473
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:30,919
I promise you we come back to it uh we

474
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,960
still have a little bit time but uh I

extracts and producing extracts please

483

through this um so that you don't have

486
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,679
to take too many pictures the slides are

487
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,639
here just take the QR code uh you can go

488
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,080
back and see all my other presentations

489
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,360
as well uh basically who am I we're

490
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,399
talking about inhalation and we're

491
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:16,599
talking about production uh because

492
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,038
actually I'm just a geek I I'm a German

493
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,918
stereotype I have a PhD in chemistry and

494
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,079
I'm all about product process

495
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:28,600
optimization uh so LinkedIn is up there

496
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:31,119
so if you want to say hi please um

497
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:32,918
flower is King right we can talk about

498
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,918
like the medical world and the oils we

499
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:40,360
want to do and you look at the data in

500
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:43,159
North America flower is where it's at

501
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:45,599
it's either flower direct or pre-roll so

502
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,840
the joint already done for you and

503
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,678
everyone cheats with THC because that's

504
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,879
the number that everyone cares about and

505
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,400
that dictates the world like the minor

506
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,080
cannaboids they are sexy they are

507
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,000
cool but THC is where it's at and

508
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,399
everyone sheets the producer the testing

509
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,839
lab and the suppliers increasing it or

510
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,798
decreasing it increasing increasing

511
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,079
because you want more bank for your buck

512
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:13,000
but and these slides are just there so

513
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:15,439
for you to have pointers to shout at me

514
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,640
I tell you they are wrong uh and then we

515
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,880
talk about other stuff so everyone

516
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,400
cheats on THC and when you actually test

517
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,520
it you see it everyone

518
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,798
inflates so therefore it's like is that

519
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,639
actually true because if you look at the

520
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,839
whole Market yes higher THC higher price

521
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,840
but we did the effort and we looked at

522
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:37,079
it on a per state basis and we did

523
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:39,319
Market segmentation and there and that

524
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,278
was just a summer project by one of my

525
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:46,359
students undergrad students we could

526
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:48,839
show the the relationship disappears so

527
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:51,038
it's not just THC we could only show

528
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,158
like a a market price correlation there

529
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,798
of like 20% so there it must be

530
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,600
something else uh that dictates why

531
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,599
cannabis consumers come back and keep

532
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:06,158
buying cannabis products and

533
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:09,199
so chemistry so it's not just THC there

534
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,320
is an aroma that that drives sales we

535
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,640
found that the bestselling products all

536
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,798
skew sweeter than uh the midmarket

537
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,600
products so this is from a paper from

538
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,960
abstract Tech they're downstairs they do

539
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,158
really cool research and they find more

540
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:31,440
compounds than just cannaboids and tpin

541
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:33,960
uh they find thol inds so Canabis is

542
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,759
cool just look like there's so much more

543
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,960
to discover and and with chemistry you

544
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,919
might get a bit of a business

545
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,399
Advantage um

546
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,679
so when we're talking about Canabis we

547
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:51,000
we test the product and then give it to

548
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:54,960
the patient and the ca patient smokes it

549
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,240
and if you put heat and air at anything

550
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,240
you change it so the compliant test

551
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,798
does us a disservice because we don't

552
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,759
actually know what the patient or the

553
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,480
recreation consumer actually gets so I

554
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,398
have a robot that smokes joints and my

555
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,720
students are always disappointed to find

556
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:15,918
that out because they apply for the cool

557
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,200
job they

558
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,360
anticipate so uh I look at joints and I

559
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,840
want to know how they behave and I will

560
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,719
show you I do not care about THC I don't

561
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,519
care if a politician says that THC or

562
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,798
that cannabis flower is becoming too

563
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,440
potent because I can build you a

564
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:38,679
stronger or a weaker joint just with

565
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,679
chemistry so when you look at a joint

566
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,679
you see uh you find out that the first

567
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,080
few Puffs you take have far less THC

568
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,278
than the uh than the last puffs of the

569
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,759
joint but every consumer will tell you

570
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:51,319
that they love the beginning of the

571
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,119
joint because they actually want the

572
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:57,839
flavor tpin behave the other way around

573
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:59,119
so if you prescribe a joint or smoking

574
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,439
as a

575
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,798
as a medical use you have a real problem

576
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,278
with dosing and we also and that's the

577
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,960
graph on the right side the grind size

578
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:11,960
affects how much THC you inhale you can

579
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,200
get more THC per puff with a finer grind

580
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,558
or more THC for the whole joint with a

581
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,919
csor grind so I can build you a dog

582
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,918
walker or a a sharing joint just with uh

583
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,759
better

584
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,919
architecture and then what we what the

585
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:30,158
US market cares about is infusion you

586
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:34,159
put oil in a joint you get more THC cool

587
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,760
right no um wait sorry the blue graphs

588
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,159
on the side show you that per puff there

589
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:41,599
is no difference between a normal flower

590
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,200
joint and an infused joint you just have

591
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,119
way more Puffs and if you can get

592
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,440
through 160 Puffs and one sitting good

593
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:52,839
on you but I don't think that's many of

594
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,720
us and then but what what is the

595
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,599
difference with an infused joint is you

596
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,319
change the flavor the turpine profile

597
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:02,599
changes because the infused oil brings

598
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,240
flavor with it or aroma so maybe that's

599
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,798
what the consumer is

600
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,038
after but there's always a

601
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:13,278
butt these are the

602
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:17,480
toxicant and your oil infused

603
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,839
joint is maybe not the best thing for a

604
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,558
patient so and then talking about

605
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,959
patients and talking about the

606
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:26,200
understanding a Canabis product like

607
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,319
some cannabis products turn purple and

608
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,798
why is that the case and lucky for you

609
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:32,558
this is the only slide you have to look

610
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,798
at and if you want to learn more I'm

611
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:38,918
giving a chemistry lecture on Monday at

612
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:42,200
the Technical University uh but short to

613
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,278
say if you put cannabis as a medical

614
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,759
product everyone talks about the

615
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:50,159
antioxidant uh potential of that

616
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,599
medication if it's antioxidant it will

617
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,600
change and it does oxidize under light

618
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:57,000
and aerobic conditions in your cannabis

619
00:28:54,599 --> 00:29:00,199
products and it goes Haywire there are

620
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
compounds that we we know are toxic and

621
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,519
then there is a host of things we

622
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,038
haven't even fished out of this uh

623
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:11,000
bathtub of new compounds

624
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,558
so cannabis should have a best before

625
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,200
date and you should maybe look at it

626
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:18,519
what happens after you dispense it or in

627
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,000
that supply chain last talk was about

628
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,960
flying it or driving across the state uh

629
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,919
the continent that might also be a

630
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:31,038
problem okay so just

631
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,960
quickly uh uh it doesn't matter if your

632
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,519
cannabis is great if you can't make

633
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,679
money with it because you won't survive

634
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,519
into the next month and if we look at

635
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,798
the public uh data from cannabis

636
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,079
companies they are pretty bad at

637
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:47,839
producing cannabis at a cost efficient

638
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,960
base like if we compare that to cpg or

639
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,199
farmer what they want to be compared at

640
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,600
they were really bad in their profit

641
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,480
margins so that's the geek in me how do

642
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:01,319
we make this better

643
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,759
um it's a modern industry it's like I

644
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,839
heard like the first industry of the

645
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,879
21st century so like act like it like a

646
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,918
uh a bucket and alcohol is not your best

647
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:15,159
way of extraction so we build an AI to

648
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,799
continuously optimize uh the extraction

649
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:20,440
process and not just have your

650
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:24,240
extraction artist make the best product

651
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:28,640
and also um testing is expensive

652
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,440
but if you take ideas from the covid

653
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,880
crisis batch testing pool testing will

654
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,080
cut your costs down and ensure that your

655
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,278
products go through without failure to

656
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,918
the pro um to the patient and then in

657
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,000
process analytics can you cut down the

658
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,200
produ uh the testing cost to like 30

659
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,599
cents a test so we have a algorithm for

660
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,919
that so there's so much more to discover

661
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:57,119
and I think this what is often just a

662
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,278
fairy dust of cannabis could actually be

663
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,199
a really cool

664
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,319
uh chemistry

665
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,960
product and with that I have a few ideas

666
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:11,519
for research products projects so find

667
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,679
me afterwards and email me and thank you

668
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,679
very

669
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,480
much uh thank you very much Marcus um we

670
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:25,398
have another five minutes uh for

671
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,200
audience questions but uh you see this

672
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:30,678
is a very different approach the cad Ian

673
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,798
approach and the German approach is way

674
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:36,960
different uh the German approach is in

675
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:40,480
my eyes um more

676
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,480
scientific but less fun let me say it

677
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:49,440
like this you know because

678
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:51,639
um in my eyes um medical cannabis is

679
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,798
something you cannot compare to other

680
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:57,918
medicin because the development of its

681
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:01,119
legalization is also the is also a fight

682
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,600
of a lot of single people who became who

683
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:07,439
were criminalized for years and they

684
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:09,319
fought for their butts and I remember

685
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,278
when

686
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:14,158
I uh when I had uh when I wrote about

687
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,919
all those cases in Germany we had a lot

688
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,880
of cases people being jailed in the

689
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,200
early

690
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,880
2000s and we were all afraid all the

691
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,558
people were afraid that if one day

692
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,639
cannabis is going to legalize it's going

693
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,879
to be legalized that they cut it apart

694
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:31,599
and put it in the pill

695
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,278
and this is even if the rest of the

696
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,719
pharmaceutical industry works like this

697
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:39,440
you know I want an except I want to be

698
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,240
an exception of the rule because I

699
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,679
received medical cannabis from my doctor

700
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,679
since 15

701
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:51,440
years and so if our industry puts it

702
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,840
into pieces and offers it to patients

703
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,759
and it's a safe medicine I have no

704
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,638
problem with it but don't force people

705
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:03,319
who don't want it this way but the old

706
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:05,638
way to do it the new way and this is my

707
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,798
this is why I said I appreciate the

708
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:10,199
German approach because it's very

709
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:12,879
scientific but we also need a little

710
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,880
part of the Canadian approach because in

711
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,240
none of those two countries anybody any

712
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,278
patient ever died from

713
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,038
Cannabis so um and my colleagues tried

714
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,038
every single

715
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:30,918
day and uh I always said we need the

716
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,320
mixture the Canadian experts and the

717
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,399
German experts they need to do exchange

718
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:37,918
because in Canada it's in my eyes it's

719
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:40,158
not scientific enough and this is also

720
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,919
why it's uh patients are still

721
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,000
stigmatized like

722
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,960
smokers and in Germany it's very very

723
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,359
scientific and sometimes in my eyes they

724
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,720
overdo it and they just oversee the

725
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:56,079
history the development of medical

726
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,558
cannabis worldwide you can't you can't

727
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,519
steal the butts from the

728
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:04,200
no way sorry for that and now we're open

729
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,730
for questions all right check check

730
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,480
let's hear it for the panel one

731
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:12,079
[Applause]

732
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,000
time we have uh maybe one minute and I'm

733
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,079
going to be a little selfish you had

734
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,878
mentioned that you had an AI to do rosin

735
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,079
and resin and things like that uh isn't

736
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:22,719
that what you said to make the

737
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,440
concentrates and things that you were

738
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,719
developing an AI and it seems weird

739
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,200
because I wouldn't want a computer

740
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,199
making my beer

741
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,800
so it's a it's a self enforcing basan

742
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,800
algorithm uh based on random Forest

743
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,440
optimization sure um yeah that was was

744
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,879
that English or

745
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,280
German neither so no the the the the

746
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,918
idea is that if you do an extraction or

747
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,679
you make a Rasin you then judge it and

748
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,279
think it's better or worse and then you

749
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,838
change a parameter and then you do it

750
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,760
again but you can do that with three

751
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,078
four parameters with a computer you can

752
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,520
do that with thousands and you can do

753
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,599
that with thousands of runs and you can

754
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:07,159
learn from other people so if you throw

755
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:10,320
everything together it's basically just

756
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:13,118
you thinking about the problem for years

757
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,079
compressed into seconds so it's it's not

758
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,880
it's not um taking you out of the loop

759
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,160
it's just speeding up your thought

760
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,000
process is

761
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:27,159
it yes yes trust computers to think for

762
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,599
you I mean this is maybe Beyond cannabis

763
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,838
because we're we're getting into an age

764
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:31,640
of where computers are going to try to

765
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,000
do every little freaking thing for us

766
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,920
they're taking jobs from writers and and

767
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,119
all this other stuff and and artists and

768
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,720
people want to write scripts with

769
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,920
computer so it's it's Way Beyond just

770
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,239
cannabis but I think like like to

771
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,599
Michael's point and maybe we're just old

772
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:47,279
dreadlock hippies but there's still

773
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,119
magic in the plant and it can't always

774
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,200
just be science and these are the

775
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,000
challenges that we're

776
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,118
having yeah okay well then we're agreed

777
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,639
let's hear it for the panel it's

778
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,640
fantastic thank you so very much

779
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,960
fantastic
