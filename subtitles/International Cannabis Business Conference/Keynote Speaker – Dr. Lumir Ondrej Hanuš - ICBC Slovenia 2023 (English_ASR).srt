1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,960
uh and now to deliver our our keynote

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,000
speech are you ready

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,219
I know you just sat down but now you

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,320
have to get back up again uh the chief

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,599
scientist for Lumiere lab and asano bio

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,339
group uh the keynote speaker please put

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,899
your hands together and welcome Dr

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:20,899
Lumiere hanush

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,359
[Applause]

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,018
[Music]

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,018
good morning

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,719
my name is

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,200
cannabis from 1970.

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,600
I work 20 years at the Medical Faculty

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,579
of Pulaski University in all about

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,539
Czechoslovakia

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:55,579
all the time in hospital we treated

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,739
patients with cannabis it was from 1955

19
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:01,378
to 1990.

20
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:04,558
and the Dr 1990 Professor meshulam

21
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:08,640
invited me for one year to Jerusalem for

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:12,319
research it's 33 years ago it will be in

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,478
several days exactly 33 days and

24
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,219
it was more or less successful and so I

25
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,118
stayed in adelier

26
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,739
and it's 33 years but during that time I

27
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,900
also

28
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,219
was several times at National Institute

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,219
of Health

30
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:35,280
in Bethesda Maryland

31
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:38,039
and I was an niddk it was a kidney yes

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,719
and there is a Russian ni Triple A

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,079
National Institute of alcohol abuse and

34
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,959
alcoholism and over there I did a

35
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,298
research of hibernation

36
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,519
overground scores

37
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,479
and uh

38
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,280
we studied

39
00:01:53,478 --> 00:02:00,000
concentrations of endocannabinoids

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,640
during hibernation of this grounds War

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,019
because as you can see later

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,818
it's very important for certain human

43
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:11,719
problems which can be

44
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,878
treated because they are influenced by

45
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,739
endocannabinoids and if they are

46
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,378
influenced by endocannabinoids it means

47
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,340
that they will be also influenced by

48
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:22,340
cannabinoids

49
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,818
yeah

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,539
you know concerning sleeping it can be

51
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:33,119
estivated estivation during summer that

52
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,039
animals won't protect

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,099
from dry season

54
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,939
but we talk about hibernation it's more

55
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:43,619
interesting because it's in the winter

56
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,979
when it's short day

57
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,879
it's low temperatures and is not enough

58
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,780
food

59
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:55,439
so animals enter a stage with they

60
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,680
called hibernation and also it's a lot

61
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,620
dark and it's quiet because the nature

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,340
is quiet and it's very important for

63
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,340
hibernation

64
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:11,099
concerning hibernation so through

65
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,098
hibernators

66
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,158
[Music]

67
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:20,579
Grand scores hedgeworks and other

68
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:23,639
animals and

69
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,019
they enter this stage because is not

70
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,399
enough food

71
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:32,939
so during summer they eat a lot of food

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,379
to be fatty and this fed later during

73
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:40,500
hibernation they use like source of food

74
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:41,759
for their body and at the same time it's

75
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,080
also

76
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:49,378
protection is fed against a coward when

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,680
they hibernate from time to time they

78
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:55,378
awake just to check themselves if there

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,379
are not some parasites sometimes they

80
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:02,219
won't eliminate some waste from the body

81
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:05,699
and sometimes they won't eat like you

82
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,859
know the squirrels they collect

83
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,699
food for winter

84
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,700
so

85
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:20,219
also very interesting is Black Bear in

86
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:22,500
America it's not the exact hibernator

87
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,440
because drop

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,040
of temperature is about only between

89
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:32,100
five and six degrees but this

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,879
Bears they sleep

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,759
almost six months and

92
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:42,000
during

93
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:46,080
this what is surprising that there is no

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,459
increase of porosity of their bones and

95
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,459
also they don't use

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,660
any water and they don't have any kidney

97
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,720
problems because

98
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,780
urea when accumulates so it can be toxic

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,419
but they can

100
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:09,359
work up it to other compounds used to

101
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:14,159
nitrogen for proteins and so on

102
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,040
so scientists studied such Bears is

103
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,500
complicated because when they sleep they

104
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,060
can awake when you touch them so

105
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,259
it's special method how to prepare them

106
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:30,538
and uh

107
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:33,919
and they found that this this Bears can

108
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:37,379
survive without any problem and it can

109
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:41,038
help if it solves this problem how they

110
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:45,300
do it help to people which has chronic

111
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:50,038
kidney failure so they can be treated

112
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,560
and they check also bonus TBR its lower

113
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:57,120
part of of the lake

114
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,660
bound and they saw that nine months over

115
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,780
the grizzly and six six months later

116
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,600
there was no increase in porosity

117
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,638
so

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,939
hibernation protect them because all

119
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,259
metabolic processes goes down

120
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:18,779
up to 1998 percent

121
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:23,759
concerning these bonds so

122
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:26,279
it's about 19 years ago

123
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,860
they brought me bones

124
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:34,739
from mice and wanted this was tibia

125
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,819
this is the bond which they use from

126
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,538
theirs to check porosity and femur and

127
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,199
they told me check if there are some

128
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:46,379
noise

129
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,680
so I analyze it and I found that there

130
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,560
is a very small Peak as you can see

131
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,300
almost invisible

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,899
it's in green

133
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,439
so I analyzed this peak and

134
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:04,099
we have Spectrum just to

135
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:08,879
it didn't run in

136
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:12,060
GC so we preparation derivative

137
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,300
and it run very nice and we found that

138
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,079
this is simulated to AG two arachidan

139
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,538
oil glycerol this was second

140
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,758
endocannabinoid which was discovered

141
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:27,079
this isolated

142
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,080
Professor Shimon Ben Shabbat

143
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:34,339
laboratory I also participated but I did

144
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,740
binding studies because at that time Dr

145
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:40,079
Bill Devane already wasn't over there

146
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,598
so he teach me how to do it so I did

147
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:46,229
binding studies

148
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,598
and that to AG stimulates

149
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,660
[Music]

150
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:55,879
bones to be stronger it was proved and

151
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,880
there is also patterned from

152
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:06,479
that when they used to AG

153
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:09,900
with animals so as you can see Romans

154
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:12,959
were stronger there was less porosity so

155
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:16,679
this is very important to agendo

156
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:19,019
cannabinoid which can protect not only

157
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,300
animals but also

158
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:25,279
it must be vodka but also it will be

159
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,280
very useful for human being

160
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,680
you know

161
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,019
concerning bones because there are a

162
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,538
osteoclast and osteoblasts these are

163
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,778
cells which

164
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:43,098
decompose bones and

165
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:48,120
below the bones so this we call

166
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:50,700
this we call bone remodeling and it it

167
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,000
goes all the time so bones which you

168
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,800
have before are not the same bones you

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,419
have just all new

170
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,419
or newborn cells

171
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:08,100
and this endocannabinoids this already

172
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,800
know everybody that CB1 is in a

173
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,519
reproductive system and brain and in

174
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,859
Bones uh CB2 because it's an immune

175
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,980
system

176
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,800
and back to the

177
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,778
hibernating animals what is very

178
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,958
interesting that

179
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:30,838
they drop breath if they breath

180
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:34,559
200 times per minute it drops 100 times

181
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:38,700
to two two breast per minute and hard B

182
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,579
from 200 it drops just only two beats

183
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,040
per minute

184
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,720
so it's important that the hero is

185
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,360
hypothermia

186
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,200
temperature goes really

187
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,600
strongly down and it protects and also

188
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,019
all metabolic processes goes up to 90

189
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,139
and 8 percent down

190
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:04,139
as you can see marmots this is probably

191
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,240
also here in the mountains in Slovenia I

192
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,019
think at least in Slovakia we can see

193
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,419
them

194
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:13,320
so they the temperature of the body

195
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:16,319
drops from 31 to only five point seats

196
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,580
and respiration what I said respiration

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,940
drops down 25 times and heartbeat drops

198
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,580
down 25 times and also brain activity

199
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,459
bronze

200
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:32,580
drops down about 90 percent but the

201
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:34,919
world champion between hibernators are

202
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,139
Arctic Grand scores

203
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,919
temperature of the body it's

204
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:47,159
unbelievable decrease from 37 to minus

205
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:49,860
3.1 minus 3.1 is like frozen meat yes

206
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:52,458
but nothing happened they survive

207
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,959
without any problem

208
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:57,838
and uh

209
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:02,518
after hibernation State they are again

210
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:06,180
okay and solve all this

211
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:09,899
secrets of hibernation can help solve

212
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:12,179
some life threatening situations that

213
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,559
the human being but

214
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,559
[Music]

215
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,199
to understand hibernation they can they

216
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:23,219
hibernate six months but it's impossible

217
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,640
six months because they can die so each

218
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,519
two weeks temperature goes up it's

219
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,379
extreme energy and as they stay about

220
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,500
one day

221
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,899
on the top and then they again hibernate

222
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,000
and during this one day they check if

223
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,519
they don't have parasites eventually

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,419
they eat or they eliminate waste from

225
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,879
the body and it's repeated regularly up

226
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,659
to the end of hibernation and you see

227
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:56,220
down these dots this is temperature

228
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:59,159
temperature of the soil so if they stay

229
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,600
somewhere so they are sleeping in the

230
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:06,480
fact at -10

231
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,899
anything so they can survive so this is

232
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,560
one day when temperature goes up and

233
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:18,600
against down and this sagaround squalls

234
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:21,319
what we studied this uh again

235
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,320
animals which can

236
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,440
hibernate about half a year

237
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:33,360
and during hibernation again goes down

238
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:37,620
as her deed as a frequency of breath and

239
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,879
metabolic rate also decrease and

240
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,159
covered and dark in everything together

241
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,740
help them survive

242
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,899
you know and

243
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,659
these these pictures these are these 13

244
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:55,259
ground scores

245
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:58,860
and this is like human in the fact when

246
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:02,220
we look on the situation which is in the

247
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,220
body of this world it's like human which

248
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,820
suffer a stroke

249
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:13,339
but they have no problem and what they

250
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:17,540
found that blood doesn't clot

251
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:20,760
that there is a rich of ascorbic acid

252
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:24,000
blood what can be interesting for for

253
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:27,659
human being and

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,659
and other

255
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:33,419
white cells are going to hide in for

256
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:37,200
that time so it everything helps them

257
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:38,759
survive code and if a human could have a

258
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,180
hibernate

259
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,819
so body temperature should drop to 5

260
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,958
degrees as you can see heard me three

261
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,600
per minute

262
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,000
and breath in one per four minutes

263
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,980
so it's impossible but we can

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,899
learn it and use it by different way to

265
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,839
help human beings

266
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,759
now concerning our study at National

267
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,360
Institute of Health

268
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:11,759
we studied brain parts of hibernating

269
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,940
non-harby hibernating and regular

270
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,958
squares non-harbenating this was at 4

271
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,660
degrees Centigrades

272
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:24,299
room temperature they are very very wild

273
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:27,600
so we need special gloves because they

274
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:33,139
can bite you but as soon as

275
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,959
they are and we studied several

276
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:38,959
endogenous compounds

277
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:43,638
anandamide

278
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:45,919
2 AG olamide olive oil

279
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,600
this

280
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:53,698
was like standard

281
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:56,879
and when hibernate this ground squirrel

282
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:59,578
because it's cold four degrees so they

283
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:03,600
are like from a refrigerator

284
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:07,198
so they are like ball and when you catch

285
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,199
them they cannot protect themselves so

286
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,778
sometimes happen that some wild animals

287
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:16,198
find them underground and eat them

288
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:19,799
because they cannot protect themselves

289
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:23,219
if I keep it one hour in my hand and

290
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:26,339
opens slowly one eye and it takes about

291
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,500
three hours to be okay

292
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,519
[Music]

293
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,940
so we studied several part of brains

294
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:40,198
this was especially

295
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:43,160
Professor parkovich from Hungary which

296
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:46,559
separated for us this part of brains

297
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:51,299
every time on the spot in

298
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:54,719
in at NIH and this was cerebellum limbic

299
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:57,778
for the brain amygdala hippocampus and

300
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,079
hippo thalamus

301
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:02,639
and to the results the most interesting

302
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,519
was 2ag

303
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,480
this looks that this is very important

304
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,440
endocrabinoid

305
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,639
and uh

306
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,880
as you can see RT is room temperature

307
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:22,198
for this is four degrees

308
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:25,799
and HIV is hibernating

309
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:28,799
they were engaged at four degrees but

310
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,240
not all start to hibernate some of the

311
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,439
them

312
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,379
stay

313
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,220
regularly but at four degrees

314
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,838
but this even Discord

315
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,879
influence amounts of their

316
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,860
endocannabinoids

317
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,120
as you can see

318
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,519
2ag in comparison with room temperature

319
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,980
and this 4 degrees

320
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,320
I shall talk about like four degrees it

321
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,600
means which referred for the the

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,879
temperature 4 degrees it was

323
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,959
significantly different in cerebellum

324
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:07,019
a similar

325
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,720
it was also in limbic for a for a brain

326
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:13,379
it was not like cerebrum but still it

327
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:17,600
was significant for three stars limbic

328
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:22,679
foreign and then we studied also

329
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,879
2ag in amigdala in amigdala still you

330
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,000
can see

331
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,220
that significantly higher concentrations

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,380
of 2he

333
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,380
the better at hibernating scores

334
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:42,319
from other compounds we studied

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,298
epilolamide in cerebellum you can see

336
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:48,899
that it

337
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:52,079
scores at four degrees and hibernating

338
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:56,038
it increased significantly in comparison

339
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:58,759
with room temperature and the last

340
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:01,558
compound

341
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:04,079
which we studied the number of

342
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,839
differences but I'm talking about this

343
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,779
whichever the most significant and

344
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:12,538
olamide this is called sometimes

345
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:17,099
sleeping factor in limbic for a brain

346
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:21,298
you can see that increased significantly

347
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:23,959
when labor at 4 degrees and also at the

348
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:23,960
hibernating

349
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,900
and we studied also olamide in the all

350
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,799
compounds but polyamide in plasma was

351
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,919
the most

352
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,918
important and in comparison of this

353
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,299
regular squash at room temperature you

354
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,559
can see that

355
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:45,179
this only am I think the significantly

356
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,639
increased so probably

357
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,860
these are the most important and the

358
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,220
cannabinoids which

359
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:57,298
protect these other protection factors

360
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,079
of course this ground scores

361
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:00,079
survive

362
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,360
our interest was also concerning some

363
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,519
compound which we would like to call

364
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:13,279
hibernator

365
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,279
so we try to find which compound

366
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,160
has rise changes and this is part of

367
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:22,798
part of chromatogram and we founded this

368
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,820
compound which is in blue

369
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:30,900
that significantly decrease so we try to

370
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:33,918
identify this compound and on the left

371
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,240
is NOLA in itra this is one of

372
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,259
endocannabinoids which we isolated at

373
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,838
Hebrew University

374
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:42,838
[Music]

375
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,980
there is one double boneless

376
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,558
otherwise it's the same as noladin ether

377
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,660
unfortunately

378
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,918
didn't have somebody who can synthesize

379
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,100
this for us

380
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,759
to to prove that it fits 100 percent

381
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:05,759
because only analysis and Spectra it's

382
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:09,500
nice but we like every time prove it

383
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,500
with a real compound

384
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:16,439
so what

385
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,600
is the result from this our studies you

386
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,980
know if we understand molecular

387
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,339
mechanism

388
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,120
of a bone Mars main financing beers so

389
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:29,099
it can be it can lead to prevent

390
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:32,279
osteoporosis at chronically hospitalized

391
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:37,199
patients because they stay in the bed so

392
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,200
that it goes very fast osteoporosis

393
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,839
formation that

394
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,200
just kidney

395
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:50,399
drops urine in kidney drops by 95

396
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,740
percent so it can be very important to

397
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
treat people suffering from chronic

398
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,720
kidney failure

399
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,240
and understanding how body temperatures

400
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,860
are tolerated by squares

401
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:08,099
May facilitate that organs for

402
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:11,099
transplantation we can store more time

403
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:16,019
because sometimes for long distance so

404
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:20,219
it's a long time so it can be

405
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:23,279
safer and molecular mechanism of

406
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:27,720
Tolerance of blood flow because its

407
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:29,759
blood flow is very low so it can also

408
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,058
give us a hints

409
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,279
for treatment of ischemia

410
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,740
and then

411
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:41,038
during

412
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:45,980
hibernation blood flow as I said drops

413
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:49,740
down up to 98 percent for several weeks

414
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,179
and identification of this molecular

415
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,058
mechanism

416
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:58,200
can again help us protect from injury

417
00:21:54,058 --> 00:22:02,240
due to stroke or heart attack so these

418
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,240
are very important thing and

419
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,179
I would like to tell you it will be at

420
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,519
the end but I want it there now so

421
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:17,280
Extreme Survival this arteries of

422
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:21,418
hibernation of animals and occasionally

423
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:23,940
human as I show you directly and

424
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:26,900
it can overcome life's threatening

425
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,900
injuries

426
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:35,038
that human body also can fight against

427
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:37,740
cold like animals I show you three

428
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,298
unbelievable examples there is more but

429
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,980
I choose three

430
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:44,639
in Norway

431
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,279
one radiologist she did cross-country

432
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,360
with friends and the neighbor across in

433
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,099
the river

434
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:54,538
so

435
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:58,379
breaks ice and she fall exactly was as

436
00:22:54,538 --> 00:23:02,819
you can see they couldn't take her up

437
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:06,539
because also they can be under eyes so

438
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:09,178
she found her some air bubble and was

439
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:12,240
fighting for minutes for life

440
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:14,820
then she finished and she was more than

441
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,579
ever in this icy water

442
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:20,759
no breasts no heartbeat

443
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:23,480
more than our and her body temperature

444
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,720
that they brought you was only

445
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,720
13.7 degrees

446
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,700
he survived

447
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,179
they treated her

448
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:40,319
and they hit slowly blood

449
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:42,419
outside they took it outside and back

450
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,058
and she survived

451
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,740
in Canada

452
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:51,319
at two at night

453
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,700
I work as small smaller girl and

454
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:56,579
accidentally she opened door and went

455
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,880
outside to snow there was minus 20

456
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:03,058
degrees parents found her and she was

457
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,980
more than our already without breasts

458
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:08,940
without

459
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:12,720
a heartbeat and had 21 degrees they took

460
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:16,798
her to hospital and the next day

461
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,200
they treated her next day she was okay

462
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,519
and this is very interesting this

463
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,980
hibernating man one man went from France

464
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,879
from region where are usually are not

465
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,380
people

466
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,159
he fall and broke his Paris

467
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:38,460
and he couldn't move so stayed one day

468
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:42,000
and then he lost Consciousness and they

469
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,940
found him after 24 days there was

470
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,599
temperature 10 degrees

471
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:53,700
he was without food without water had no

472
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:56,819
pass almost organs at all almost shut

473
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,558
down and body temperature was only 23

474
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:01,619
degrees

475
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,940
they took him to hospital he survived

476
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:09,239
without any problems after that

477
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,019
so human body has possibilities but we

478
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,720
must

479
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:15,359
find we must study it and find these

480
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:21,779
possibilities concerning hibernation

481
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:24,859
what really can help in treatment and

482
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:29,220
Professor meshulam which unfortunately

483
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:33,418
this is ingenuary we celebrated his 92

484
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:39,120
and he was perfect then

485
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:42,659
he became Chicken in six weeks he died

486
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,778
so he said that there is almost

487
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:48,620
any physiological process which

488
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:51,359
is influence in the body by

489
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:54,538
endocannabinoids and he said that

490
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:58,139
whatever THC doesn't understand also so

491
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:59,419
I can only add that cannabinoids can do

492
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,220
whatever

493
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,759
endocannabinoids do and in the

494
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,798
cannabinois they mimic

495
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:10,200
endocannabinoids so if we can see that

496
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:12,859
during this hibernation

497
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,460
uh

498
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:21,119
examples of lice threatening situations

499
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:24,480
which can be treated humans that we

500
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:28,379
should study it I know only another one

501
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,679
publication appeared after us we studied

502
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,440
this endocannabinois uh grandson in

503
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,120
hibernation so it cannot really help

504
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,320
humans

505
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:44,178
to treat this serious problems

506
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,178
thank you very much for your attention

507
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,519
Dr Harris

508
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:52,979
we may have time for a few questions

509
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,159
does anybody have a question there's a

510
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,200
question right here here yeah

511
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,360
hello Roman from The Faculty of Health

512
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,038
Sciences I would just like to maybe if

513
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,778
you give us a follow-up you show them

514
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:06,419
that you found the molecule which is

515
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:08,220
responsible for hibernating and you said

516
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,980
that nobody isolated do you have any

517
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,460
follow-up any progress on that specific

518
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,380
molecule

519
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,579
I don't have progress because when I

520
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,580
finish at NIH

521
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,918
so we didn't have anybody to synthesize

522
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,100
it so I

523
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,940
and I was forced to return because we

524
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:37,139
had a project in Jerusalem so I couldn't

525
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:40,919
stay longer I returned again for months

526
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:44,038
and we studied it so we came to decision

527
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:45,059
that this is the compound which I showed

528
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,400
you

529
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:48,658
so

530
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,120
we have to look into it if somebody else

531
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:53,700
did it then something okay thank you

532
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,579
it's still opened

533
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,960
but probably it's this compounding so it

534
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:01,199
will be probably

535
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,440
also endocalabinoid

536
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,700
are there more questions oh over here

537
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,700
I'm closer so

538
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,640
It's a Wonderful presentation do you

539
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:17,459
have any idea or hypothesis of what the

540
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,380
Ananda mind does what is its function in

541
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,980
the hibernation because it was so much

542
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,980
increased

543
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:29,480
is very interesting compound

544
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,700
it's not the best compound from

545
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,579
endocannabinoids I isolated even more

546
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,558
active compound but because anandamide

547
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:40,500
was the first one

548
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:43,558
so it's such studied you know this is

549
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,960
like active was THC so everybody studied

550
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:47,879
the AC and here was

551
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,200
an undermine so everybody studied

552
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,799
anandramide and then they studied 2ag

553
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,360
y2hd and not docosa

554
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:01,679
retinolamide which isolated and which

555
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:05,639
was more active because 2ag is different

556
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,759
chemistry because one time it's am I the

557
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,380
one time it's Easter so that is why they

558
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,319
wanted to study

559
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,419
different chemical nature of the

560
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:19,798
compound that is why these two compounds

561
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:23,659
are mostly studied and we saw that the

562
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:27,058
main function in organism is protect

563
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:29,880
humans from stress

564
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,898
why we name it anandamide there are two

565
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,760
reasons

566
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:38,879
Ananda is bliss Delight and Dr William

567
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:41,339
Devane studied Eastern philosophy and

568
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,020
they found that in sanskrat Ananda is

569
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:47,220
bliss Delight

570
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:49,319
so he wanted to name it anandadin

571
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,419
when you isolated we shall call it

572
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,119
anandarin he said because he was a

573
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,240
specialist in molecular pharmacology and

574
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,839
all my isolates he tested for activity

575
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,240
so we did it together because

576
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:08,278
one without the other one couldn't do it

577
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:11,640
so it was a perfect cooperation and when

578
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:16,339
we identified it professor musulam said

579
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:20,059
ah but chemical nature also and it was

580
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:20,058
ethanol amide

581
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:30,240
[Music]

582
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:34,678
because it should Express happiness of

583
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,798
discoverers and ex expected effect

584
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:41,519
that is in organism

585
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:45,019
compound which makes you happy or which

586
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,019
beats your stress

587
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:53,000
thank you so you're saying that weed

588
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:55,809
makes you happy which is great

589
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,058
are there any more questions

590
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,740
[Applause]

591
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:00,480
over there no one's going to come over

592
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,278
this is this is Noah let's hear it for

593
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,500
Noah everybody he's helping

594
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:08,460
he's got the nice shoes

595
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,099
hello uh fascinating uh presentation so

596
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,259
curious so the final closing statements

597
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:16,139
of endocannabinoids and cannabinoids

598
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:19,140
having a high crossover effect

599
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,480
what is your proposed study how we can

600
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,299
start seeing the effects of the

601
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,860
cannabinoids and

602
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:28,740
endocannabinoid systems since like you

603
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:31,199
said everyone jumped on THC because it

604
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,778
was the first there's so many potential

605
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,519
subcompounds to study what's the

606
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:36,980
framework that you're looking at does

607
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,058
that exist does it need to be done

608
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,019
what's the future look like in this

609
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:43,740
space

610
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:47,460
you know in the fact when I

611
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:50,640
was forced to enter pension because you

612
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,460
can work in Israel only to age 68 so I

613
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,679
work at the University at 69. we are

614
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,720
head of department but I wasn't

615
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,320
you can stay for good

616
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,019
up to death yes so I finished at 69 and

617
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:08,339
I came to to the company

618
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:10,679
which wanted to treat endometriosis with

619
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:14,339
cannabis so we studied endometriosis

620
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,580
it's really very interesting because

621
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:19,798
about between 10 and 11 percent women in

622
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:22,740
productive age

623
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:25,019
has endometriosis some of them don't

624
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,620
know that it's endometriosis because it

625
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:30,379
can take long longer time

626
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:33,239
to find that this disease is

627
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,520
endometriosis and probably I am not

628
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,460
going to talk about that because you

629
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,359
probably know all these signs

630
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,778
from which we understand it so in Israel

631
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:49,398
I know one physician

632
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:51,980
he treated with cannabis several women

633
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:56,459
misendrumentriosis and he was successful

634
00:32:51,980 --> 00:33:00,980
so this is filled which is very

635
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,980
interesting unfortunately this company

636
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:08,278
as we say coronavirus ate ate them

637
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,199
so this laboratory doesn't continue

638
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,940
because they didn't have money because

639
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,840
of Corona

640
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,840
so

641
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,159
this

642
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:23,038
at the moment it's in the eyes it's

643
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,460
waiting to continue then we'll be more

644
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,859
favorable situation they also moved from

645
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,200
here Jerusalem it was very complicated

646
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:32,759
to travel you know travel every day

647
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,058
three hours

648
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:39,538
to the left it's too much so

649
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:42,778
so what happened this happened and the

650
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:46,700
study of cannabinoids of course the most

651
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:50,460
interesting study should be a real

652
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,220
calabinois it means real carabinoids are

653
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,919
acid cannabinoid acids of course

654
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:00,259
and they studied the carboxylase and the

655
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,340
carboxylase of this real seeds are for

656
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:05,179
cannabiserolic cannabis romantic

657
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:09,779
tetrahedral cannabinole cannabidiolic

658
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:12,599
and also cannabis hero

659
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,820
cannabidi or tetrahedral cannabinol and

660
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:19,019
cannabis Roman so these are the main

661
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,919
compounds which are studied because they

662
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:24,019
are in highest concentrations

663
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:29,638
and uh

664
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:32,639
sometime we must find how how to give it

665
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,820
to the patient because

666
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,119
if you imagine that concentrations of

667
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:42,000
anandamide if I knew that I never start

668
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,980
to isolate it the concentrations are

669
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,139
nanograms per gram

670
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,059
what is nothing it was now when I

671
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,838
isolated for the first time and I

672
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:53,940
evaporated it so glass tube was clean

673
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:57,420
that was nothing but I dissolved this

674
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,880
nothing and we build and tested it so it

675
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,280
was active yeah so it's a very low

676
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,800
concentrations and

677
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,720
with our effort at the end we have half

678
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,180
milligram it was enough for

679
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:12,000
identification half milligram it was a

680
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:16,199
huge amount when you imagine so probably

681
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,500
calabino is when they are used so also

682
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,358
very small amounts in the fact are used

683
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,480
by the body

684
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:28,259
all everything is lost because sometimes

685
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:32,400
people use grams of cannabinoisms and so

686
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:35,220
on yes so it's still even when uh now

687
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,338
thousand Publications I cannot check

688
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:41,578
everything before I sense

689
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:43,679
uh snail mail and I had all reference

690
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,320
today it's impossible even though you

691
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:49,319
cannot download all papers every week is

692
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,420
between one and 300 papers on kind of

693
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,838
you know it's an endocannabinoids

694
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,159
so if you rest one month so then you

695
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,099
have

696
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:02,519
almost 2 000 papers sometimes so it

697
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,740
takes me two days I'll just only go go

698
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,179
through these papers and to find what is

699
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:11,000
important

700
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:13,399
so of course it must be studied because

701
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,039
cannabinoids mimic

702
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,920
endocannabinoids and not everybody of us

703
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,480
has

704
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,300
endocannabinoid system enacts enough

705
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:28,760
strong to be diseases

706
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:32,000
somebody has disease but

707
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,260
endocannabinoid system fast returns to

708
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,659
homeostasis and then is balancing

709
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,540
organisms and you are healthy and

710
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:42,779
sometimes organism is in a is not enough

711
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,940
strong so you must use cannabinois to

712
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,920
help to the person

713
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:54,358
so and there is so many diseases

714
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,460
that discuss it is not such easy and why

715
00:36:54,358 --> 00:37:00,179
is so many diseases which can be treated

716
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:02,519
because kind of endocardial system and

717
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:04,980
cannabinoid receptors are one of the

718
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,900
most spread receptors in human body you

719
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,019
can find it almost anywhere that is why

720
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:13,700
it worked with so many diseases

721
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,699
thank you so very much one more time

722
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:21,000

just starting to really understand all

725
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,500
