also from a legal perspective and then

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,060
in the middle we have Nearman Kai has

moment with Kai's support

36
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,259
um and in here we have Dr Cornelius

37

managing directors he's responsible for

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,920
finance and procurement so it's a

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,379
marketing fundraising and has worked

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,159
with the beef RAM and

44
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,978
um

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,159
but now most more recently

46
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,200
um Cornelius also started looking into a

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,159
venture

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,859
Venture funding

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,659
um yeah so let's get started straight

50
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,379
away so

51
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,879
um Kai let's start with you

52
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,219
um

53
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,318
there's this ongoing discussion about

54
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,239
cannabis reform but maybe before we dive

55
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,119
into that let's have a quick look into

56
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,539
the medical area and into CBD what's

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,939
your stance on that

58
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:26,699
you mean we got to the upcoming uh

59
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,719
legalization yes yes okay

60
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,299
yeah

61
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:34,098
um I think we're concentrating on on the

62
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:38,180
CBD side of of things CBD is very very

63
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:41,699
complicated uh right now since the

64
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,319
European Union decided in 2019 to put

65
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:49,560
CBD on the novel food catalog so the

66
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:53,280
member states of the EU decided that CBD

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,560
extracts are noble food and Germany

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,340
enforced this novel fruit directive

69
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,459
since 2019 very slowly we had the hype

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:08,280
in 2019 2020-21 and then

71
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:11,400
the law enforcement took place and you

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,620
will hardly find any CBD product CBD oil

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,158
labeled as food or as a food supplement

74
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,459
on the German shelves of the big

75
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:24,318
retailers right now and the last resort

76
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,420
was the Cosmetic oral care product

77
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,639
cosmetricious moonflieger spray the so

78
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:33,479
at first it was labeled as a supplement

79
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:36,119
and the Second Step was Aroma and the

80
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,280
third step was Aroma extract and the

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:45,060
last resort was now the Cosmetic oral

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:47,039
product and last week we got a a ruling

83
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,098
from the administrative Court of

84
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,699
digitaldorf saying that the ban of this

85
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:55,378
product was illegal so and if this the

86
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,560
court in Dusseldorf was referring to the

87
00:03:55,378 --> 00:04:00,719
court in Hamburg which also said that

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,780
the ban of this product the distribution

89
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,539
band was illegal and now we have the

90
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,180
situation that you can trade CBD oils in

91
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,938
Hamburg and Dusseldorf but not in Berlin

92
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,819
and not in the south of Germany this is

93
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:18,298
due to the structure of the health

94
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,839
authority oversight in in Germany which

95
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,000
makes it also very very complicated and

96
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,159
I don't see any solution of that so you

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,579
have with these with these ruling you

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,439
have two to three years time to the main

99
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:35,939
proceedings and probably by that the

100
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,699
applications of Iha and the different

101
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:41,219
other players at the EU commission for

102
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,759
authorizing CBD extract as a novel food

103
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,800
will take place so it's due to the

104
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,400
legalization efforts it's still very

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,500
hard to sell the CBD and the the CBD

106
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,179
Market is is very very complicated and

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,620
it doesn't make any difference if you if

108
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,199
you look at the legislation which is

109
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,160
coming up that's why I started with this

110
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,520
question

111
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,439
um so maybe to uh to show you also that

112
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,120
we have an existing Market where we are

113
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,259
still facing a lot of challenges here in

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,759
Germany

115
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,500
um that are independent of all these

116
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,600
legalization efforts that are currently

117
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,300
talked about but maybe Peter could you

118
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,120
explain what is the Envision to pillar

119
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,978
model that we see and what are the two

120
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,379
pillars and what they determine

121
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,418
government proposed for that

122
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,459
yeah thank you very much Lisa for the

123
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:29,099
kind introduction I think everybody in

124
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,560
this room expected some good news from

125
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,759
Germany moving into recreational

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,319
I'm afraid we don't have these good news

127
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:43,020
let's look into what has happened since

128
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:47,159
2022 as you may have followed the German

129
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,978
government in 2022 in October 2022

130
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,919
released a position paper in which they

131
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:54,538
clearly outlined in which way

132
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,399
legalization of recreational cannabis

133
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:57,779
and let's call it recreational cannabis

134
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,418
for adult use and you just say

135
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:03,079
recreational cannabis in Germany it was

136
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:07,079
very clearly outlined in which way

137
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,719
Germany would cultivate distribute and

138
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,659
of course even control the use of

139
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,240
cannabis under the government control

140
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,820
that was the plan

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,120
the government noticed that this may in

142
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,038
conflict with certain laws in particular

143
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,459
with the Schengen agreement which is the

144
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,680
basis of the European Union

145
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:31,019
and actually

146
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,360
forwarded this pilot paper together with

147
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,519
an explanation and its arguments why

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,560
they actually turned around from a

149
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,418
Prohibition policy to a legalization

150
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:45,538
policy to the European commission

151
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:48,060
expecting that they at least not agree

152
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,959
but I would say not it's not a formal

153
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,538
process

154
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,638
so the European commission looked at the

155
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:55,560
paper and at the arguments and the

156
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,300
arguments were very much the same as

157
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,339
Canada has used them for the

158
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,079
legalization of recreational Cannabis as

159
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:06,060
well which is uh better control of the

160
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,680
distribution of the cannabis for

161
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,199
recreational purposes to protect the

162
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,139
youth uh better control for the

163
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,800
consumers to get high quality products

164
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,660
to the respective user and of course to

165
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,220
attack the illicit Market the same

166
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,860
arguments have been used here well the

167
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,259
European commission said actually no

168
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,840
this is going to violate the Schengen

169
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,360
agreement if you implement that in

170
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,918
Germany we are going to initiate the

171
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,598
respective proceedings before the

172
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,698
European court of justice for breach of

173
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,098
contract of the sharing agreement so

174
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,960
Germany turned around and now here comes

175
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:45,538
the two new pillar pro project

176
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,959
it was released in April the two pillars

177
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:51,560
are as follows pillar number one

178
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:55,258
Germany is going to allow

179
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,439
the home grow of up to three female

180
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,560
plants for every every adult

181
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,339
number one number two Germany is going

182
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,139
to allow the establishment of cannabis

183
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,179
clubs I would call it cultivation

184
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,598
associations because that's what it

185
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,418
really is uh each Club each Association

186
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:17,339
can have up to 500 members and can grow

187
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,620
cannabis for their members for

188
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,659
recreational purposes under very strict

189
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,899
control

190
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:28,319
number three of that our first pillar is

191
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:30,000
that cannabis and THC related products

192
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,278
will be taken out of the German

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,559
narcotics act and will be actually

194
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:38,158
transferred to that new cannabis act

195
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,699
with some impact also on the medical

196
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,278
Market which we may discuss in a minute

197
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,240
this is pillar number one

198
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:50,539
a respective law has been leaked

199
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,879
a draft law has been leaked it's not yet

200
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:56,759
released artificially or we have had a

201
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,860
look at that and of course there are a

202
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,039
number of questions with regard to the

203
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,639
implementation of how is this actually

204
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:08,159
working how does the Cannabis

205
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:11,819
cultivation Association really be

206
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:14,338
controlled who is going to decide where

207
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,519
and what is going to be cultivated so

208
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,260
how it's financed because it's a

209
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,839
non-profit organization and I think

210
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,819
that's important to know it should be a

211
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,620
non-profit organization so for every

212
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,480
every investor in this room this is bad

213
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,720
news actually actually because they

214
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,180
should not make any money so this is the

215
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,920
first pillar let me just introduce the

216
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,539
second pillar if you allow these are the

217
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:42,240
second pillar is that Germany will start

218
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:44,699
pilot scientific pilot projects which

219
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,519
are as we all know allowed under the U.N

220
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,100
conventions and the sharing agreement

221
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,500
under specific scientific control where

222
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,839
distribution will be done through

223
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:00,179
properly licensed shops or licensed

224
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:04,080
Distributors uh to those who have been

225
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:07,319
resisted and are going to use cannabis

226
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,139
for the recreational purposes this is

227
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,240
not yet even a draft law it's just a

228
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,819
plan probably the draft law will be

229
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,820
released after the summer break later

230
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,620
this year with regard to the cannabis

231
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,360
clubs or the calabas cultivation

232
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,560
associations just two more effects

233
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:30,240
number one there will be a limit of 30

234
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:33,239
grams per month for adults of up to 21.

235
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,480
so between 18 and 21 we have the

236
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,720
possibility to get 30 grams at a THC

237
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,180
level of 10 or below

238
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,360
oops

239
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:50,399
number two adults can actually purchase

240
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:53,940
50 grams with no THC limits from those

241
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,639
cannabis as cultivation associations so

242
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,680
that's what the laws current draft law

243
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,539
says whether it will be implemented in

244
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,578
such way is of course questionable it's

245
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,139
now discussed between the Ministries and

246
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,059
will be actually forwarded to the

247
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:09,419
cabinet probably not before the summer

248
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:13,879
break which starts in 14 days

249
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:17,699
thank you so Cornelius as a one or us

250
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:20,639
the only true German cultivator in

251
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,100
Germany what is your stance on the

252
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,980
current status of the industry and what

253
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,620
are you looking for in the future

254
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,899
good morning hello

255
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,379
good morning everybody

256
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,379
um so

257
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,120
let's try it here good morning everybody

258
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:42,000
it's a pleasure to be here to see you

259
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,139
all and thank you for having us on this

260
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,200
panel

261
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,240
um I I'd like to start with um telling

262
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,240
you a little bit about our story and I

263
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,278
think the biggest challenges we faced in

264
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,079
the germ market and then go to the

265
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,419
evolution and uh

266
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,458
forecast of what the German Market could

267
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:03,078
look like so I think the biggest

268
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:06,239
milestone in Germany we saw in the past

269
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:09,899
five years was the building of a

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,180
national the domestic supply chain so

271
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,220
there were three licenses tended out in

272
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,019
2018

273
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,420
for cultivation of cannabis in Germany

274
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:22,560
and the idea was to have an entire

275
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:24,479
domestic supply chain and as an operator

276
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,979
in the space as a cultivator as an

277
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,839
importer as a Processing Company demican

278
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,839
we really saw this as a big Challenge

279
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,779
and we were very happy to be able to

280
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,459
start delivering last year

281
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,200
now

282
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,359
um domestic supply chain I think it's

283
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,500
important to stretch this one because in

284
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,620
the

285
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,820
um forecasted recreational Cannabis

286
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,480
space

287
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,360
it looks like in the draft law that all

288
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,839
cannabis needs to be produced in Germany

289
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,539
processed in Germany and we will have to

290
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,480
have a complete domestic supply chain

291
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:06,299
also in the recreational space and I

292
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,000
know many companies who started as

293
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,799
importers

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,100
they don't like it because they will

295
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,919
have to Pivot their business model to

296
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:21,000
either build their own cultivation space

297
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:24,240
or rent or purchase production

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,539
capacities at existing production sites

299
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,220
such as damikan or Aurora or Toure

300
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,578
whether they want to

301
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,160
so um I think yeah domestic supply chain

302
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,799
was the biggest challenge and now we

303
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,179
have it I think there's a fair chance

304
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,439
for

305
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:46,399
um the German Market to be able to live

306
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,079
up to what we have to which is to supply

307
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,120
the German Market if we look at

308
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,399
forecasts for the addressable Market in

309
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,100
the recreational space it's about 400

310
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,919
tons to be conservative of those 400

311
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,778
tons how much we will see in a cannabis

312
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:03,120
Social Club scenario which is pillow one

313
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:07,740
that Peter just introduced maybe 10

314
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,778
which is 40 tons 40 tons then we can we

315
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,860
could deliver half of that 20 tons

316
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:16,259
easily on our production Side by scaling

317
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,399
up and that within the first year of

318
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:22,500
delivery so when you hear people say oh

319
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,559
we have to import because we have to be

320
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,600
able to supply the demand yeah we don't

321
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,479
have to we can't produce it in Germany

322
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,639
and there are also other Market players

323
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,379
I look at York here in the first row

324
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,778
who's building a production site so

325
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,019
there is initiative there is

326
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:42,539
entrepreneurs starting to to jump into

327
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,179
this Gap and we can do it

328
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,259
now looking at the medical space what

329
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,719
happened

330
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:53,819
um we saw some nice growth I would say

331
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,800
from 2021 to 2022 and 2021 we had nine

332
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,199
tons of medical cannabis being sold in

333
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,659
pharmacies in 2022 we don't have

334
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,698
official numbers but if you extrapolate

335
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:07,019
the official numbers until September

336
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:08,219
2022 we had 11.4 tons that is 26 of

337
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,778
growth

338
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:15,778
um it's a small Medical Market but even

339
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,759
if we don't like the draft law for

340
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,360
recreational Cannabis because it imposes

341
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,879
many challenges for us as operators and

342
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,639
Market players I think there is a chance

343
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:30,120
to actually fight the black market and

344
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,560
grow interesting business models

345
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,560
thank you

346
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,939
so let's jump back over to yukai what do

347
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,278
you think

348
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,740
do you believe there's a possibility to

349
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,078
establish a legal framework from out of

350
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,039
Germany for Europe also

351
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:48,599
no

352
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:51,539
cannabis can't be regulated in the EU

353
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,360
for the as a sense right now if you look

354
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:57,179
at countries like Sweden or Finland or

355
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,778
whatever they have a such a conservative

356
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:03,479
approach to cannabis uh there won't be a

357
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:06,320
unanimous solution in the EU in in terms

358
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,778
of cannabis I don't I don't think so

359
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,139
so what's the option then I had the

360
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:16,078
chance to talk to Czech officials

361
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:19,139
in April and in May and June I was

362
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:22,198
listening to James Rich water check the

363
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,839
federal drug commissioner the ponderf of

364
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,639
pocardinet in in the Czech Republic and

365
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,800
he was saying they are working on a law

366
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,560
in the Czech Republic to legalize

367
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,838
cannabis and to open a commercial route

368
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,399
and they exactly know what's going to

369
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
happen that there might be a problem

370
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,980
with the EU commission with other member

371
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:43,979
states and they faced that they say okay

372
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,959
yeah let's let's get sued let's go to

373
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,300
court let's go let's take it to the ECG

374
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,758
let's see what happens and if the ECG

375
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,859
finally decides after five years we have

376
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,320
our industry established here and the

377
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,720
the industry won't vanish won't

378
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,699
disappear then anymore let's and if they

379
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,680
have some some regulations or some some

380
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:03,958
guidelines we have to obey okay we will

381
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,159
do that but we will work on this

382
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,039
commercial route

383
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,558
and we will we will do it and they have

384
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:13,379
a really interesting uh approach they

385
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:17,480
call it the cyclo psychomodulatory

386
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:21,240
Substances Act so uh psycho modulatory

387
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,699
means this will also cover low THC

388
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,959
products like in Switzerland like up to

389
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:31,019
one percent CBD flowers like Kratom and

390
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,120
it will also cover Kratom and you will

391
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,418
implement the measures of Regulation

392
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,159
according to the dangers to the danger

393
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,960
of the substance so the substance is

394
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,360
really dangerous you will have more

395
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,100
regulation if it is less dangerous you

396
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,619
will have less regulation and I think

397
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,619
this is a very very modern approach to

398
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,079
to cannabis policy in terms of health

399
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:54,058
issues but also in terms of Human Rights

400
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,279
so for freedom of person to use

401
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,859
substances

402
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,558
and this is the only way so small

403
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:04,798
countries like I heard Slovenia has some

404
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:07,019
some initiatives I heard last night the

405
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,660
Czech Republic has to move forward it's

406
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,339
not the big countries showing the EU how

407
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,820
to regulate cannabis it will be the

408
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:19,199
small countries to move forward and find

409
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:23,159
ways to to circumen these uh still stand

410
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,259
in the in the EU and uh in at the latest

411
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,058
point it has to be the courts but but

412
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,879
but not the member states they won't be

413
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:32,038
in unanimous Solutions uh it's single

414
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,919
countries moving forward or at least the

415
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:37,079
ECG has to decide on on that and if you

416
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,179
have facts like you have an established

417
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,639
Market in the Czech Republic after five

418
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:44,640
years you want you can't draw back the

419
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,100
the clocks then anymore

420
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,020
um Peter maybe also for you how do you

421
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,359
think that the Cannabis legalization

422
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:53,579
efforts in Germany will affect existing

423
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,699
Industries but also the illegal market

424
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:59,279
and how will this legal framework also

425
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,620
maybe affect changes in the EU

426
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,019
regulatory framework regarding cannabis

427
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:06,719
yeah let's let's start with the the last

428
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:10,319
part of the three questions

429
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,960
um indeed as as you pointed out Kai

430
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,599
there are a number of member states who

431
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,480
see it positively what the Germans are

432
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,918
doing the approach of October 2022 was

433
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,819
very much supported by the Czech

434
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,440
Republic anyway however

435
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:29,399
there are other member states who are

436
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,500
relatively conservative or to say at

437
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,080
least against the legalization of

438
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,319
recreational cannabis they are also

439
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,178
larger countries uh Germany would not go

440
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,639
the route as you described the further

441
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,740
Czech Republic because Germany lost big

442
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,220
times before the European court of

443
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,099
justice in other subject matters just

444
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,839
recently and as such Germany is not

445
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,899
going to take that route though it's

446
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:57,359
more a cautious approach which they are

447
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,720
taking coming back to your second

448
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,699
question well the actual argument of the

449
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,579
legalization in Germany was to attack

450
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,940
the illicit market and if you look into

451
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:11,939
the first pillar the question is is that

452
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,600
really the right instrument to do it if

453
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,880
you allow a home grow if you allow

454
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,798
cannabis cultivation of course under the

455
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,380
government control but as I said

456
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,960
non-profit it's still economically

457
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,559
questionable whether this will work may

458
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,419
not be a good approach towards the

459
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,819
illicit market and for the protection of

460
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:36,419
the youth I I'm going to question that

461
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:38,339
Frankly Speaking the second pillar with

462
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,320
the regard to the scientific pilot

463
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:42,298
projects which we see in other countries

464
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,339
happening as well in particular for

465
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:46,579
example in Switzerland Germany is

466
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:50,298
thinking about very much the same model

467
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:52,918
I I believe that this is even my

468
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:54,779
preferred solution take into

469
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,000
consideration the legal framework which

470
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,639
we have within the European Union Canada

471
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,679
had it had didn't have that problem when

472
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,080
they actually legalized in 2019 they had

473
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,259
just adjust the UN conventions they're

474
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,359
getting warning letters every year from

475
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:12,720
the national International narcotics

476
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,659
board but they they actually ignore that

477
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,058
though that that was easier for them to

478
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,798
implement because if you question why is

479
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:21,418
Germany taking that approach that's

480
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,319
because of the Shang agreement and the

481
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:27,120
respective protocols which have been

482
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:30,538
released and which have confirmed that

483
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,819
still the European Union is following

484
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:35,519
the prohibition of cannabis and coming

485
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,740
back to the last part of your question I

486
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,798
don't see that

487
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,079
I don't see that very much happening

488
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,900
within the European Union we will see

489
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,639
more and more

490
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,038
approaches towards the legalization of

491
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,400
recreational Cannabis within certain

492
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:57,119
European countries but this will take

493
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,580
some time and Germany is believing that

494
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,759
with the experience they are having

495
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:04,678
Within These two pillar models for a

496
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,819
period of four years they have

497
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,880
sufficient proof that the legalization

498
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:14,819
has a positive impact on on this Society

499
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,700
has a positive impact on on the

500
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:21,899
attacking of the illicit Market which we

501
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,819
see indeed growing every year and of

502
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,600
course what you can buy on the listed

503
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:30,119
Market has not has in in certain aspects

504
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,240
nothing to do with any kind of quality

505
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,339
or high quality

506
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,259
cannabis products cannabis flowers as we

507
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,779
see it which is our manufactured for

508
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:42,900
example by the by dami Khan and the

509
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,339
other local this local cultivators here

510
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,220
in Germany

511
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:49,500
thank you very much so Cornelius what do

512
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,360
you think how will the Cannabis

513
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,400
regulation also impact existing

514
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,099
Industries like the medicinal cannabis

515
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,340
industry in Germany for example

516
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:01,139
well um if we look at Canada or United

517
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:04,439
States we can assume that certain

518
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,559
product categories will contract in the

519
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,900
sense of for example flower we already

520
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,538
have between 30 to 50 percent of

521
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,298
self-paying patients most of them one

522
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:17,179
can fairly assume our consumers and not

523
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:22,079
are necessarily treating

524
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:24,259
pain issues so we will see a decline in

525
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:29,639
flower sales that's for sure

526
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:32,940
after an initial increase why is that

527
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,380
because what Peter described about how

528
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,380
they want to legalize the recreational

529
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:41,520
Market it's putting cannabis away from a

530
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:44,340
narcotic status to a non-narcotic and

531
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,918
prescriptions will very likely at least

532
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:49,500
double or triple in the beginning and

533
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:54,720
once the Cannabis social clubs are then

534
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,700
open for prescription and for becoming a

535
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,019
member and actually buying product then

536
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,038
we will certainly see in the product

537
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:04,200
category of flower a steep decline I

538
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:07,319
don't see necessarily a big change for

539
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,480
extracts so in the medical cannabis

540
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,939
space you have flour you have extracts

541
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,000
you have already made Pharmaceuticals

542
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,919
for extracts ready-made Pharmaceutical

543
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,259
ready-made Pharmaceuticals I don't see

544
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,960
that much change now

545
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,538
if you look at the market players many

546
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,200
of them have been set up to not only

547
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:30,960
serve the medical space but potentially

548
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:35,340
also be a big player in the recreational

549
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,798
space some of the market players want to

550
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,980
stay in the medical space and say that

551
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:43,740
very clearly others such as damikan we

552
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,599
found this company with a clear view on

553
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,179
regulation in Canada and the United

554
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,459
States and we saw medical cannabis will

555
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,200
be legalized first very likely and

556
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,120
recreational Cannabis eventually will

557
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,298
follow and that was the initial plan

558
00:24:54,119 --> 00:25:01,199
from the beginning so for those who want

559
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:03,960
to Pivot I I mentioned earlier they if

560
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,620
they want to play in the first round

561
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:11,279
they have to become domestic cultivators

562
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:14,418
or get access to domestic product which

563
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,879
will be a challenge I guess for many

564
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:19,679
mostly a Time challenge

565
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,740
I think a fair assumption for any is

566
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,200
starting now to get a building permit to

567
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,480
get the funding to build the facility to

568
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,740
get the cultivars to get do test runs

569
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:35,339
you need at least two years so this will

570
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,579
be what everybody's had will be around

571
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,918
thank you very much I would open uh

572
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,639
first like a warm Round of Applause for

573
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,640
the panelists

574
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,440
and then I would hand over because I bet

575
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,419
there are many questions in that regard

576
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,940
for the German market so let's have a

577
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,580
little bit more questions they're all

578
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,679
excited okay I'm coming uh By the way

579
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,259
when we take the break after this panel

580
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:05,220
for uh coffee and refreshments we invite

581
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:08,519
you to visit our exhibitors uh 3C in ZTE

582
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,319
Tomlin group Vivaldi's Nabi and the

583
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,538
state of Victoria in Australia please

584
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,980
help our exhibitors out and now the

585
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,259
question

586
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,000
hi good morning thank you very much

587
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:21,058
I'm not sure if I should ask for my

588
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,359
money back I come from South Africa we

589
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:27,778
have over 90 licenses awarded by the uh

590
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:31,079
regulator and most of the talk fueled by

591
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:33,119
the government as one might call it

592
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,939
um is that South Africa is potentially a

593
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,000
huge contributor to the global cannabis

594
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,340
scene and of course Germany takes

595
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,179
private place as the market to which all

596
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:47,038
of Africa should aspire to export

597
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,679
um from what I'm hearing here unless I

598
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,140
misunderstood Germany's actually closing

599
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,019
down and Europe potentially thereafter

600
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,580
with regards to allowing the import of

601
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,019
cannabis

602
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:01,259
um let's talk a medical cannabis at this

603
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:03,960
point in time but there is a huge uh

604
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,278
developing capacity for cannabis growing

605
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,460
in Africa and particularly in South

606
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:11,278
Africa under the illusion that we grow

607
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,880
it better we have better land race we do

608
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,440
a cheaper our currency is feeble neither

609
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,659
the Canadians nor the Europeans know how

610
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,058
to grow cannabis like we do and they're

611
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,580
for the Futures ahead of us

612
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:25,440
this is just a belief

613
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:26,939
from what I'm hearing here this is

614
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,798
simply not the case it's all illusory

615
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,538
the biggest markets going to grow it for

616
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,480
itself according to what you want to

617
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:35,519
sell protection and therefore Africa has

618
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,980
to look to itself mind you apparently we

619
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,658
smoke three tons a day in South Africa

620
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,700
at school

621
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,320
but still recreational Cannabis isn't

622
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,360
legal just yet the clubs have not been

623
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,519
approved by the courts and those of us

624
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,619
who are medical cannabis cultivators

625
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,079
have invested a great deal at the

626
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,298
highest end seeking EU GMP

627
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,819
certification by the way under the

628
00:27:54,298 --> 00:28:00,500
advice of European consultants and this

629
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,500
all looks like it's nonsense

630
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:09,119
that's tough

631
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,119
it's tough so

632
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,320
um I everybody here is very aware that

633
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,079
many countries have been scaling up uh

634
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,839
especially to be able to supply Germany

635
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:26,038
and Europe with the world-class high

636
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:29,759
quality Eugene P great cannabis and I

637
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:32,158
think they will be able to continue for

638
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,759
the medical space

639
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:39,419
this is clear in the draft law you can

640
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:42,240
export raw material send it to operators

641
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:45,960
processors such as demikan we transform

642
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,400
it into eugnp great cannabis that can be

643
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,200
sold in the German Market in the

644
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,419
European market or any equivalent Market

645
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,880
with eegmp requirements

646
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:57,720
but for the domestic recreational

647
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,778
Cannabis Market it will be domestic only

648
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,538
supply chain this is what says the law

649
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:06,119
I don't judge it I mean obviously I'm

650
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:10,319
happy about it but this is what we have

651
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:12,239
and and let me add there is still huge

652
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,960
potential in the German Medical Market

653
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,778
we are far away from any kind of uh

654
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,298
Market situation uh there are there's a

655
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:25,619
lot of more potential here what are the

656
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:28,319
hurdles uh for Physicians to prescribe

657
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:30,359
cannabis currently there are a number of

658
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,119
hurdles but it is of course also it's a

659
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,918
narcotic number one number two the

660
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,079
information which the Physicians have

661
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,480
and we have just discussed with a great

662
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,939
greater group of Physicians about the

663
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,919
possibilities to prescribe cannabis what

664
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,380
are the preconditions when can a

665
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,919
physician prescribe cannabis what are

666
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:52,260
the the the the regulations for that uh

667
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,538
if we need more education I think and

668
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:56,579
that's a part actually calling the

669
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:58,679
industry more education of the

670
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:01,019
Physicians to feel more comfortable to

671
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,440
prescribe cannabis as a medicine though

672
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:06,599
lots of potential in there and still I

673
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,380
believe that for the medic vehicle

674
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,879
Market there's still the need of imports

675
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,880
the medical Market also in the future

676
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,820
with regard to this high quality EU GMP

677
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,539
certified products will not be probably

678
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:23,759
not be satisfied by the by the current

679
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:26,940
domestic Market uh we will definitely

680
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:30,000
see Imports in the future we don't know

681
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,399
what is the future of medical cannabis

682
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,599
cultivation in Germany it's not yet

683
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,219
maybe you know more than I but

684
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,339
Cornelius I I have not seen anything

685
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:44,819
from the Bay Farm yet where in which way

686
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,500
they will renew or increase their

687
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:47,720
respective quarters which you have

688
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,480
because

689
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:55,380
you know that the cultivators in Germany

690
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:59,278
have a limit of 10.4 tons for a period

691
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:02,340
of four years plus an additional 10 if

692
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:05,038
I'm not mistaken that that is only part

693
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:06,898
a small part of what the medical Market

694
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,359
is actually needing that it's a reading

695
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,879
that's an easy reason why we are looking

696
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:15,178
into even in the future Imports so there

697
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,880
is space for improvement

698
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,720
yeah let me let me add to that there is

699
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,480
a

700
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,700
the the most of the medical cannabis

701
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,860
import companies in Germany they have

702
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,960
done their sourcing globally so they

703
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:30,178
have stable Supply chains now be it from

704
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,579
Colombia be it from Canada be it from

705
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,320
South Africa

706
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:35,398
but I wouldn't only look there is

707
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,558
potential in the German Market

708
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,719
especially if cannabis is moved from the

709
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:43,019
narcotics act prescription will probably

710
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,659
rise double triple whatever but still a

711
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:48,240
very small Market it's only 25 tons were

712
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:50,039
imported and dispensed 11 tons dispense

713
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,839
to the pharmacies

714
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,579
um there is still potential but I

715
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,918
wouldn't look only to Germany almost

716
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,199
every European country is setting up a

717
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,580
medical cannabis program and if you look

718
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,798
at the UK they have only five

719
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:04,558
indications in Germany there is no limit

720
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:07,079
of indications and won't be afterwards

721
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,119
so look at the other EU States as well

722
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,699
which are setting we're setting up a

723
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,819
kind of medical cannabis programs for

724
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:18,179
for chances to to business or to export

725
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:20,759
and I I must add there is

726
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,340
maybe hope for those producing outside

727
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,859
of Europe

728
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:29,158
that the law initiative might change

729
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:32,699
this is possible and one way it could

730
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:36,360
change is they try to ease access to

731
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,399
cannabis by making it a OTC so that

732
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,099
could be a potential way but this is not

733
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,739
what is proposed right now so I'm just

734
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:46,319
pointing out at the potential

735
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,778
Alternatives path but right now as I

736
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,939
said it's domestic only and and maybe

737
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:54,720
one more remark to that the second

738
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,240
pillar the scientific pilot projects of

739
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,480
course have also a need for Supply so

740
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,278
the question is do we see under the

741
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,440
first pillar the cultivation

742
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,778
associations popping up like mushrooms

743
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,220
everywhere

744
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:10,859
serving the the needs of their members

745
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,460
and who is going to serve later on the

746
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:16,379
scientific pilot projects how house why

747
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,440
it will they spread it out into Germany

748
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,539
does every city has these implementation

749
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,880
of scientific pilot projects has at

750
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:25,679
every state we see that in Switzerland

751
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,120
we have two projects which started

752
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,580
actually earlier this year in

753
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,579
Switzerland in in Basel and in Zurich

754
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:35,099
and we will probably learn from that a

755
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:37,319
little bit more but Germany is

756
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:40,319
significantly larger than Switzerland so

757
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,839
we'll see what how how this Market how

758
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,819
this demand will be then served this

759
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,819
will be interesting to see

760
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,819
okay

761
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,700
uh this is targeted mainly for you

762
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,079
Cornelius but I see that Peter is in

763
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,298
agreement that there's some kind of

764
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:00,658
importation in the future

765
00:33:57,298 --> 00:34:02,158
Cornelius you're not for importation let

766
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,919
me just say this

767
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,740
I spent five years in Jamaica recently I

768
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,200
saw the program from the beginning to

769
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,599
disaster a lot of good things did happen

770
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,579
but

771
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,580
that's a medical program but they make

772
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:19,619
it easy you go into the dispensary you

773
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:21,418
make a phone call to a doctor that's on

774
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,700
board and they give you your medical

775
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:27,059
card right there and then you purchase

776
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:29,699
your flower or your other products

777
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:31,259
when it comes to consumption when Europe

778
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,500
finally

779
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,580
takes these steps baby steps now I

780
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,579
suppose

781
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:41,460
the consumption is going to be huge what

782
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:44,940
millions of pounds a month

783
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:47,579
the craft grows the the grow that you

784
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,679
talked about that you provide what would

785
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:52,918
you say 40 tons a year or something like

786
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,700
that it doesn't make a dent

787
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:58,679
in the overall require some consumption

788
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:01,019
that you're going to have so importation

789
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,980
there's so many countries that are

790
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:06,599
better geographically to grow than in

791
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,480
Germany you're going to have very high

792
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,940
costs here because of energy you have to

793
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,219
build you know facilities buildings

794
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,320
whatnot you know I'm talking about

795
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,379
Colombia mainly they've been shipping

796
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,420
for a hundred years so my question is

797
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:24,720
Cornelius would you be open to the idea

798
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,838
that importation has a place

799
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,239
as maybe a contingency plan but we

800
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,639
shouldn't I think politic against

801
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,858
importation because I don't think you

802
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,519
import call you don't grow coffee here

803
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:40,619
or bananas or or other things you go to

804
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:44,400
the geographical area where it best

805
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:46,500
grows at the most economical uh prices

806
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,920
and and the volume that you're going to

807
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,559
need yeah so for the medical space for

808
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,079
sure this will continue the government

809
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,960
hasn't said anything that contradicts

810
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,619
this assumption that importation will be

811
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,838
possible and we we agree that there will

812
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:06,838
be an increase in prescriptions once

813
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:09,420
it's delisted from being a narcotic on

814
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:12,179
the recreational side it is what the

815
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,180
government proposes domestic only supply

816
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:19,139
chain and I know it's hard to hear but

817
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:21,059
this is what's black on white and this

818
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:23,460
is in line what happened with

819
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:28,019
the legalization of recreation cannabis

820
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:31,380
in Canada no Imports I I hear you loud

821
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:33,960
and clear but it is how regulation moves

822
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,940
and this it's what is being proposed

823
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,400
here in Germany and let me add that

824
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,900
under the first pillar there is no need

825
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,599
for importation

826
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,240
first pillar is homepro and the

827
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,519
cultivation associations so there's

828
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:52,199
there's no need even for for any kind of

829
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,000
cultivation of recreational purposes

830
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,980
here in Germany at this point in time

831
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,139
under the first pillar if it comes into

832
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,260
place the second pillar is different

833
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:03,179
there we may have to see what's going to

834
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,940
happen still the plan of the government

835
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,618
is domestic cultivation will serve even

836
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,119
that market on the second pillar which

837
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,119
are the scientific pilot projects

838
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,039
been very patient and then everyone else

839
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,079
when we go for coffee and pastries you

840
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,000
can pile around these guys and uh and

841
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,800
and pester them uh to your heart's

842
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,619
desire

843
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,480
thank you hi I'm Nicholas from Colombia

844
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,858
so I wouldn't go as far as saying that

845
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,179
we grow the best kind of business as a

846
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,799
guy from South Africa say but we're

847
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:38,460
pretty good at large scale and good

848
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,960
premium quality flowers at a good price

849
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,119
um I don't want to go too deep into the

850
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,500
100 Years of exports of marijuana you

851
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,720
know from my country so I'm just going

852
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,079
to put that aside but I want to say this

853
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,899
I agree that the government is saying

854
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,660
that it has to be domestic only for

855
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,119
recreational space right but we're not

856
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:58,319
thinking about the

857
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,320
consumers in Germany when it comes to

858
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,660
pricing you know and I know that you

859
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,960
guys as pioneers and voices to be here

860
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:08,338
in the Germany legislation to be done I

861
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,800
think it will be good and very important

862
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:14,940
to be heard in the part that probably

863
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:18,359
some imports are going to be needed in

864
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,119
order to accomplish that market in a

865
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,338
good price and in a good quality we are

866
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,140
very aware the German cultivators are

867
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:27,119
not going to be

868
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,239
um you know producing at a very

869
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,400
affordable price so if we put so many

870
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,919
imports from countries that are doing a

871
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,559
good job you know could make actually a

872
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,420
good point for consumers yeah thank you

873
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,440
for raising this point uh production

874
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,579
costs I love it because there is a huge

875
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,300
misunderstanding here

876
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:51,839
um Demi can produces locally

877
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:54,000
domestically and it's about one quarter

878
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,219
of our Top Line and the other three

879
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,880
quarters come from importation so we

880
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:03,059
have several Global suppliers and I know

881
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,380
the prices for which I buy and I know

882
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:06,960
the price for which I produce

883
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,680
domestically and reproduce

884
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,579
full production costs below 2 Euros at

885
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:18,118
one ton annual production capacity so if

886
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:20,060
we scale that goes down and I buy some

887
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,640
product below two Euros

888
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:25,559
Eugene P grade or raw material but most

889
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,259
of them are more expensive and I know

890
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,880
they might be produced cheaper but if

891
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,920
you look at the market prices we're

892
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,559
actually cheaper in producing it

893
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,900
ourselves here in Germany so please keep

894
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,279
that in mind okay thank you I'm sorry to

895
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,480
cut everybody off I know you all had a

896
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,040
lot of questions so the great panel

897
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,039
let's hear it and uh
