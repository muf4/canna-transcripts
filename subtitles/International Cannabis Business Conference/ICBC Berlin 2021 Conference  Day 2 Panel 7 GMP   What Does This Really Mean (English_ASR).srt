8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
differences within the national

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,199
regulations is the difference between

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,359

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,439
and that's the the charlie's lab part

45
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,478
and

46
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,398
so as i said end of this year we should

47
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,519
receive the certification

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840

shortly yeah thank you

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,359
thank you nima and to my left we have a

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,040
peter sickerty who is is that pronounced

52
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,680
the right way

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
she gets the getty okay yeah and he is

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,280
the

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,598
ceo and the founder of welcome medical

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
and uh welcome medical is a danish

57
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,159
company uh

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,840
specialized in extraction of cannabis

59
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,120
and peter is gonna tell us a little bit

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
more about the profile of his company

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,239
so

62
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,759
first of all a small disclaimer i was

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,280
presented as an expert on gmp

64
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,919
i think

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,719
i have a commercial background so

66
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,000
that will be sort of my perspective on

67
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,159
on gmp

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,759
and not so much on the specialized

69
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,239
quality assurance

70
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,759
or regulatory perspective

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,480
but valcon medical is based in denmark

72
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,560
and we are gmp certified

73
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,840
under the danish law for medical

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,400
cannabis

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,519
and we're a contract manufacturer

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,319
so what we do is we

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,480
we support the growers in denmark to

78
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,639
make extracted products that they can

79
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,679
sell under their own brand

80
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,359
we also have a wide label product a thc

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,239
white label product that we are bringing

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,800
to market later this year

83
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,959
and also selling bulk

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,200
um so we received our license here in in

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,799
the end of may this year after an

86
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,919
inspection from the danish medicines

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
agency

88
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,839
and

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,840
now we have products and stability

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
and uh looking forward to the results

91
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,119
yeah

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,719
thank you very much peter

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,439
and as many of you know uh we have a

94
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,120
different gmp regulations

95
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,519
all over the world

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
within the european community

97
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,719
the gmp regulations are kind of

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,400
homogenized but the national application

99
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,639
routines us

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
still differ from country to country we

101
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,719
come through that later nina will tell

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
us how the application process works in

103
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,080
switzerland pete will tell us how the

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,760
application process

105
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,840
works in denmark and then we don't we i

106
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,399
regret that we don't have anybody from

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,798
overseas here on the panel because

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,959
in the united states we have even a

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,560
different regulation it's called cgmp

110
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,918
cgmp means current good manufacturing

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,199
practice which is updated every year in

112
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:34,000
the european community we have a cbdi we

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,680
have gmp regulations which are updated

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,478
every few years in the usa the gmp

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,879
regulation is updated every year and

116
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:48,000
it's even more stricter but the usa also

117
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,719
accepts the german and the european gmp

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
regulations but not every country you

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
can look that up

120
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,040
in the mutual recognition agreement the

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,600
mr agreement

122
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,080
and germany's gmp

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,400
is regulations are accepted since 2019

124
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,478
from the usa so anybody who wants to

125
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,679
know more about that should just check

126
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,159
the mri regulations and it's mentioned

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,720
there country by country which country

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,800
can export medical products under gmp

129
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,240
regulations through the u.s and which

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,680
national regulations the u.s the fda

131
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
does not

132
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,519
does not accept okay then i start with

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,439
the european regulations because

134
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,680
despite we have an official home

135
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,360
organization a home organization in the

136
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,439
european community and in switzerland

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,919
national application routines as i said

138
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,478
before are different and so nema please

139
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:48,560
tell us what what did you have to do to

140
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,319
get a gmp license in switzerland

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,879
so uh

142
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,038
maybe just to to uh

143
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,639
say the same as peter said to call

144
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,079
experts

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,560
me personally would say that's a very

146
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,918
to too good description um maybe in five

147
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,319
years i would call myself an expert um

148
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,318
so what you need for gmp

149
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
with my knowledge what i have now is

150
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,840
definitely a lot of money that's always

151
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,599
good

152
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,638
the right people with the right

153
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
knowledge

154
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
and

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,479
a bulletproof plan

156
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,639
so we started we had uh big ideas we

157
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,000
wanted to do everything and now

158
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,079
basically it's tailored down to

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,319
something very small and specific and

160
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,399
for what we then specifically applied so

161
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,199
there are forms that you need to fill

162
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,799
out by the swiss medic which i said

163
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,879
before is the the authority in

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
switzerland which certifies

165
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,918
uh companies

166
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,280
um we applied for specifically um

167
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,879
blending

168
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:51,198
oils now um

169
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,439
in different uh percentages

170
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,240
which we also defined already

171
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,918
um filling them in 10 uh 30 and 50

172
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,400
milliliter bottles

173
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,279
and capping them and labeling them so

174
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,679
that's the that's the whole gmp uh chain

175
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,679
that we applied for everything before we

176
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,918
didn't do that no extraction that's what

177
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,800
peter's doing so i'll be the customer of

178
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,359
peterson we just realized before

179
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,199
and then we can bring gmp products on

180
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,639
the market so

181
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,400
basically

182
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,319
you need the right team um you need to

183
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,758
build up the quality management system

184
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
you need to know exactly what you want

185
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,520
to do what product the inspector wants

186
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,800
to know exactly what you

187
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,000
what you intend to do is it realistic um

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,240
and then the process from the day you

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
give your your application and can take

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
up to 18 months

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,918
until they give the certification so

192
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,638
that's basically

193
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,038
the procedure in switzerland yeah and

194
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,560
with that application or as soon as you

195
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,318
get uh

196
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,399
as soon as you have it you're also

197
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,000
allowed to export to other european

198
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,120
countries because switzerland is not

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,879
part of the eu but this form is accepted

200
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,360
in other countries as well isn't it

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,319
that's correct yes it is yeah and uh

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,479
yeah my question to peter is you are

203
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,400
from a country within the euro computer

204
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,079
community denmark is a member of the

205
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,038
european community

206
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,359
and

207
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,918
in the green room before you told me

208
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
still your application is a little bit

209
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,439
different from for example the german

210
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,639
application form

211
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,839
and first of all why do we need gmp in

212
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,800
the cannabis

213
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,279
farmer

214
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,199
why do we need gmp

215
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,359
so so i guess

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,839
what is gmp which is kind of like the

217
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,038
the question here and

218
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,959
and is it different or not i would say

219
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,759
within europe

220
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,598
it's uh it's pretty clear to me

221
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,000
what it is because

222
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,839
the european commission and the ema have

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
set out the um

224
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,959
the guidelines um which is in the

225
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,519
uterulex and the directives

226
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,919
then it's up to each country to

227
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,159
implement those directives in their own

228
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,159
law

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,200
and then there is also the ich guideline

230
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
so

231
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
basically the whole framework for and

232
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,519
and all the rules and guidelines and

233
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,040
regulations exist and are the same

234
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,159
when it comes to

235
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:20,559
to to cannabis

236
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:22,879
i guess the whole purpose of gmp is

237
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,039
taking care of the patients really and

238
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,559
making sure that there is consistency

239
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,199
traceability

240
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:32,000
everything and as cannabis is a medicine

241
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,920
and it's a prescription medicine that's

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
being prescribed to people with

243
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,519
illnesses

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,120
then of course it should be

245
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,120
produced under gmp

246
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,159
now

247
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,600
in denmark

248
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,639
we have a

249
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,440
like a special law governing medical

250
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,919
cannabis because it does differ from

251
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
other medicine that just applies to

252
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,919
the medicine law

253
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
um and the reason for that is partly

254
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,599
also that we don't have to go through

255
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,519
clinical trials

256
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,278
and that's really the catch with medical

257
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,639
cannabis that that's how it really

258
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,919
differs from

259
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,838
conventional

260
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,838
medicine so to speak or pharmaceuticals

261
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,360
so the application process in denmark

262
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,278
and the

263
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
inspection from the danish medicines

264
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,919
agency is

265
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,000
very much the same as it is for other

266
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,759
companies producing medicine

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
everything is

268
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,078
everything we do is embedded in the

269
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,040
uterus and in the law

270
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,759
and they do a gmp inspection

271
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,559
the license we get is

272
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:42,399
the same as a gmp certification it's

273
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,399
just under the danish cannabis law

274
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,278
the catch is i would say

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,320
when you have your

276
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,439
gmp certification as a manufacturer

277
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,399
is the product registration

278
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
and that's where country to country it

279
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,879
really differs a lot

280
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,720
because in denmark as an example

281
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,600
under the danish program

282
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,600
you can produce a product under gmp a

283
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,120
flower or an oil

284
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,639
and you can file a product registration

285
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,839
application

286
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,519
and it if it's approved it's on the

287
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,399
market at market and it's on the

288
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,639
pharmacy shelf branded under your

289
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,480
company brand

290
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,159
and the doctor prescribes it to the

291
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,639
patient

292
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,480
right now we have a

293
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,679
we have jill capsules on the market in

294
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,200
denmark

295
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:39,599
there's still magistral prepared

296
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
cannabis on the market too

297
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,920
but else we are going to see more

298
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,839
products coming into the market

299
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,399
it's also going to be

300
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,160
a lot more common for the doctors to to

301
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,159
prescribe cannabis because they have

302
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,639
more options

303
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,120
in germany

304
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,240
i'm not an expert on it yet but i know

305
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,039
that it has to go through some steps

306
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,600
in a magistral process it cannot just be

307
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,719
registered and put on the pharmacy shelf

308
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,959
there's a few additional steps

309
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
and that's really where it differs a lot

310
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,078
within

311
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,279
the european union

312
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,439
the last step of the supply chain

313
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,078
would you say peter that

314
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,399
this is one of the reasons why denmark

315
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:28,000
meanwhile has i think six cannabis

316
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,399
producers and the law is not as uh long

317
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,278
implemented as it was in germany it's a

318
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,360
lot much newer and yeah in this uh does

319
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,519
it is it easier to start in the industry

320
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,959
due to the to the uh

321
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,959
to the regulations or to the

322
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,719
registration to the cannabis medicine

323
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,759
registration would you say it's easier

324
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,160
to make a startup in denmark

325
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,559
i would say nothing is easy when it

326
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,278
comes to starting a cannabis company and

327
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,159
i think most people in this room will

328
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,639
recognize that

329
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,679
i guess the framework we have in denmark

330
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
is

331
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,359
more transparent

332
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,078
and the

333
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,278
room we have to conduct commercial

334
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,120
operations is probably also more

335
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,039
transparent

336
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,879
as i think i heard earlier there was

337
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,639
only really three licenses for

338
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,240
cultivation

339
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,720
and some extraction that has been

340
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,879
granted in in germany

341
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,440
whereas in in denmark

342
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,559
i think there were at a time about 50

343
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,320
companies

344
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,119
that had gotten a

345
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,040
development license which means that you

346
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,000
are allowed to

347
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:38,559
practice sort of with cannabis until

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
you're ready for your inspection

349
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,679
so

350
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
easier that's a relative word but i

351
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,838
would say more transparent

352
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,039
yes i believe so

353
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
thank you

354
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,879
nima a short look in switz a short look

355
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,519
to switzerland

356
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,240
when i when i see all those cbd

357
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,278
productions in switzerland

358
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,519
i see

359
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,439
some of them are gmp

360
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
some of them are not

361
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,320
so

362
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:11,599
what advantages do you have as a gmp

363
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,600
producer in switzerland

364
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,759
that's a good question

365
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,759
i think the it depends

366
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,240
what we're talking about is it flower

367
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,519
production um because if it's flower

368
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,039
production

369
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,120
it can currently only be for export

370
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,679
so that that's already paints the

371
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,120
picture for switzerland we only have

372
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:38,319
small small patients for certain oils

373
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,159
which are produced under gmp yeah so you

374
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
you do need that plus the narcotic

375
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,600
license because it's still a narcotic in

376
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:49,360
switzerland the thc um but cbd stories

377
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,759
dvds are like cottages thc no no cbd is

378
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,039
basically free depends then in what what

379
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,519
kind of products you put it on the

380
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,120
market depends then on under what

381
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,759
regulations in falls then the whole

382
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
novel food story comes

383
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,838
so

384
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,239
maybe i'll just use that that example so

385
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,199
um at at the moment as we speak many

386
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,000
oils cbd oils under under zero two

387
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,000
percent are being taken out uh from the

388
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,078
stores from the

389
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,919
uh pharmacists the cantonal pharmacists

390
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,319
which have the power to do that

391
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,360
and just last week they came to a store

392
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,920
where our product was inside and uh

393
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,919
we we had a different approach of um

394
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,759
registering the product and also the

395
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,078
whole documentation which we already

396
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,519
have i mean we don't have the gmp gmp

397
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,599
certification yet but 95 of the of the

398
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,639
95 percent of the sops are all already

399
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,440
in place we're already working like gmp

400
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,079
um our products do cost more because the

401
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,120
employees cost more the qps cost a lot

402
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,120
of money

403
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,078
and it just costs

404
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,759
the costs are very high and

405
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,519
when we talk to the to the cantona

406
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,199
pharmacist and showed him all the the

407
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
paperwork we have

408
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,599
at the end our oils are still on the

409
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:04,399
shelf now so i think that

410
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
that is a major difference it's it it

411
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,078
shows that there's some security behind

412
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
that and they also understand we want to

413
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,439
bring safe products

414
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,319
to the to the shelves

415
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,639
yeah

416
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,720
and generally also we speak about two

417
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,519
very different markets because in

418
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,320
switzerland cbd is also a recreational

419
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,600
product but also a medical product sold

420
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,199
in pharmacies

421
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,519
in denmark uh

422
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,359
there is actually uh in your in your

423
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,959
company we only talk about medical

424
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,839
credit products

425
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,879
and

426
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
what would you say um in in denmark

427
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,399
what's about the domestic market we're

428
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,039
talking all the we're talking about

429
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,519
exporting all the time but what is about

430
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,159
the domestic market what about selling

431
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,039
gmp products in danish pharmacies is

432
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,838
that already a big market there

433
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,078
well i mean

434
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
we're obviously also focused on export

435
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,319
because denmark is a small

436
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,838
small country with only about six

437
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,879
million people so

438
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,078
it's not a huge market um but i think

439
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,359
when we're talking markets it also comes

440
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,480
down to

441
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,599
the doctor's perception of of medical

442
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,279
cannabis

443
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,879
the challenge in denmark is that the

444
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,798
like the doctors

445
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,959
don't really understand it and they

446
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,318
they're not educated and they're very

447
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,798
reluctant to prescribing it so instead

448
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,119
we have we have some cannabis clinics

449
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:32,240
that are specialized in prescribing it

450
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,479
and confident with

451
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,960
with having patients and starting them

452
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,960
up on on medical cannabis

453
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,919
same thing as the at the hospitals they

454
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,919
also have doctors that are

455
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,720
using medical cannabis and prescribing

456
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,480
it out of the hospital

457
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,240
we have seen

458
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,120
some products on the danish market there

459
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
was an oil that was imported from from

460
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,879
canada

461
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,720
it was on the market for about

462
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,799
i think it was two years or a little

463
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,720
less than two years before it was

464
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:07,279
unfortunately taken off the market again

465
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,160
in three years and two quarters i think

466
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,519
the total cannabis sales was about 10

467
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,798
million euros

468
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,279
in in denmark which is definitely not

469
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,798
insignificant and there is a there's a

470
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,879
reimbursement program that's 50 for for

471
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,000
patients of the price they pay at the

472
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,080
pharmacy

473
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,038
and 100 if you're terminally ill

474
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,119
so

475
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,720
i think we will see over time when more

476
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,319
products come into the market because

477
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,919
now there is really only one which is

478
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,639
the gel capsules

479
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,640
and we'll start to see that the

480
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,960
doctors get more confident in

481
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,200
prescribing it the patients are showing

482
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,079
good effects

483
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,919
and

484
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,678
i guess that's when it will start to be

485
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,840
more normalized and

486
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
a general perception in the public that

487
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,279
this is

488
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,599
this is a thing that works for many

489
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,720
patients and that's when the acceptance

490
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,119
will come

491
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,000
and what i hope is that

492
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,558
um if we manage to do that

493
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,839
in denmark as sort of a platform that

494
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,558
works well

495
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,798
um other countries within the eu will

496
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,558
look at us as a as a case

497
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,200
and take some of the

498
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:20,399
of the knowledge we have created um to

499
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,679
open up the markets there

500
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
thank you peter

501
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,080
in switzerland nima it's a kind of a bit

502
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,199
a little bit different situation you

503
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,319
have a very big recreational cbd market

504
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,120
you have kind of a small medical cbd

505
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,200
market in switzerland and as you told

506
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:42,079
before you have the

507
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,519
possibility to export gmp products

508
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,759
is there any

509
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:49,679
idea or do you know

510
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:52,400
would it be possible to export gmp

511
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,280
a cbd flower and products to german

512
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,038
pharmacies is there is there any uh

513
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,599
anything going on in the in this

514
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,599
direction

515
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,880
so me personally since we do not produce

516
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,880
the gmp flowers

517
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,480
i'm not really

518
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,280
100 up to up to date with that but i

519
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,319
would now assume that if if you can

520
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,759
register a medicinal product which is a

521
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,439
flower with

522
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,558
certain content of cbd and and thc

523
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,120
um

524
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,519
then you and it meets all the parameters

525
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,839
then i don't see really

526
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,038
an issue with that because i i was

527
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,720
thinking in german pharmacies uh the cb

528
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,279
we have a very

529
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,679
small range of cbe strains and

530
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,399
switzerland has a very big range of cbd

531
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,640
strains and a lot of patients in germany

532
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,519
say oh i don't find the right cbd strain

533
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,880
and i wonder why no company had the idea

534
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,279
yet to import medical great cannabis via

535
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,080
with a gmp production certificate to

536
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,720
germany because it's also paid better in

537
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,558
the pharmacy you know in switzerland

538
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,038
there's a very big competition on the

539
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,918
cbd market and if you can export to a

540
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,319
german

541
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,000
pharmacy or to a german medical market

542
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,319
the prices are much more stable than

543
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,480
what you have in switzerland and

544
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,158
then sorry what you have in switzerland

545
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
right now so

546
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,919
so you don't know anything going on in

547
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,798
this direction

548
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,480
um

549
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,400
what about cbd

550
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,880
flower production or

551
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
extraction in denmark is that also a big

552
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,679
thing

553
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,759
um

554
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,919
well i can't really speak for the retail

555
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,400
market or the cosmetics of fast-moving

556
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,720
consumer goods because we're not at all

557
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,759
involved in that

558
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,000
we're only focused on medical

559
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,359
and prescription medicine but

560
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,640
in that context with cbd that's also a

561
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:52,319
product that's going to be available

562
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,400
from us too so extracting cbd flour

563
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,119
that's cultivated under

564
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,919
gacp and gmp as well

565
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,359
but it is prescription medicine in in

566
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,280
denmark and

567
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,678
it's they're not allowed as a retail

568
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,119
product oh it's prescription medicine in

569
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,559
denmark so that also differs from the

570
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,479
rest of the european market kind of

571
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,879
doesn't it yeah i mean there is

572
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,440
obviously opportunities to buy it online

573
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,679
and and whatnot but um but no it's it's

574
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,159
not allowed under any novel food or

575
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,320
anything in denmark you see

576
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,360
products that it's that's extracted from

577
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,480
hemp

578
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,918
um

579
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,720
it's a it's him seed oil branded as cbd

580
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
so

581
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,319
yeah it's a little bit of a graystone

582
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,200
and i i'm i don't know much about it but

583
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,839
um it's not a it's not a huge thing in

584
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,798
denmark this retail cbd

585
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:43,678
as we see like two countries and two

586
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,000
very different circumstances as i say

587
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,320
and i'd really like to go a lot deeper

588
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,640
into it but time runs away we only have

589
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,200
i think four minutes left for this panel

590
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,520
and this is the time for the audience to

591
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,919
uh for questions so anybody who has

592
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,720
questioned him to me or the panelists

593
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,919
please it is the time for questions

594
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
i need my exercise

595
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,400
hello my name is renominio i'm from the

596
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
holland green science group

597
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
uh

598
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,399
you asked one question michael is why do

599
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,639
we have gmp anyway i can think of these

600
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,120
things but there was not an answer of a

601
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,038
straight answer maybe the panel can

602
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,319
answer that question

603
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,558
pete yeah

604
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,439
i actually believe that i i did mention

605
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,440
it

606
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,919
but know why we have gnp that's because

607
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,919
of the patients it's a it's rules and

608
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,080
regulations uh

609
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,840
embedded and directed from the

610
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,960
directives from the european commission

611
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,038
and the ema to protect the patients and

612
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,840
take care of patient safety

613
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,400
so

614
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,000
gmp i mean it's a it's rules that you

615
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,240
comply with it's a

616
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,480
the way you you build your company based

617
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,599
on on those guidelines and it's

618
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,960
it's consistency it's traceability um

619
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,959
it's patient safety really

620
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,319
well

621
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,200
he was asking if it's the same for the

622
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:11,439
recreational market and we don't have a

623
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,600
recreational market in in denmark so

624
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
we can maybe hear over here i can answer

625
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,558
this question

626
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,759
for example

627
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,879
the

628
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,119
market which is gonna be hopefully gonna

629
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,640
be built up in switzerland is planned to

630
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,319
be gmc

631
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,600
which is not as high as gmp

632
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,720
over here

633
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,759
yes uh hello my name is is martin

634
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,640
um mr nima maybe this is for you what is

635
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,879
the the difference between what you do

636
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,679
then what standard pharmaceutical

637
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,600
companies do for producing syrups or

638
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,759
medicinal shampoos etc because you are

639
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,278
only doing blending and packaging as i

640
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,960
understand so what are the the

641
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:55,679
difference in the regulations if you do

642
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,679
it with cannabis based products

643
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,440
um so we we are just

644
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,480
purely concentrating on on the filling

645
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,679
capping

646
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,919
blending

647
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,200
because for us in switzerland that was

648
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,080
the the most clear way we can go without

649
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,840
going into any gray area

650
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,839
and we wanted to

651
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,319
have a have a bulletproof business plan

652
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,480
and not hope okay novel food will kick

653
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,000
in will not kick in so basically we can

654
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,759
fill in captain anything it doesn't have

655
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,880
to be cannabis at the end of the day

656
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:32,000
that's like plan b in case everything uh

657
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,720
you know goes the wrong way basically

658
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,960
so

659
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,000
we we chose that strategy that in case

660
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,000
that route doesn't work we can do that

661
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,759
our lab also does analytics we also

662
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,319
focus on analytics and on different

663
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,919
cannabinoids we're working a lot on on

664
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,960
those because we believe in the the

665
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,000
different

666
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,079
compositions working together

667
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,839
and then we also have two other

668
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:58,158
technologies which will implement in the

669
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:02,720
laboratory and we are purely focusing on

670
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:05,679
that um especially in the cannabis side

671
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,000
and if i'm allowed to add i think

672
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,519
anybody should know when it comes to gmp

673
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,599
the packaging

674
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,599
is the most uh

675
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,719
the thing you have to invest the most

676
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,119
money in

677
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,278
yeah the production of course if you

678
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,038
don't make the production yourself you

679
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,200
just have to do the packaging but the

680
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:27,038
packaging is a very big investment isn't

681
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,038
it it's not cheap

682
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,000
any more question we have time for one

683
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,000
more question

684
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,640
apparently you're very comprehensive

685
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,278
okay then we are again the ones who save

686
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,720
the time for the next panelists so we

687
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,240
catch up the five minutes we lost before

688
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,519
i would suggest

689
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,599
and i thank you peter for being here and

690
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:57,278
thank you nima for being here i think we

691
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,879
got a very good information on gmp and

692
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,240
gmp practices

693
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,400
and maybe

694
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,839
let me ask you a very very final

695
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
question

696
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,359
um

697
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,000
how important is gmp to have cannabis

698
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:16,000
accepted by the

699
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
traditional pharmaceutical industry

700
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,599
well

701
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:23,359
i i believe that it's more that doctors

702
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,599
and the patient safety so gmp is vital

703
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,079
being a doctor having a

704
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,798
an ill patient with a serious disease or

705
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,038
being under chemotherapy or whatever

706
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:36,398
it's vital for them that that

707
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,440
that cannabis medicine is produced under

708
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,599
tmp

709
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,679
that's uh i would say that's the that's

710
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,599
the whole concept and the whole idea is

711
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,720
patient safety

712
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:50,158
would you agree if i say without gmp

713
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,000
cannabis had no chance to be accepted on

714
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,640
bicycle cannabis medicine has no chance

715
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,880
to be accepted on a broad range

716
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,600
yeah i would definitely agree

717
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,919
