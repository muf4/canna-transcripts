00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,720
opportunity to see

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
what this conference has done for

25
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,640
cannabis around the world and it's

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,040
really remarkable and what i'd really

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,640
like to have everyone do is give the

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
icbc crew a hand

29
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,758
and then what i would like you all to do

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,640
is really look around this room

31
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,200
look at who's in this room it's a lot of

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
a lot of men i i guess i shouldn't be

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
surprised there's a lot of men here but

34
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,039
i want you guys to look around and see

35
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,239
who the people are that you're working

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,600
with that are changing the world because

37
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,078
that is what we're doing here in

38
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,078
cannabis

39
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,639
all right oh clicker

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,639
there we go

41
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
randall

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,119
there we go

43
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:28,238
bang went public in july of 2019.

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,560
in december of 2019 bang's founder and

45
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
ceo stepped down and the board asked me

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
to step in

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
and accept the permanent

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,519
president ceo role having been a real

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,879
estate investor for 25 years i'm really

50
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
comfortable in the investment

51
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,318
environment

52
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,919
i'm comfortable with deal flow i'm

53
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,958
comfortable sitting around a table full

54
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,079
of men

55
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,239
talking about finances looking over

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
balance sheets and p l's

57
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,000
so i didn't have any problem saying yes

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,158
because i also had been working at bang

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,919
for about five years at that point and

60
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,439
i'd been in the cannabis industry for

61
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,439
about seven years at that point and

62
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,598
really felt comfortable in accepting

63
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,639
that role what i didn't have was capital

64
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,639
markets experience

65
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,000
wrong direction

66
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,199
what bang has are some really great

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,878
partners

68
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,280
one of the partners i have is here with

69
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,479
me today his name is sean connecker he's

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
over there

71
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,679
he's with plant-based investment

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,080
corporation which is a publicly traded

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,239
company on the cannabis the canadian

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
stock exchange and they are an

75
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
investment company that puts investments

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,599
together for

77
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
plant-based and actually fungi-based

78
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,518
they're doing some mushroom stuff too so

79
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,079
i was fortunate because my company had

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,920
the backing of a really strong partner

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
and then in the in the meantime i had

82
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,039
been putting deals together with

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,719
companies like true leave they're on the

84
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,039
csc how many of you raise your hands

85
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,400
have heard of true leave

86
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,479
they're one of i think they're the

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,158
largest north american cannabis company

88
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,598
and they're one of the only profitable

89
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,959
ones

90
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,878
we have a deal within diva in canada

91
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
and i am here

92
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,438
doing this conference and zurich because

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
i'd like to bring bang into europe with

94
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,878
our thc products

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,759
so we started

96
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,399
11 years ago we were born in oakland

97
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,039
our founder was a master chocolatier

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
european trained chef to cuisine and the

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,439
chocolate that we've been putting in the

100
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,000
marketplace

101
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,360
is european quality now i have some some

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,639
swiss people out there that want to

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
challenge me and i brought some

104
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,840
chocolate i smuggled it in and

105
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,839
you're on here we go

106
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,159
this is where i'm from this is absorkee

107
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,159
montana

108
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,280
right now it's got a thousand people but

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,199
when i grew up there it had 800 people a

110
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,478
little small town about an hour from the

111
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,840
next we we had a grocery store but if we

112
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,519
really wanted to go shopping we had to

113
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,079
drive an hour away

114
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,519
and that's the view from my the ranch

115
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,120
where i grew up and my parents still

116
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,839
live there

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,240
so i was really lucky to grow up in a

118
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,399
place that's so beautiful

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,879
and also i have this affinity for

120
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,679
germany and this connection to germany

121
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,519
um

122
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,038
and i work for this great company and so

123
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,120
life is pretty good but i'll tell you

124
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,439
it's really good to be bang because

125
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,879
after i took over two years ago we

126
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,560
cleaned a few things up we got a really

127
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,199
strong balance sheet we've got great

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
financials we've got amazing products 11

129
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
years of history putting millions of

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,478
chocolate bars in people's hands

131
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,399
and

132
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,918
people then say to me how did you get

133
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,399
into cannabis

134
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:34,079
and i say i was born

135
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,799
i'm 52 my dad's 71. he's been growing

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,079
cannabis for 56 years that's him in his

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,199
outdoor grow i don't know if you can see

138
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:45,839
my face that's me and his indoor grow

139
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,919
dad dear old dad he's a vietnam vet ptsd

140
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,599
doesn't drink but uses cannabis it makes

141
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,839
him feel better so i grew up in an

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,600
environment where cannabis was normal

143
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,038
and then my first cousin on my mom's

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,800
side is dj mugs from cypress hill

145
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,439
and that's him getting the star on the

146
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,600
walk of fame a couple years ago

147
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,399
also the cannabis activist how many of

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
you have heard of cyprus hill

149
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,879
yeah

150
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,879
insane in the membrane

151
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,160
he and i are the same age we raised our

152
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,360
kids together

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
and he asked me to do a deal for him in

154
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,160
cannabis we've been investing in real

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,319
estate together

156
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,319
for about 15 years at that point so when

157
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,400
it was time for can for cyprus to get

158
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,680
back into the industry he came to me and

159
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,918
said would you help us find a deal that

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,519
is good for cyprus so i went out and

161
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,599
that's what i did that's when i jumped

162
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,079
into the industry but these are my two

163
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,479

spain for her senior year of college and

166
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,038

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,399
give a talk um

168
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,240

169
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,519
that was skeet shooting so

170
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,280
she's like do you think they'll be mad

171
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,399
if you're if they see me with a gun i'm

172
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,478
like no nobody's gonna care

173
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,399
my kids are jenzenials i don't know if

174
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,199
you guys know what that means but they

175
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,318
were born in that really weird spot

176
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,840
where

177
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
um

178
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,839
they know what a phone book is they know

179
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,318
how to dial a rotary phone

180
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,399
and you know so it's the analog

181
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,199
world that they were born into but the

182
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,879
digital world caught up to them and now

183
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
they're in the digital world they're not

184
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,959
quite millennials um they're not gen

185
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
zers they're they're right in that

186
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,318
middle which gives me an advantage

187
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,199
because they teach me a lot

188
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,439
so

189
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,400
muggs asked me to get into

190
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,879
cannabis because i was doing real estate

191
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,198
and i came from that little small town

192
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,560
and what happened was i have these two

193
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,360
athletes

194
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,800
and

195
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,840
i didn't want to tell anybody i was

196
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,360
working in cannabis i was

197
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,799
scared that there would be blowback on

198
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,720
my kids how many of you in this room

199
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,280
have a little bit of doubt or or

200
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,199
sometimes take a beat before you say i'm

201
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,079
in cannabis because there's a stigma to

202
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,720
it

203
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,159
a few of you yeah i mean it's it's a

204
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,840
little bit uncomfortable because we work

205
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,879
in this world where

206
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,638
we haven't quite as a world accepted

207
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,160
cannabis we're still in prohibition in

208
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,400
the united states and so i was careful

209
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,800
about what i would say or so that my

210
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,159
kids didn't have any um

211
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
any blowback

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,680
but it's the really interesting thing is

213
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,400
from so that's them that zenial thing

214
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
but

215
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,519
as you get farther on into this graph

216
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,759
what you'll find is that

217
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,278
not only are the kids growing up with

218
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,958
technology

219
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,799
but they're growing up in a world where

220
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,399
cannabis is normal

221
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,879
for this generation

222
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,958
there is no stigma and they wonder

223
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,200
what's wrong with us because we're

224
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,079
fighting about legalization because

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,200
we're we know that we've been using

226
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,839
cannabis for millennia literally they

227
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,839
are finding elements of cannabis in the

228
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,560
pyramids of egypt

229
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,519
and we just had the fda

230
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,559
skip phase three clinical trials and let

231
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,200
pfizer

232
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,000
have approval on that vaccine but we

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,320
can't get cannabis legalized and our

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,799
kids are wondering what is wrong with

235
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
you adults

236
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,159
our world's on fire

237
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,639
the planet is

238
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,958
shaking us off like a wet dog because

239
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,039
we're we're ruin i mean we've not done

240
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,399
this very well for them and i think this

241
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,719
generation is

242
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
wanting us to wake up

243
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
and that's why i think my kids make me

244
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,839
better at my job so i get in the

245
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,480
cannabis industry seven years ago

246
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,560
and

247
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,039
i didn't tell anybody what i did and

248
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,958
then high times outed me

249
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,480
and they named me the most influential

250
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,838
woman in cannabis um one of them in 2018

251
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,639
and the most influential woman in

252
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,200
cannabis in 2019 and asked me to give a

253
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,360
speech and it went viral and the next

254
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,879
thing i knew everybody in my little town

255
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
knew what i did

256
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,200
and when i go home sometimes

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
some people cross the street when they

258
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
see me coming

259
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,639
it's interesting cana phobia is live

260
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,359
alive and well and that's what i'm here

261
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,360
to talk about

262
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,639
because i shouldn't be afraid to tell

263
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,958
people what i do

264
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,278
bang has been putting we've put millions

265
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,119
of chocolate bars in consumers hands in

266
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,039
nine u.s states

267
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,039
we are the number one

268
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,838
chocolate in canada

269
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,719
and in 2020 last year

270
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,600
we were the number one sku in ontario

271
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,639
meaning bang chocolate bang milk

272
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,519
chocolate

273
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,879
sold more units than any flour or

274
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,879
pre-roll

275
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,919
in the country in the province of

276
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,078
ontario now flour and pre-rolls sold

277
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,399
more than edibles so as a

278
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,199
as an um

279
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,200
what do you call it

280
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,919
you know

281
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,319
basically

282
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,719
flour and edibles flour and pre-roll

283
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
sell more than edibles but not one

284
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,519
flower and not one pre-roll sold more

285
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,040
than bang chocolate so we're we're out

286
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
there kicking butt

287
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,639
we're out there doing deals with true

288
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,759
leave and we're putting

289
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,439
people

290
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,439
chocolate people's hands and they feel

291
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,680
better when they use our products i get

292
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,240
emails from people saying i haven't

293
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,359
slept like this since i started using a

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,879
product

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
people are using it for seizure

296
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,519
disorders for

297
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,240
anxiety and i've got a product that

298
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,039
actually improves people's well-being

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,919
and what am i worried about when i stand

300
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,120
proud and say i'm the ceo of an edibles

301
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,879
company

302
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,039
and it's because we've got this stigma

303
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,720
that we're fighting

304
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,919
and i think

305
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,160
improving people's well-being is

306
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,360
something that should make you feel

307
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,078
important

308
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,839
and everybody in this room should commit

309
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,078
to feeling important that what we're

310
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,000
doing is changing the world

311
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,759
so i had an epiphany the other day which

312
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
is why i chose this talk

313
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,078
i went to a conference and i heard every

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,559
single in fact i was at the

315
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,120
um global investment forum yesterday and

316
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,518
what people were focused on was money

317
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,839
oh this this company's doing this many

318
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,600
million dollars the you know germany's

319
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
the third largest cannabis market in the

320
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,040
world 30 billion dollars is the size of

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,600
the u.s market 200 billion dollars is

322
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,039
the size of the u.s illicit market so

323
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
there's this big gap between what's

324
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,039
actually happening

325
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,919
which is lots of people are using

326
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,519
cannabis and what we're really willing

327
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,278
to talk about what we're really willing

328
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,440
to talk about is money

329
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,439
that's what we prioritize

330
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,800
and i'm thinking wait a minute the

331
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
products that we're putting in people's

332
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,838
hands are helping veterans with ptsd or

333
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,159
helping people with parkinson's they're

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,480
making the world feel better

335
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,078
and we're talking about money and it

336
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,360
brought me to the realization that

337
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:58,078
that's what is wrong with this world

338
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,240
that's why our world is on fire we know

339
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,278
that hemp cleans the soil

340
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,039
we know that it takes

341
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:07,360
2700 liters of water to make a single

342
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,679
cotton t-shirt

343
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,440
when it doesn't cost that much water to

344
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,439
make a hemp t-shirt but what we're going

345
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
to do is keep making cotton t-shirts

346
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
when we're sending pallets of them to

347
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,320
africa we don't need any more t-shirts

348
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,679
but we want to make more money because

349
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,639
that's what we value and

350
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,159
my kids and that generation

351
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
we're going to cost them this planet

352
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,919
we're costing them this planet so i

353
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,440
think the people in this room need to

354
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,039
understand that this isn't something

355
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
we're doing for money

356
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,000
this is something we're doing for money

357
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,759
and it's something we're doing for

358
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,159
well-being

359
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,838
and what i'll tell you is that the

360
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,799
conservatives in america i'm sure you

361
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,639
guys all

362
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,599
from across the pond look at us and

363
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,839
wonder what are we doing we we put that

364
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,879
he who shall not be named in

365
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,399
to uh the presidency and a whole bunch

366
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,439
of weird stuff happened after he got

367
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,198
there

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,279
but

369
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,719
what we all knew and what we all

370
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,639
expected is that he was going to put a

371
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,959
focus on the economy he did not put a

372
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,639
focus on well-being we're trying to do

373
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,958
that now

374
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,198
cannabis is a gateway to wellness to

375
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,518
vulgar fool

376
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,838
to well-being it's going to clean our

377
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,078
air it's going to clean our soil it's

378
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,279
going to help our bodies it's going to

379
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:26,000
help our communities so i'm here giving

380
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,000
all of us a call to action to start

381
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,278
prioritizing well-being

382
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
versus

383
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,838
money

384
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,719
in germany

385
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,559
you guys are in the greatest position to

386
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,680
do it

387
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,919
yes these this is for 2024.

388
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,919
right now germany is still the second

389
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,679
largest cannabis market

390
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,000
or excuse me the third largest cannabis

391
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,439
market by spending which is amazing

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,519
because you don't have recreational

393
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
cannabis yet imagine what's going to

394
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,919
happen with the population density of

395
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,879
europe when recreational cannabis is

396
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,198
passed

397
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,000
and look we already know everybody's

398
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,719
using it so all of the politicians here

399
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,078
let's stop pretending that this is about

400
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,079
money your citizens are using cannabis

401
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:16,239
but you people who i love so much i came

402
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,479

403
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,159

411
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,799
plant-based medicine first you need to

412
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,959

415
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,759

little stressed out i love that i love

418
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,360
your culture and what you guys can do is

419
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,559
help us make this type of transition

420
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,039
because you

421
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,919
can be the example for the world you

422
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,679
already are we already talk about german

423
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,838
engineering we already talk about

424
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:09,039
precision we already know that your

425
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,800
politics are set up to not be played one

426
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,319
party against each other

427
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,719
you guys are

428
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,079
really poised to come in and be the

429
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,079
example of what's right

430
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,439
and if anybody wants this slideshow i'll

431
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,439
i'll just come up to me and i'll just

432
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
give you a copy

433
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,160
now we've got a model

434
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,958
already that exists and it's the sin

435
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,039
country scotland iceland new zealand how

436
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,479
many of you know what i'm about to tell

437
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:39,278
you about these sin countries

438
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,120
nobody okay well here we go

439
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,799
the sin countries

440
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:48,639
formed a union in 2017 and they agreed

441
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,879
to stop using gdp as their measure for

442
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,600
the success of their economy

443
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,799
what they use is the well-being of their

444
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,159
citizens

445
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,758
and so what they have done is created a

446
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,039
measure

447
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,360
of how the economy is doing it's not

448
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,519
just the gold and silver reserves

449
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,958
it's not just the output of work or the

450
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,838
goods and services that are being

451
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,720
produced it's things like access to

452
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,798
green space the happiness of children

453
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,400
access to housing none of that's

454
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,599
measured in gdp

455
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,160
they do measure the illicit drug trade

456
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,438
they don't measure unpaid care

457
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,360
in gdp

458
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,440
but these countries decided wait a

459
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,719
second we're confusing activity with

460
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
results

461
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,558
the results of the economy should be the

462
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,640
well-being of its people would we not

463
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,480
agree that that's pretty basic but none

464
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,759
of us do it

465
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,240
i don't think it's um

466
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,160
a surprise that the three prime

467
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
ministers of these countries are women

468
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
they also happen to be crushing the the

469
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,798
coveted

470
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,558
response

471
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,798
the the death toll in these countries

472
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,558
has been very very low

473
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,558
because they're prioritizing well-being

474
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,798
nicholas sturgeon gave a viral ted talk

475
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,798
and she said you know what we choose to

476
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,480
measure as a country matters

477
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,798
because it drives political focus

478
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,839
politic public activity

479
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,519
and it in the end

480
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,240
if the activity of the economy is

481
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,519
killing the earth

482
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,679
oh well

483
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,918
we created more money

484
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,038
and she's saying look what we have to do

485
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,120
is we have to do better for our people

486
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,200
and the well-being is the measurement

487
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,959
that matters

488
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,000
so we're gonna take a poll here how many

489
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,919
of you know who robin hood is

490
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,240
oh this is one where almost all the

491
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,240
hands go up okay great so i have a

492
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
question for you we're gonna say

493
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,480
do you think robin hood is gaming or do

494
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,079
you think it's democratization

495
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,279
raise your hand if you think robin hood

496
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,119
is gaming

497
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,480
the investment system

498
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,798
and you know there's no right or wrong

499
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,319
answer because it's kind of both and how

500
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,119
many of you think robin hood is actually

501
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,798
democratizing investing

502
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,798
okay can we try this again because i'd

503
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,119
like to see all of your hands go up i

504
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,798
want to know one of the other

505
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,599
do you think that robin hood is

506
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,839
democratizing investment or do you think

507
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,439
that it's

508
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,639
teaching kids how to

509
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,038
gain their money so all in favor of its

510
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,038
gaming

511
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,399
a few of you all in favor of

512
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,919
democratization

513
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,880
okay i guess some of you are still

514
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,440
asleep um

515
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,960
robin hood has 20 million users and the

516
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
average user

517
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,160
has a 3 500 worth of assets under

518
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,600
management the biggest online trading

519
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,000
platform is e-trade they have 5.2

520
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,879
million users users with an average of

521
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,679
100 000 assets under management so

522
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,960
obviously e-trades doing 420 billion

523
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,880
dollars worth of trade that's just

524
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,640
retail whereas robinhood is doing about

525
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,960
80 billion

526
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,720
but what i will tell you is 20 million

527
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,240
people are involved in the trading

528
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,400
platform and how many of you saw what

529
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,319
they did to gamestop

530
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
what all these kids what my kids did to

531
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,200
gamestop because believe me my kids got

532
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,480
into that

533
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,120
they were re they were all about it

534
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,759
and what this generation is doing

535
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,000
while i was playing pac-man and cruising

536
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,679
that little main street that you saw my

537
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,839
kids are on their phone talking about

538
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,480
their cryptocurrency and they're talking

539
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,480
about oh should we get into the amc play

540
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,798
i would say that's democratization but

541
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,960
what's really interesting and what i sat

542
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,440
back in my minivan while they're in the

543
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,400
back talking and they're talking about

544
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,640
reddit and they're talking about twitter

545
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,360
and as a ceo of a public company and i'm

546
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,600
supposed to be running an irpr

547
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,319
uh campaign and i've got these big

548
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,519
companies like you know stockhouse and

549
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,839
um

550
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,839
you know the the places where you all go

551
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,119
to learn about stocks want me to write

552
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,240
25 000 a month checks to get my stock in

553
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,279
front of you

554
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,519
and what i realize is if i go on reddit

555
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,918
or if i go on twitter and these kids

556
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,440
start following me i might get 20

557
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,440
million kids

558
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,960
invested in my stock and believe me they

559
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
love cannabis

560
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,240
they're gamers

561
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,519
they're cannabis users and cannabis is

562
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,880
normal for them

563
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,119
so i'm thinking to myself i gotta engage

564
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,600
with these young people they are our

565
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,599
future

566
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,640
the median age

567
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,320
of our citizens on this planet right now

568
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,759
is

569
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:34,319
28.9 years old the median age that means

570
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,519
the majority of the people on this

571
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,439
planet

572
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,359
have cell phones

573
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,159
they get their information from

574
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,158
technology

575
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,360
this group of youth that are coming up

576
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,839
that we are now building an industry for

577
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,158
they have some expectations

578
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,480
they have watched us prioritize money

579
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
over everything they've watched us send

580
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
to

581
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,519
not us but two billionaires to the

582
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,919
space

583
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,079
we know what technology can bring us

584
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,480
imagine what would happen

585
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,359
if we prioritized as adults in this

586
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
world

587
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,359
the pursuit of well-being over the

588
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,479
pursuit of money what would we come up

589
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,038
with

590
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,640
because man we're capable of anything

591
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,359
and i'll tell you what the future what

592
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,759
these kids expect from us

593
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,439
and after watching gamestop

594
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,759
where they took a company that had no

595
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,558
fundamental value and they saved it and

596
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,720
then they crushed the capital markets

597
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,440
people that had put positions or that

598
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,038
were playing that short

599
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,400
they know how to do that and they did it

600
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,919
and what they're going to do

601
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,519
is they're going to figure out how to

602
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,360
talk on twitter and

603
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,879
reddit and twitter and they're going to

604
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,079
figure out how to get what they want out

605
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
of us

606
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,599
and i say why don't we just engage with

607
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,400
them why don't we join forces with the

608
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,918
youth here's what they want they get all

609
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
their information from their phones and

610
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,038
their computers and they have a

611
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,879
fundamental distrust of the government

612
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,240
what's the government doing for them

613
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,360
what's the government doing for any of

614
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,960
us really

615
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,439
and i'm curious to see how they're going

616
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,679
to hack the government because i i don't

617
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,759
mean like literally hack it but how are

618
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
they going to make things happen the way

619
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,000
they want them and what they're doing is

620
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,079
cancel culture

621
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,759
if you know if they don't like you or if

622
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,678
you are not authentic or you are not

623
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,879
telling the truth they will out you and

624
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,480
you will be done

625
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,640
so how about we start listening to them

626
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,798
and start telling the truth start being

627
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
authentic and start prioritizing

628
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,558
well-being of

629
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,038
the humanity and the planet

630
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,119
and we are we are in the right industry

631
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,240
for this because we are operating in

632
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,158
prohibition we can make this world look

633
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,558
any way we want

634
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,760
we can do things like

635
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,000
demand that the stock exchanges require

636
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,400
women and people of color be on boards

637
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,679
and young people for example we can

638
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,440
require that in one swoop of a pen

639
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,120
we could change the way the world works

640
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,038
authenticity

641
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,199
my kids have been marketed to since they

642
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,599
were born think about

643
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,759
when they get on a program and they see

644
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,278
somebody put product placement they know

645
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,278
they're getting paid for that what they

646
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,278
want is to hear the truth they want to

647
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,440
follow interesting people and they want

648
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,440
to follow authentic people so if you've

649
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,360
got a brand or you've got a company out

650
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,759
there make sure that you're

651
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,000
communicating to the world in a way

652
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,960
that's very authentic

653
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,519
you'll make it if you are they want us

654
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,440
to be planet friendly

655
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,519
they're watching us and they want to

656
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,240
know what the impact on the earth is of

657
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,558
our products the good news is if we're

658
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,038
in cannabis if we're not trying to grow

659
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,319
cannabis in cold climates which i think

660
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,000
is weird

661
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:54,240
you know you don't grow corn in

662
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,640
warehouses in canada to make candy right

663
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,038
the sun is going to be the way we make

664
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
cannabis and once that becomes the norm

665
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,359
because most of the cannabis

666
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,640
that is being sold in america right now

667
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,079
what's really hot is all the

668
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,520
concentrates

669
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,000
well it doesn't matter what the cannabis

670
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,158
looks like and ultimately fluffy buds

671
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,400
are the better ones anyway but they want

672
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,159
to know what is your impact on the world

673
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,880
and they want to know are you being

674
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,039
innovative are you up cycling they don't

675
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,360
want to see the landfills filled with

676
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,879
plastics anymore they want to they don't

677
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,119
want to see the oceans filled with

678
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,240
plastics anymore and we shouldn't be

679
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,719
doing that anymore so i honestly as a

680
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,640
ceo of bang i do things like

681
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,880
i have people of color on my board i

682
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,000
have gay people on my board my executive

683
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,640
team is diverse we only use sustainable

684
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,960
packaging we're making decisions because

685
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,480
i feel like knowing this and that this

686
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
is the people that are coming up to buy

687
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,159
my products it's malpractice when i

688
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,320
don't do it because i'm putting my

689
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,480
company at risk because of people coming

690
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,079
into the cannabis industry that are

691
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,919
going to be buying our products they

692
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:02,558
care about this stuff and we should too

693
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,120
so i have been asked that's me up in the

694
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,839
top right there um i'm part of this

695
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,439
group of women ceos in cannabis and we

696
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,038
call ourselves jokingly the female

697
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,880
cannabis mafia

698
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,759
and kirsten gillibrand is a friend of

699
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,159
one of our our cohort members and so she

700
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,319
calls us we have a call and they ask us

701
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,120
to give them advice about how to make

702
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,599
this legalization happen the democrats

703
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,359
really believe that cannabis legislation

704
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,199
is going to be groundbreaking for a

705
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,839
couple of reasons one is the way

706
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,519
politics normally works is monopoly

707
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,839
money oh we got this big budget over

708
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,599
here for military let's steal some of

709
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,480
that budget and put it over here for

710
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,918
education

711
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,240
and then the republicans come in and

712
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,278
they give the money back to military

713
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,200
right cannabis is a new bucket of money

714
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,519
and we can pull it out of the illicit

715
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,840
market and put it into the economy here

716
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,400
i am talking about money but we can do

717
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,158
it in a way that's responsible so i'm

718
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,840
telling senator gillibrand you know what

719
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,120
i think you guys should be doing you

720
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,119
should be talking to young people

721
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,319
don't underestimate them

722
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,559
this one says hi mom and dad they're

723
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,798
forcing me to write but they can't make

724
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,240
me tell you anything this is a little

725
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,359
girl writing from

726
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,400
from camp

727
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,839
this is the mentality of our youth

728
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,640
they are not to be

729
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:25,199
underestimated so here's my

730
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,200
calls to action for the germans in the

731
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,399
room for the europeans and for everybody

732
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,798
in cannabis

733
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,278
number one let's change the narrative

734
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,599
from money to well-being

735
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,519
let's talk about and if you can't stop

736
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,519
talking about money that's fine but add

737
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,759
well-being to your repertoire

738
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:42,798
cannabis makes people feel better second

739
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,839
of all

740
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,079
when somebody is spouting

741
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,519
fat things that are not facts oh it's a

742
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,359
gateway drug oh people get psychosis all

743
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,798
of the things that we know are not true

744
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,639
and you sit there and bite your tongue

745
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,839
don't bite your tongue

746
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,480
challenge these inaccurate narratives

747
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:07,119
and these untested assumptions

748
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,120
be brave in public be bold be courageous

749
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,959
and here's the one thing i want to say

750
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,158
to the germans you all know who our

751
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,159
brands are

752
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,880

753
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,039
