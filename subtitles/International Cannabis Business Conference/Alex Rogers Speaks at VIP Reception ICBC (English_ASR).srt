come on

60
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,549
nicest company the wealthiest company

61
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:20,510
and the most beautiful company of all

62
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:21,640
and that's good but what we do is making

63
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:24,649
it a little bit

64
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,108
United stands as he said we are the

65
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,230
cannabis industry we need proper

66
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:31,909
regulations we see here the German

67
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:34,429
government doesn't get it done to give

68
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:36,318
out licenses to could use cannabis in a

69
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,959
fair way at the moment is completely

70
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,238
trashed and in that situation you can

71
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,408
have the best company of all but you own

72
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:49,128
it anywhere we'll bet government what we

73
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:52,429
do is take a tiny proportion of big

74
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:54,318
money you let us do that by fight for

75
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,718
cocoa regulations for everybody for

76
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,818
patients for consumers and for the

77
00:03:56,718 --> 00:04:01,729
business and then we make the best one

78
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:04,578
begin and with the waste then it's all

79
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,099
