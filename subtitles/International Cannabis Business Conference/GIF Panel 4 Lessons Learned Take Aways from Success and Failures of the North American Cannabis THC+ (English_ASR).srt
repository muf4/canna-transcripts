thank you David so I've been in the

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,859
Cannabis industry for eight years

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,719
focused in the United States I was a

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,119
managing director at a private Equity

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,640
Fund called MacArthur Capital we were

22
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:01,320
involved in different M A's for the past

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,780
year the past eight years we've seen the

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,180
highs and the lows and and it's it's a

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,700
very intriguing Market to now be in

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,200
Europe we are headquartered in

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,939
Switzerland we are a vertically

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,280
integrated pharmaceutical cannabis

29
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,039
company that primarily focuses on

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,920
genetics and Manufacturing as well as

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,640
Trading so import export

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,640
thank you

33
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,359
hello

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,060
um I started Distributing Medical and

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,099
Abyss to patients 27 years ago

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,740
so I was the first medical cannabis

37
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,658
distributor in Canada just after the

38
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,399
operations in California started I

39
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,920
started delivering cannabis with a

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,799
bicycle and a pager and a backpack it

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,280
was even before the days of flip phones

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,500
we essentially built a movement in

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,659
Canada focused on patient advocacy

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,118
physician education working with our

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,579
Regulators working with the public and

46
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,560
transformed Canada's perception of

47
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,359
cannabis we dragged our government

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,600
Kicking and Screaming through the courts

49
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,420
until we created a federal framework for

50
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,299
medical cannabis when the first 12 large

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,459
licenses were given out I moved from my

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,800
civilly disobedient activist Queen of

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,120
the rebels role and started working in

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,000
the corporate world I started working

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,459
with bedrocan and eventually became the

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,759
first female member of the c-suite of

57
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,459
canopy growth you know canopy growth has

58
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,299
since somewhat gone through a bit of a

59
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,819
decline so I have lived through the

60
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,920
Revolution and the legalization and the

61
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:37,199
ups and downs and now Canada is very

62
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,579
much in a market Recovery Place and I

63
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,759
look forward to sharing some insights

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,879
about that experience with you

65
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,219
thanks Hillary uh Louis Koski I've been

66
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:51,060
involved in the Cannabis industry since

67
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,580
uh roughly 2009 full-time uh did some

68
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,979
work in it prior to that almost entirely

69
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,959
on the government side of the equation

70
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,018
so I bring that government perspective

71
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,939
probably most notably I was the director

72
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,180
of the Colorado marijuana enforcement

73
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:08,098
division in

74
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,019
2013 going into 2014 when we first

75
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,119
legalized cannabis there so I was

76
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,700
largely responsible for leading the

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,340
teams that drafted the first several

78
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,579
rounds of regulations is also a subject

79
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,620
matter expert to our legislatures our to

80
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,420
our to the state legislature where we

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,700
kind of reported uh how we were

82
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,579
progressing with our implementation

83
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:32,579
since that time I have had a small

84
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,940
consulting firm that or had me traveling

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,280
around the US and Canada sometimes here

86
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,500
in Europe in the Caribbean helping

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,900
governments kind of grapple with more

88
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,080
permissive cannabis policy see they

89
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,000
helped design that for them and then I

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,980
started with metric which is a leading

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,199
seed to sale tracking software company

92
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,899
that contracts with 23 different

93
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:58,199
government agencies to provide track and

94
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,480
Trade Services for government and

95
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,018
Industry to create transparent Supply

96
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,018
chains

97
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:10,139
hello my name is Steve winiker I'm based

98
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,340
in Toronto I work at Canon Court genuity

99
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,399
I'm a managing director of the

100
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,500
investment banking group canacord is a

101
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,100
medium-sized Global Investment Bank I

102
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,379
lead the um the uh the Cannabis practice

103
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,060
globally I started raising money for

104
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,959
North America Canadian cannabis

105
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,079
companies in 2018 and 2019 I started

106
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:34,620
raising money for U.S companies since

107
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,779
then our practice has raised uh about

108
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,459
seven billion dollars for cannabis

109
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,859
companies in North America and we've

110
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,258
advised on about 20 billion dollars of M

111
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,780
A transactions so we have a a pretty

112
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,220
good track record most of that happened

113
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:48,599
prior to the last 12 months as a matter

114
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,699
of fact all of it happened probably the

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,300
last 12 months it's been quiet the last

116
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,300
12 months

117
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not

118
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,299
thanks Steve so if you look at the the

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,500
title of this uh

120
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,000
section that we're talking about and if

121
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,839
you're here when I kick things off this

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
morning

123
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,399
we like to we're trying to look and

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,019
change the nomenclature THC plus THC

125
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,478
minus otherwise known as marijuana

126
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:18,180
versus hemp so certainly we can cover

127
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:21,060
both of those uh not just the marijuana

128
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,100
side as far as Lessons Learned From the

129
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,019
U.S but I think what we want to do is

130
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,879
again this is not a moderated panel we

131
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,319
want to kick it off with one question

132
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,240
we'll go through that and we can

133
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,339
certainly kick it to the audience to go

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,340
to questions to you guys make it more

135
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:37,138
interactive so Peter's starting off uh

136
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,179
what do you think are that the three

137
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,038
Lessons Learned again whether you want

138
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,500
to talk of the framework on the THC plus

139
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,360
THC minus side from what you learn the

140
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,800
three things from North America weather

141
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,600
is Canada U.S

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
well since we're going to open it up I'm

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,860
going to keep it high level but I think

144
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,400
that being involved in building a good

145
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,020
regulatory platform is is um is one of

146
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,638
the best opportunities that a lot of

147
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:04,038
these Global markets have it's something

148
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:07,319
that in the U.S just in in many states

149
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:09,120
absolutely I mean they did not support

150
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,439
the businesses that were that were

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,259
building

152
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,439
um I would say that the early stage

153
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:19,680
valuation of a lot of these companies

154
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,600
were way too high I think that these

155
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
companies were focusing on what the

156
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,180
potential Market was not understanding

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,680
the Dynamics of how the product was

158
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,740
ultimately going to get to the end user

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,800
whether it's a patient or a consumer so

160
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,720
over built

161
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,000
platforms over value overvalued

162
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,160
companies

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,620
um I'll stick with those two for now

164
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,660
thanks Peter Hillary

165
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,819
how many minutes can I take you want all

166
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:52,860
three all in one go yeah well you know

167
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:55,620
it's uh yeah not 30 minutes okay

168
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,479
um okay so first of all in Canada we

169
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,120
legalized cannabis with a probationist

170
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,918
mentality so in order to sell

171
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,500
legalization to the conservative Law and

172
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,779
Order parts of our government we had to

173
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,360
basically legalize cannabis with the

174
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,000
purpose to reduce the harms of cannabis

175
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,100
my government didn't go so far is to say

176
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,199
let's actually in the legislation

177
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,660
acknowledge the racist history of

178
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,419
cannabis let's actually look at the

179
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,460
policies that America exported around

180
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:25,680
the world and let's deal with correcting

181
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:29,038
that from a legislative perspective

182
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,918
and what happened is the stigma that is

183
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,318
based in racism from 100 years of

184
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,198
Prohibition carried through and

185
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,139
permeates our regulatory framework so

186
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,960
cannabis is still treated with way more

187
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,639
stigma than any other industry it's more

188
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,399
highly regulated in many ways than

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,860
alcohol and tobacco are it's overtaxed

190
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,379
it's over regulated and my industry in

191
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,740
Canada is being strangled I spent the LA

192
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:57,959
my entire adult life working to create a

193
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,360
regulatory framework for medical and

194
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,159
recreational cannabis in Canada and

195
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,120
currently the industry is pretty much

196
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,520
devastated in Canada because of the

197
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,918
stigma that permeates the regulatory

198
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,859
framework and in Europe I'm not hearing

199
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,740
any conversations about unpacking the

200
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,379
history of prohibition and ensuring that

201
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,780
we actually create legislation that

202
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,120
addresses the history so that we're not

203
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:28,038
over regulating over taxing and

204
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,038
basically killing the industry

205
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,038
okay so the second issue is what I'm

206
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,839
seeing in North America and starting to

207
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,519
see around the world is that we're

208
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,860
treating cannabis and cannabis companies

209
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,899
like other any other cpg product

210
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,940
cannabis is not a product that you

211
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,278
simply manufacture and sell to a

212
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,320
consumer moving cannabis from an

213
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:56,639
unregulated Market into a regulated

214
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,660
market is a massive social shift I'm no

215
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,220
longer really seeing companies invest in

216
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,980
patient education some physician

217
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,060
education still

218
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,399
ensuring that companies are actually

219
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,278
diverse ensuring that there's actually

220
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,379
Community impact social justice work all

221
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,379
of the pieces that actually make your

222
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,958
employers your employees your consumers

223
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:22,439
and your Regulators actually have

224
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,799
loyalty to you and your company

225
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,519
that's number two ready okay so the

226
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,439
third piece let me check my glasses is

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,659
again you talked about

228
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
um Fair evaluations right and I want to

229
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,620
talk a little bit about Market

230
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,539
projections so my government projected

231
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,519
that the recreational and medical

232
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:45,719
cannabis Market was going to be about 12

233
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,519
billion and it's actually four so it's

234
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,080
much much much smaller than what was

235
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,179
predicted

236
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,220
um companies we were over invested in

237
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,679
there was like investment was falling

238
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,839
out of the sky my well my previous

239
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,359
company took in five billion dollars

240
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,279
from constellation Brands there's just

241
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,019
the the SK the the pace of scaling was

242
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,419
absolutely ridiculous so over over

243
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,519
investment over capacity build and now

244
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:13,379
we have millions of grams of unsold

245
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,080
cannabis in the market because

246
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,659
everything just grew absolutely way too

247
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,100
fast the survivors the people who are

248
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,600
actually starting to be profitable

249
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,879
they're not vertically integrated

250
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,500
they're special realizing they're

251
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,778
smaller they're keeping their overhead

252
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,600
lower and they're actually able to Pivot

253
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:33,179
quickly to meet the needs of the

254
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,060
patients and the recreational consumers

255
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:38,579
thanks Hillary very good Louis

256
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,659
that's really good no there's three I

257
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,519
don't know if I'm that structured on

258
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,620
mine but I the one thing I'm like taking

259
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,600
away from what I've heard so far and

260
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,459
kind of like play like can like speaks

261
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,278
to our thinking on this is the

262
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:52,078
legalization of cannabis is one hell of

263
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,259
a balancing act

264
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,299
um I I on one hand I think the

265
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,939
governance of legalization is really

266
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:03,000
important so you but but it but having

267
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,519
like too little governance or too little

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,259
government interaction isn't great but

269
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,879
having too much government action is

270
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,399
also like can can tend to be pretty

271
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,500
stifling and take away from uh how big

272
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,240
the market can be and how effective

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,100
businesses are

274
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,899
um so when you think of it in terms of a

275
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,879
balancing act like one thing that's

276
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,159
important is like getting like getting

277
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,919
government or having government engaged

278
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,360
in a way that is actually supportive of

279
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,399
the industry and I think to a large

280
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,980
extent you know what Hillary was saying

281
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,259
is is spot on and that we we tend to

282
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,000
think of this as like like bringing an

283
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,379
illicit Market into a regulated market

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,379
it so we have to be really kind of

285
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,600
heavy-handed with the regulation when in

286
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,399
reality what's really important is once

287
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,139
the decision is made to legalize

288
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,899
cannabis is for government to actually

289
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,120
really engage and collaborate with the

290
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,679
industry to come up with the right

291
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,320
regulations because part of The

292
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,439
Balancing Act is finding regulations

293
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,240
that really genuinely help protect

294
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,000
Public Health in a way that the illicit

295
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,579
Market doesn't but also try and

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,320
right-size those to where investment is

297
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:08,699
possible and that is possible for

298
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,040
businesses to grow and I think it's

299
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,560
really hard for a lot of people to

300
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,599
really get their head wrapped around an

301
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,159
industry that should be designed in such

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,019
a way where the businesses can actually

303
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,219
be successful and so I think I think

304
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,860
that's really important and then when

305
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,379
you have the the government like right

306
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,680
sizing the regulations for business then

307
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,480
businesses are actually like more likely

308
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,838
to be super supportive of government so

309
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,399
instead of like the normal regulatory

310
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,320
dynamic or there's this adversarial

311
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,179
relationship between the regulator and

312
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,360
the regulated Community you can actually

313
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:43,679
tend to like partner a little bit more

314
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,800
and collaborate a little bit more in a

315
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,899
way where products can be safer but

316
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,599
businesses is can be successful and then

317
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,740
I think the third lesson that that we've

318
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,778
learned kind of like on the positive

319
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,579
side is that once you have that that

320
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:00,899
partnership built up and you have some

321
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:02,699
trust between those two entities then it

322
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,919
makes it a lot easier to create the the

323
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,440
transparency that's necessary for

324
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,539
government to be able to efficiently

325
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,220
oversee what's happening in the industry

326
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,319
without like again a continually

327
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,300
burdening the businesses with reporting

328
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,079
requirements and

329
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:21,778
um uh um other like uh uh like uh super

330
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:24,359
complicated testing regimes and labeling

331
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:27,299
Pro of products Etc you can really start

332
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,220
to balance that in a way that that is is

333
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,620
beneficial both again to public health

334
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,778
and safety but the of sustainability of

335
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,839
the businesses over the Long Haul

336
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:38,399
Steve sure so I think it's over

337
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,620
regulation and under regulation

338
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,679
happening at the same time in the same

339
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,899
Market which has been the the curse of a

340
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,699
Canadian and and U.S businesses and I'll

341
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,500
give you a couple of examples so in

342
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,259
Canada

343
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,259
um they're they're at the peak there

344
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:58,259
were 1200 I think 1200 actual licensed

345
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:01,679
producers in Canada 1200 for a market

346
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:03,838
size of four billion dollars uh anybody

347
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,819
who paid five in the province where I'm

348
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,740
from Ontario anyone who paid five

349
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,139
thousand dollars could open a dispensary

350
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,240
so to at the peak there were I think

351
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,919
1400 dispensaries in the province of

352
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,639
Ontario there's eight million people in

353
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,740
that Province the one of the largest

354
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,720
dispensary networks in the country as a

355
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,320
company called fire and flower declared

356
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,560
bankruptcy a couple weeks ago uh the

357
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,180
biggest dispensary Network in Canada a

358
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,799
company called the high tide I think

359
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,359
they they do about half a billion

360
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,319
dollars a year in revenue and they have

361
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,240
yet to to make a profit so I think you

362
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,699
know on the one hand the the there's

363
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,740
there's an under regulation in the

364
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:47,099
government in that instance the over

365
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,560
regulation I would point to taxes uh

366
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,959
particularly in the United States right

367
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,299
now the uh the the the effective tax

368
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,578
rate marginal tax rate for U.S licensed

369
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,799
producer U.S multi-state operators about

370
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,138
78 76 percent

371
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,419
so how do you have a business that does

372
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,120
a billion to in revenue and forty

373
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:08,099
percent even down margins but has zero

374
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,440
free cash flow

375
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,420
um I think until some of these kind of

376
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,399
Institutions so that's that's the over

377
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:17,759
regulation in Canada the same thing with

378
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,620
excise taxes with with uh no uh

379
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,620
transferring across some across

380
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,778
provincial inability to transfer across

381
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,399
provincial lines

382
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,198
um you have an inability for the

383
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,940
Canadian licensed producers to make any

384
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,039
money out of the four billion dollar

385
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,959
market I think there's only the maximum

386
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,120
market share that any one large license

387
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:38,278
producer in Canada has is five percent I

388
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,039
think it was canopy for a little while

389
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,899
so you have 1200 licensed producers

390
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,419
maximum market share is five percent

391
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,220
seventy eight percent uh tax rate

392
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:51,120
effective tax rate in the United States

393
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,100
that because of both under uh under

394
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,019
regulation over regulation it's

395
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,079
impossible to make a commercial entity

396
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,578
firm for for for any cannabis producer

397
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,239
in North America yeah

398
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:04,739
thank you Steve uh so uh as I mentioned

399
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,240
before starting off I want to take this

400
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,060
in two parts first of all talking about

401
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,339
THC plus so as I mentioned I was in

402
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,799
Davos in 2020 before the pandemic shut

403
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,660
things down and in Davos I wanted to

404
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,259
pull three things that I thought we'd

405
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,519
learned in North America and the U.S

406
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,439
that were applicable and going to be

407
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,839
applicable to Europe and frankly I think

408
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,300
they still hold one is there's been very

409
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,860
little history first mover advantage in

410
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:31,259
this industry as I mentioned I was Chief

411
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,659
business officer Cerna CERN was the

412
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:36,000
biggest name in cannabis Full Stop in

413
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,240
2014. nobody knows who they are now

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,679
right timing

415
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,839
geographies always roll out not always

416
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,659
pretty darn sure most of the time roll

417
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,660
out much slower than you know if you

418
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,919
look at Spain UK

419
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:52,860
Nevada actually rolled out quickly

420
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,838
Colorado did uh you know but very few

421
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,240
times look at Germany right look at

422
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,519
Portugal everything's been slow the

423
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,740
third thing on the THC plus side is that

424
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,019
fact and you guys may remember hearing

425
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,359
it earlier biological Supply chains are

426
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:09,480
inherently unstable and whether it's

427
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,279
canopy growth Aurora Harvest you name it

428
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,019
pretty much and that's the thing that's

429
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,720
been an advantage for us is having a

430
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,519
biological biotech background when all

431
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,980
these operators are going from 40 000

432
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,480
square feet of grow to 400 000 we

433
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,000
predicted that it was going to blow up

434
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,699
and it did right so let's get to THC

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,919
minus or whether otherwise known as hemp

436
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,620
the problem with that in part of the

437
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,500
sector was the fact that there was very

438
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:36,058
low bearish to entry so and especially

439
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,700
you saw this in the U.S you had a lot of

440
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:40,500
people jumping in because there's no

441
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,380
real regulation or anything else like

442
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,240
there was on the THC plus side and then

443
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,600
you as a result had a lot of products

444
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,640
that were low quality and that result in

445
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,678
low barriers low quality resulted in a

446
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,640
ton of noise in the market so as a

447
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,620
result you had a lot of people patients

448
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,500
buying CBD or whatever the product was

449
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:04,439
mainly CBD and taking it and it doesn't

450
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,480
didn't work right so then you have this

451
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,860
mass of people saying hey this is great

452
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,240
stuff when it works for them and other

453
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,279
people trying bad products and it

454
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,839
wouldn't work so so that was the three

455
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,700
things we learned on the hemp side of

456
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,759
the THC minus but Peter did you have a

457
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,440
comment well I I just want to you know

458
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,480
the the net net is that the illicit

459
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,019
Market is a competitor until this is

460
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,538
properly regulated so it's um you know

461
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,400
you look at Oklahoma which is sure it is

462
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,679
regulated but it's under regulated and

463
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,720
they have over 10 000 licenses that

464
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,120
supports the black market or I'm the

465
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,200
illicit market right so I just think

466
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,199
it's important when you think about

467
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,779
regulation too much too little I I agree

468
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,960
with what the what the entire panelists

469
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:48,480
have said on on that topic thanks and

470
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,980
okay yeah first question from the panel

471
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,660
so far

472
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,819
um

473
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,080
I think you all make good points I think

474
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:57,058
I think some of the challenge with

475
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,980
cannabis is that yep is that uh

476
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:01,079
Regulators want to treat it like it's

477
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,120
yellow cake uranium and not just a weed

478
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,619
plant uh and so they tend to go

479
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,599
overboard

480
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:10,079
um also I think one of the challenges

481
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:13,319
too is cannabis has been maybe the most

482
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,058
successful decentralized business in the

483
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,139
world right because of prohibition

484
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:18,178
nobody

485
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,740
ever wanted to get too big because

486
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,900
that's when the the government will come

487
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,700
after you and so there were a lot of

488
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,440
small farmers who were making a good

489
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,360
wage and making good money and able to

490
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,519
pay their trimmers and able to go to

491
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,000
Thailand uh in the winter after the

492
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,918
Harvest was done uh but now we see in

493
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,538
these forums and and all this investment

494
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,720
everybody wants to monopolize everybody

495
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:41,879
wants to have 30 of the market share and

496
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,919
I think that that people are really

497
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,080
um

498
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,759
overestimating maybe perhaps or just in

499
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,480
their desire to be

500
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,220
super capitalistic are are missing out

501
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,140
on on how the actual

502
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,339
the consumers and the business and the

503
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,900
things work you understand what I mean

504
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:59,279
can I build on that quickly would you

505
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,080
please I know we're about to take a

506
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,220
question from the audience I want to say

507
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,319
that it's all of our Collective

508
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,058
responsibility to build this industry

509
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,859
and to build the market and I hear a lot

510
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,960
of projections I heard some crazy

511
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,639
numbers last night about how big the

512
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,440
German patient Market is going to be in

513
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,780
a year I don't hear anybody talking

514
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,820
about the Investments that they're

515
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:19,558
making that are going to support the

516
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:21,720
whole space and not just support their

517
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:22,980
one company like I'm curious of all of

518
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,319
the people that are here that are

519
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,819
interested in the European market how

520
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,379
many of you can have contributed to the

521
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:30,240
European medical cannabis Association

522
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,919
how many of you are supporting the

523
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,900
industry associations that are doing the

524
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,820
work on behalf of the entire industry

525
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,740
the other thing that I haven't heard a

526
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:40,500
lot about is about patient affordability

527
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,058
and if you want to grow a medical market

528
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,679
and you're actually dealing with

529
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:45,359
critically and chronically ill patients

530
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,700
you're dealing with some of the less

531
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,319
privileged people in your population so

532
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,240
I hear a lot about market share and I

533
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,480
hear a lot about margins but I don't

534
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,679
hear a lot about actually create

535
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,480
distribution structures and Supply

536
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,880
chains that are actually making the

537
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,710
product performance and that's what's

538
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,140
going to grow your Market

539
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,579
[Applause]

540
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,640
hey everyone

541
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:10,859
um thanks for a great uh perspective I

542
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,538
was curious are there particular markets

543
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,699
in the United States that you guys think

544
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,558
have done a better job at avoiding some

545
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,960
of the pitfalls you've discussed such as

546
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,000
high taxes and a persistent illicit

547
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,140
Market I can think of a few but I'm

548
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,839
curious if there's any that have caught

549
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,000
your attention and also I'm curious if

550
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,399
you have a take on what can be done to

551
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,839
ensure these that these uh policy

552
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,880
lessons are learned I think there's the

553
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:34,740
perception in the United States that we

554
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
fail to learn from our prior mistakes

555
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,819
and I'm curious if you guys agree if you

556
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,140
and if you have a reason as to why that

557
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,139
happens and how it can be addressed

558
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,798
I like Oregon

559
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,440
grows great weed and it's very cheap

560
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,700
it's not maybe so much for the farmers

561
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,919
now because they don't get the prices

562
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,740
they used to but in terms of getting rid

563
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,440
of the illicit Market when you can buy a

564
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,460
half a kilo of very good Oregon cannabis

565
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,159
for

566
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,798
50 Euro 40 Euro or whatever it's crazy

567
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,000
their prices are ridiculous

568
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,679
um and I think they've done a pretty

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,359
good job with it don't get me started

570
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,159
about Washington or California though I

571
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,379
got problems with those people well well

572
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,900
or I just I do want to stay Oregon have

573
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,820
the largest price compression in in U.S

574
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,480
history so it was a very difficult

575
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:23,579
market for the farmers to survive

576
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,759
um right now my favorite Market is

577
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:29,279
Missouri it's um you are on a state

578
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,980
level you can you can write off 280e

579
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,658
obviously not on a federal level this is

580
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,880
a major topic that everyone is talking

581
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:39,780
about the United States so to see States

582
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:43,500
override federal law or tax structures

583
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:46,019
is is is progress it's progress that the

584
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,619
the states have to take and and drive

585
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:52,259
forward they also have just generally

586
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,359
the lowest tax bracket in in the United

587
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,819
States so Missouri is my favorite Market

588
00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:00,719
I think it hers it depends on what your

589
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:03,058
uh per I think Benedict or maybe he was

590
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,779
uh Constantine said your definition of

591
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:08,220
success and for example uh Oklahoma I

592
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,079
mean come on talk about success it's

593
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,000
Medical Market 800 million dollars

594
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,939
second year most of that's going to

595
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,319
Dallas Texas right so it's it's a you

596
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,798
know it's been very vibrant I would

597
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,720
think also uh Lewis with you on stage I

598
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,759
think Colorado definitely did a pretty

599
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,259
good job being the first roll out State

600
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,700
although they kind of screwed things up

601
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:28,798
on the public side but I don't know

602
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,960
Lewis could have a better perspective on

603
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,700
that than me yeah so since we uh

604
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,079
contract with 22 different states in the

605
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,120
U.S I'm a little reluctant to start

606
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,158
calling out like the ones that are my

607
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,739
favorites obviously I've got a lot

608
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,780
invested into uh to Colorado's Market

609
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,099
because that's where I kind of got my

610
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:45,298
start and

611
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,619
um you know well I think there was a lot

612
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,599
of things that went really well in

613
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,459
Colorado to begin with but I think kind

614
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,459
of like served as a launch pad for other

615
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,779
states to to kind of follow suit

616
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,640
um you know I think there's like some

617
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,740
pluses and minuses to a lot of different

618
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,559
approaches and I mentioned earlier about

619
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,720
like the importance of governance

620
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,178
um you know I I think where we've seen

621
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,779
the like most success is When government

622
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,640
is proactive in taking some level of

623
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,980
charge so like if you think about the

624
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,780
differences between like Washington and

625
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,298
Oregon and California and Massachusetts

626
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,980
and Colorado and Michigan they've all

627
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,139
kind of like taken different approaches

628
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,298
and at different times during the

629
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,659
history they've like been like more or

630
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:30,119
less proactive in how they're um how

631
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,799
they're they're uh acting as a

632
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,319
government and so

633
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:38,038
um we've seen like where government is

634
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,839
like either like being apathetic and not

635
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,859
doing anything we've seen like the

636
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,959
growth of illicit markets we've seen a

637
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,819
lot of criminal activity and we've just

638
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,860
seen like a lot of like uncertainty in

639
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,319
the market whereas on the opposite of

640
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:54,479
the spectrum where government has been

641
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,000
more proactive and collaborating and

642
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,038
partnering with industry we've seen you

643
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,200
know much more positive results in terms

644
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,558
of the the perception that people have

645
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,259
about The credibility of the market

646
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,418
we'll give the uh I think capitalist Pig

647
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:12,619
answer to this question I like the

648
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:15,299
limited license vertical markets because

649
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:17,459
it's the one that uh it's still true

650
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:18,200
it's the one that it's the one that you

651
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,460
can

652
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,679
get significant amount of market share

653
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,900
you can manage your margins and to the

654
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,759
extent you can do something with your

655
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,080
profitability given the tax regime those

656
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,759
other markets that you can have the most

657
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,158
impact can I ask you a question though

658
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,480
because sometimes

659
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,360
and I understand the vertical Market

660
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,919
idea but a lot of times you you try the

661
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,379
Cannabis from those cats and it just

662
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,360
tastes like commercial pressure like you

663
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,460
have to get it out in eight weeks like

664
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,379
you don't have time to you in California

665
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,720
now it's hard to find a good 12-week

666
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,039
sativa in the dispensaries and some of

667
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,360
the really nice old school strains

668
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,519
everything is growing so fast everything

669
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,278
is cured so quickly everything has to be

670
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,079
gotten out right away and I feel some of

671
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:59,880
the challenges with with a vertical

672
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,678
approach uh as opposed to maybe a

673
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,120
crafter or a smaller approach is that

674
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,700
you don't get the quality I mean

675
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,019
Budweiser is cool but you know I like a

676
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,440
craft beer

677
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:12,119
you might be right I don't have no other

678
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,400
answer me on saying you might be right

679
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,658
the quality might suffer but again I'm

680
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,919
looking at it through the prism of the

681
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,419
capital markets and from that

682
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,759
perspective

683
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,640
you know maybe the quality isn't as good

684
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:26,000
as oftentimes as a craft grower or a

685
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,340
more wide open market but

686
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,798
you can make more money well also to add

687
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:34,079
to that Steve I the the one thing that's

688
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,879
important too is not not being in

689
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,819
Limitless and State versus Limitless

690
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,900
licensed state right so I uh you know

691
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:41,819
we've been telling them forever if

692
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,740
you're in Colorado or California I'll

693
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:45,298
put those operators against anybody any

694
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,240
day if you can win in The Crucible

695
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:51,058
competition Colorado uh you're going to

696
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,179
be the next question

697
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:56,460
so I'm hi my name is uh Trenton Birch I

698
00:26:54,179 --> 00:27:00,120
come from South Africa I'm interested to

699
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,700
know what the the sort of narrative or

700
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,979
view is in the states at the moment in

701
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,659
terms of I think we often forget and I

702
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,240
appreciate this as an investment Forum

703
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:11,520
where returns are are the most important

704
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:16,259
sort of conversation but I think we've

705
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:20,819
also lost focus on on the on what

706
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:22,619
cannabis and hemp can do for our planet

707
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:24,658
from a medical perspective from a

708
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:27,298
sustainability perspective you know

709
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,860
investing in in this industry is good

710
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:31,798
for business and it's good for the

711
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:34,139
planet and I feel like we've we've we've

712
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:36,179
raced so far forward at such a rapid

713
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,038
speed we've seen this happen over

714
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,320
capitalization especially on cultivation

715
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,720
a lot of people have lost money but is

716
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,359
there any narrative in the US at the

717
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,339
moment around people investing in this

718
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,519
industry because it's good for human

719
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:53,519
human race and and actually surviving

720
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,440
and and if and if not why not because it

721
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,319
it's it's a good narrative in terms of

722
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,298
you know sustainability is definitely a

723
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,859
a place where money can be made so if

724
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:04,379
people adjusting it to make money that's

725
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:06,778
also fine but have we lost our way in

726
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,299
terms of the importance of cannabis and

727
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:11,419
hemp for the future of our planet you

728
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:11,418
know

729
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:16,980
I don't have your I don't have an answer

730
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:19,440
about uh whether people are investing in

731
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,079
cannabis for those reasons in the U.S

732
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,360
um but I do want to raise that like for

733
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,579
me personally working to free cannabis

734
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,259
from the chains of prohibition a huge

735
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,178
part of it is about the potential that

736
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,720
cannabis has to actually address climate

737
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:35,640
change and speaking of sustainability

738
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,159
I'm curious how many of you maybe you

739
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,440
can show me a raise of hands know about

740
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,720
the legislation that the EU enacted into

741
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,240
law in April that is the corporate

742
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,400
sustainability reporting standards that

743
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,259
are going to impact cannabis companies

744
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,298
operating in Europe

745
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:52,740
yeah so a few of you do so this is

746
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:54,599
really something that's important to

747
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,880
like look around the corner and see what

748
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,439
is coming because for publicly traded

749
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,600
companies the reporting is going to

750
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,460
start at the beginning of next year and

751
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,740
for small and medium-sized Enterprises

752
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,538
you have about two years to get ready so

753
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,298
how many of you are familiar with what

754
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:11,700
scope one two and three is when it comes

755
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:14,460
to your environmental impact disclosures

756
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,220
so scope one and scope two is about

757
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,980
measuring and Reporting on your own

758
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,798
emissions so this is carbon it's also

759
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,259
waste and water but scope three which

760
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,940
the EU is going to be requiring is

761
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,679
actually about reporting on the

762
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,778
environmental footprint of your supply

763
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,360
chain so this is something that's

764
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:35,579
incredibly important to start preparing

765
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,798
for because if you're not building your

766
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:40,259
companies with the data systems and the

767
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:42,179
expertise to be tracking all of this

768
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,099
information if you're not building your

769
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,140
supply chain and thinking about

770
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:48,418
partnering with people who are going to

771
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,880
have the capacity to give you their

772
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,440
reports on their emissions you're really

773
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,799
going to hit a brick wall and it's going

774
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,980
to become very expensive to be able to

775
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,839
address it in short order so it's really

776
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,778
actually an amazing thing that the EU

777
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,240
has done it's the most I would say

778
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:07,619
aggressive but positive reporting

779
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,839
standards that have been implemented

780
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:12,178
around the world they will affect the

781
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,158
Cannabis industry and I'm really really

782
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,960
passionate about this and happy to talk

783
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,340
with anybody who wants to get a little

784
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,380
bit of an understanding about what's

785
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:21,058
coming and how to start addressing it

786
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,820
because the more mature your company

787
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:26,639
becomes and the more complex it becomes

788
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,859
exponentially more expensive to be able

789
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,080
to address this when the requirements

790
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:33,178
are going to be hitting you okay Trenton

791
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,278
that was a great question and I

792
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,679
appreciate one thing I would just like

793
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,980
mention I take like your question took

794
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,659
me back to like our like the early days

795
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,819
2013 2014 when we were first putting the

796
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,440
regulations together the narrative then

797
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:49,019
was more about how do we keep the

798
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,120
federal government from preempting this

799
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:52,500
opportunity to start legalizing cannabis

800
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,619
so I don't think we were thinking about

801
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,298
a lot of as as much as we should have

802
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:58,859
the social justice issues or the

803
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:00,960
sustainability issues we were thinking

804
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,879
more like how do we package this product

805
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,399
in a way where

806
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,860
um uh it's really obvious it's cannabis

807
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:09,178
and and how much testing are we going to

808
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:11,099
do we weren't necessarily thinking about

809
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,860
those things I think there's like a

810
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:15,719
growing interest and certainly

811
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,699
addressing a lot of the social inequity

812
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,278
issues that are that are really

813
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,340
prominent in the US but I also think

814
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:25,440
sustainability is becoming more and more

815
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:27,058
important to businesses in the and even

816
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,740
like The Regulators are starting to like

817
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:31,319
backtrack and say okay how much

818
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,380
packaging do we really need on a

819
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:37,740
smokable cannabis that is not a danger

820
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,360
in its current form to anyone right even

821
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,919
kids and so

822
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,379
um it's not until it's decarboxylated

823
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,659
that it that it becomes like a an active

824
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,179
ingredient that that's that's a more of

825
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,500
a public health interest so the other

826
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,720
thing I would say too is like part of

827
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,298
like creating the digital transparent

828
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,100
Supply chains in the US it's created the

829
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:58,379
opportunity to actually start to report

830
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:00,778
on that so industry itself is thinking

831
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,760
like how do we start to really frame

832
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:05,880
what our carbon footprint is or what our

833
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,798
environmental footprint is on on

834
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,740
um the Earth and like it's like start

835
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:12,480
coming up with ways or like in like

836
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,339
including reporting on that like how

837
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,038
what minerals are used what pesticides

838
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,898
are used how much water is uh being used

839
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,819
for irrigation or how much energy is

840
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:22,500
being consumed to produce the product

841
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:24,898
and actually be able to report on that

842
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,819
in a way that most other Industries are

843
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:28,739
not doing or even really willing to do

844
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,298
and so I think the even though I think

845
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,700
it's kind of like still in its infancy

846
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:35,579
the industry itself just like it's

847
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,860
wanting to prove itself credible

848
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,199
um from the get-go is also interested in

849
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:43,199
like raising the bar on sustainability

850
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,880
and being able to report

851
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,778
um in in ways other Industries are just

852
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,778
not interested in doing

853
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,259
oh real quick so Trenton you and I know

854
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,298
each other so one thing it's the

855
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:57,240
question you're posing is really good

856
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:58,798
but it's funny because you do we're so

857
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,778
far from what you're talking about I

858
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,278
mean right now we talked to what

859
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,720
somebody later on the panel here is

860
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,278
going around trying to find money for

861
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,839
investment and there's a lot of

862
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,519
investors saying yeah sorry we're not

863
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,139
touching cannabis because we saw the

864
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,579
[ __ ] show that it's happened over the

865
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,100
last 10 years where good money's gone

866
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:16,079
into bad companies right and then you

867
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:18,000
have the fact that to Lewis point that

868
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,500
you know my I've worked at Cerna Cerner

869
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,599
was essentially making indoor climate

870
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,359
control systems for indoor grow-ops

871
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,699
indoor grow cannabis right now or THC

872
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,619
plus is not sustainable it's indoor grow

873
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,600
right it's that's not a sustainable

874
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,979
we're putting as much it's like a data a

875
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:33,178
data room where you're putting in a

876
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,460
bunch of energy and having to take it

877
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,200
back out so yeah it's a good point but

878
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,940
we're very far from that

879
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,399
all right so one last question right

880
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,460
here commandment and then hey everyone

881
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:46,739
uh my name is Oliver Cruz I'm the CEO of

882
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,600
takun USA we're a multi-state brand

883
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,179
focused on the medical consumer segment

884
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,740
and um David going off of you know kind

885
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,000
of what you just said

886
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,220
um I think a lot of investor

887
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,538
expectations have been out of whack and

888
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,740
in the past

889
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:00,720
um do you think that they're more

890
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,919
congruent with reality today and do you

891
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,558
think that the company valuations

892
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,659
reflect that

893
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,480
currently

894
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:12,720
I mean I I think in the past year in

895
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,059
Europe we've seen companies come to that

896
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,098
realization I I've seen valuations

897
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:18,960
throughout Europe come down anywhere

898
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,879
from 40 to 60 percent in the last 12

899
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,378
months so

900
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:26,098
um so yes

901
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:28,559
that's what happens in markets so when I

902
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,838
was doing biotech in 2008 when

903
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,519
everything went sideways it was

904
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:33,838
interesting if you know biotech phase

905
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,460
three companies are worth more than

906
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,838
phase two companies which were more than

907
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,480
what phase one and pre-clinical

908
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:41,639
everything was so out of whack in 2008

909
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,740
that you had phase three companies phase

910
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,480
two and phase one companies worth pretty

911
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,178
much the same amount of money things

912
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,740
happen like this okay it's it's the way

913
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,378
the world works so you know that's

914
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:53,759
what's done us a good job is that we've

915
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:55,739
been through biotech we know things

916
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,119
whipsaw back and forth and we knew this

917
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,559
was going to happen it might not it

918
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,720
might be around for another six months

919
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,279
12 months but you know if you survive

920
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:03,899
this and you can come out the other side

921
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,080
that's when your value is going to

922
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,079
matter

923
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,460
