1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,599
all right good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,519
so as in gail sid we are here to discuss

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,118
the future of cannabis

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
and the impact that the stigmas have

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,480
so we have

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,239
here stephen martin mayor from fido flow

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
and he's an expert on the colombian

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,159
market

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,879
we have viola brunette

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,238
who's from cannabis schizo

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,920
and

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,320
i probably pronounce that incorrectly i

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
apologize uh who's an expert on the

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,600
italian and swiss markets we have

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,320
rebecca allen tap who is from agi

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,439
who's an expert on american and uk

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
markets

18
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,759
and then we have stefan roll

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,439
the ceo of hemp group

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,960

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,840
spanish markets

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,038
so we're going to open our question with

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,239
we're going to open this panel

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,700
discussion

26
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:03,839
with

27
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,240
[Music]

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,000
from the countries that you're in

29
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,560
what types of social stigmas have you

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
experienced

31
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,839
so

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
i actually grew up in europe so i'm not

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
colombian i had

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,799
more than 15 years working in spain but

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
the last four years i've been working in

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
colombia for a company called plana

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,280
global

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
columbia is very interesting when it

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,478
comes to stigma because obviously the

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,200
first thing that comes to our minds when

41
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,519
we think of colombia is probably netflix

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,560
the narcos series right so

43
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,879
and we

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
before you you fly there the first time

45
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,199
that's the feeling you get is i'm gonna

46
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,438
go there and maybe pablo is still alive

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,840
the truth is um in the last ten years

48
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,679
there's been great changes and that has

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,759
also been a strategy of the government

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
is that um

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,399
since drugs are there and they are being

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
consumed and you can accuse colombia of

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,118
producing cocaine but somebody is buying

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,920
it and somebody is consuming it

55
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,799
apparently so why not try to make a

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,359
legal market out of that and

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,280
kind of refresh the image of colombia by

58
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,520
also bringing economic opportunities

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
which are legal so that has been a very

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
interesting

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,959
experience for me to go and be part of

62
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,759
this

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,840
of this experiment so to say though you

64
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,840
still really feel when you say that

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,598
you're working with cannabis in colombia

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,439
the first reaction is so why are you

67
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,439
here why are you talking to me

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,680
call the cops and then you explain there

69
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,439
is a medical legal market and things

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,640
change

71
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,439
so rebecca what about the u.s

72
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,279
so the us has continued to evolve um

73
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,199
when i was growing up it was very much

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,759
the i lived in california so it was very

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,598
much like the snoop dogg um kind of you

76
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,000
know chichen chang that's that's really

77
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,159
what you saw a lot of um but as it

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,919
started to legalize we saw

79
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,878
that it just completely changed you'd go

80
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,439
into a dispensary and you'd see you know

81
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,079
your neighbor's grandma you know you'd

82
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,759
see you know your your co-workers you'd

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
see every person there so i think the

84
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,120
legalization has really helped to

85
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,039
to change the stigma and shift it but

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
the interesting thing is is now because

87
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,560
it's so

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,479
political we're seeing that shift again

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
so recently in the us i'm sure you all

90
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,158
know there's an epidemic of gun violence

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,679
and there's been plenty of school

92
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,959
shootings and now those are actually

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,799
being tied into cannabis use so it's

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,479
it's a whole we're seeing a whole new

95
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,719
manifestation of a war on drugs

96
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,798
happening and stigma is the driving

97
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,560
force behind that so like everywhere

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,040
else i think it's just continuously

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,039
evolving

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
yeah

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,239
i would say in germany and since the

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
talk of the legalization it's getting

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,759
better but

104
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,959
still when you talk to people and say

105
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,399
that you're

106
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,640
a cannabis

107
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,158
consumer the most people think you're a

108
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,238
lazy pothead

109
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,679
and that's

110
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,480
truly not not true that's none of the

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
truth

112
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,158
but uh when i compare it uh to spain

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,920
their uh cannabis is more part of the

114
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,840
culture there we have the cannibal

115
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,798
social clubs and

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,920
like

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,950
smoking cannabis for recreational uses

118
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,719
they're not a big deal

119
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:20,319
[Music]

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,320
this is what my art is coming from

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,199
hi everyone thank you for being here

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,360
after lunch thank you digest with us

123
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,680
i come from italy i'm working currently

124
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,600
both in italy and in switzerland

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,759
uh in italy we had a legal medical

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
cannabis for now 10 years almost 10

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
years

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
and

129
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,039
although we were just discussing this

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,199
one thing is changing regulations it

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,479
takes time but it doesn't take as much

132
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,400
time as changing a culture so

133
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,360
one of the things for example that we

134
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:59,120
still notice is the choice of words that

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,000
still are trying to in some ways feel uh

136
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
less

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,038
aggressive so many even many doctors who

138
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
i train healthcare professionals is what

139
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,279
we do with our company

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
and often we have

141
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,038
you know our students and our medical

142
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,399
doctors that instead of using the word

143
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:19,599
cannabis they still say can happen which

144
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,239
is a medical hemp because in some ways

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
it feels less dangerous

146
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
it feels less of a drug because what

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,199
they heard for so many years is that

148
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,679
cannabis is was just associated with a

149
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
narcotic and with something completely

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
illicit so the moment that they find

151
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,759
themselves actually having the

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
possibility to prescribe it legally in

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,879
their

154
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,079
in their in their office in their

155
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:48,240
medical practice they need to find ways

156
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:51,038
to feel better about that and and so

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,439
changing a culture it will take way

158
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:57,839
longer so i would say it's a sort of

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:01,038
like george orwell 1984

160
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,839
idea so if you don't have the word you

161
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:07,360
don't think about it and so um for

162
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,879
example i will assume that in the states

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,000
that there is still very strong this

164
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,120
idea of the marijuana world still used

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,360
for a very strong stigma around it and

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,439
the type of consumers actually or the

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,600
type of people around the marijuana

168
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,399
world right so it's actually being like

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
taken out of what like some of the the

170
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,318
like the regulation work so like

171
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,239
washington state actually just made it

172
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,439
so that marijuana is no longer a

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,079
terminology used um in any of their

174
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,399
their compliance or regulatory policy so

175
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,879
here's a question then and this is

176
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,599
it's actually just listening to you guys

177
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,478
it's governments and large corporations

178
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,960
that are

179
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,598
creating stigmas as well now or feeding

180
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,000
into this which is causing confusion

181
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,079
because as you're pointing out hemp

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
versus cannabis

183
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,000
is is not the same thing

184
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,960
yeah it's um

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,879
we i work and i have a cd company and

186
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,560
when you speak with people outside of

187
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,959
dentistry and you tell them yeah i work

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,199
in the legal cannabis industry in cbd

189
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,598
the most people start smiling and saying

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,280
yeah it makes you happy and it's not

191
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,560
about this

192
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,519
it's more than

193
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,720
making you high and this is a stigma in

194
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,240
the industry

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,560
and then that's an interesting thing as

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
well because

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,639
cannabis does make you high

198
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
but people when they want to talk about

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,280
being a patient it's about easing pain

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
and nobody wants to acknowledge

201
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,119
the high part of it

202
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,799
and and again that's a stigma what's

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
wrong with being high

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
yeah i would like to add that often i

205
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,280
mean from a medical perspective you can

206
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,318
see euphoria described as the side

207
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,878
effect excuse me but i think afaria is a

208
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,680
pretty decent effect to be given to a

209
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,400
patient to be honest with you

210
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,478
okay so as a patient

211
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,799
that i hate that stigma i hate that i

212
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,639
have to feel uncomfortable about my

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
cannabis use especially like if i'm

214
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
using it and i'm just trying to use it

215
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,639
to relax i'm not using it for

216
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,319
for whatever i would typically use you

217
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,918
know i'm using it because

218
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,919
sometimes i'm out i don't want to drink

219
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,359
so i bring my own my own stuff but i

220
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,598
feel i have to kind of hide it because

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
i'm like almost then like okay well i'm

222
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,399
not helping the patient cause if i'm if

223
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,758
i'm using cannabis outside of medicinal

224
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,000
use you know because it's we have

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,240
everything has to be in a neat box

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,720
you know cannabis hemp patient

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
recreational medical it's we we have to

228
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,560
have these clear defined boxes and i

229
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
think that this is this is something

230
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,079
that's not going to easily fit and i

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
think that we're finding that well and

232
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,519
it's interesting and and you can ask

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
yourself this question

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,719
uh

235
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,120
if you use cannabis how do you say you

236
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,120
use it how do you categorize yourself do

237
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,399
you call yourself a patient

238
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,399
because if you are

239
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,720
do you have a prescription

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,159
if you do where did you get it from

241
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,399
yeah it also opens up a big

242
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,519
conversation here or a big issue to

243
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,519
understand also when wellness ends and

244
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,759
medical starts because if i go to the

245
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,519
spine and get a massage maybe that's the

246
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,919
reason why i'm not going into surgery

247
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,360
because i have a real issue

248
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,278
with my back you see what i mean so that

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,919
there is a there is a certain um

250
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,320
preventive action that wellness does and

251
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,838
and and in that direction i think it's

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,240
important to understand that it's not a

253
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,240
defined um

254
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
defined concept and and around this

255
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,559
there is a lot to do with uh what do you

256
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,639
do you know

257
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,079
you might not be sick but you you are

258
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,439
absorbing a lot of stress on the

259
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,240
workplace no and so it is he's having a

260
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,640
little uh smoke at night uh something

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,879
that is just recreational adult use or

262
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,439
is it maybe something that prevents you

263
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,759
then to get into serious anxiety and all

264
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
these kind of you know more complicated

265
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,639
sleep better exactly sleep quality very

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,000
important um so so there i think there

267
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,720
is a lot of confusion that this

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,639
confusion we tend to try to put into the

269
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
same categories okay yesterday was

270
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,439
having a conversation with the doctor

271
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,759
and said yeah but you know with morphine

272
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
we have morphine and there's a scale and

273
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,360
you can yeah okay but this is not

274
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,560
morphing you know i understand those are

275
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,000
true morphine you want to be very

276
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,199
careful or it might be the last thing

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,759
you do but with cannabis you can self

278
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,759
train and you probably uh almost

279
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,559
certainly won't die you know and just

280
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,399
like

281
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,799
riding a bicycle you have to find your

282
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,559
own equilibrium but then you you will

283
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,519
understand what is the limit right but

284
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,439
that

285
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,720
is making people accountable for their

286
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
own behavior

287
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,600
and every society struggles with that

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,600
yes

289
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
so that's why i'm gonna jump in

290
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,879
we've all talked about this the

291
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,039
importance of setting intention with

292
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,039
your use regardless of how you're using

293
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,719
it you need to have attention intention

294
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,559
and set in setting is not just for

295
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
psychedelics and i think that we should

296
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,639
really incorporate that into it to

297
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,559
cannabis use as well and really getting

298
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,639
into the mind of why am i using this

299
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,000
what is my goal what is my intention and

300
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,439
what do i want to get out of it and i

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,679
think that if we just took that time and

302
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
put space between action and reaction

303
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,199
and really like thought about what we

304
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,480
were doing um not just with you know

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
with eating you know so just putting

306
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,360
food in your face same thing with using

307
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,599
with using any kind of you know

308
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,519
recreational or medical drug why are we

309
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
using it and how long was the intention

310
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,879
behind it

311
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,359
so then

312
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,879
that's a very good point and again i'm

313
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,700
going to say that's accountability that

314
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,798
people don't belong

315
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,799
[Music]

316
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,078
what about let's talk about the illicit

317
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,489
markets

318
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:36,558
and the stigmas behind that

319
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,558
[Music]

320
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,078
all right so i'll take that um

321
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,399
i came from the us obviously so it's no

322
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:50,159
our our war on drugs has influenced the

323
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,000
world um which we are i'm the first to

324
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,360
be here and say sorry everyone for

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,799
problems

326
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,959
on behalf of my country um

327
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,719
so it's challenging because then then

328
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,159
we've kind of taken this other stigma

329
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,160
direction which i think is interesting

330
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,600
where you hear so much about the illicit

331
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,679
market in the black market right and

332
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,839
they're like demonized thugs

333
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,479
uh

334
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,399
whereas yeah but my experience is like

335
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,800
one of my i have you know i i've

336
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,039
definitely sourced illicitly plenty of

337
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,439
times with them and i would get things

338
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,480
like um

339
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,120
special strings for what i'm looking for

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,120
they would do more testing than some of

341
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
the uh some of the producers that i

342
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,159
actually can purchase through on the

343
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,440
prescription drop i can actually get a

344
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,559
coa

345
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,600
from my illicit source easier than i can

346
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,679
get one

347
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,600
from a prescription pharmacy in the uk

348
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,519
um they also will tell me kind of what

349
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,879
to expect here's the terpene profiles

350
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,720
and give me more information on it

351
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,559
here's what it will feel like my doctors

352
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
can't tell me that

353
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
so there's not a lot of incentive i

354
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,759
think that that's another way to push

355
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,320
people into

356
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,679
you know more of the standardized uh a

357
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,360
format is by demonizing uh the enlisted

358
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,359
market because there's also that

359
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,079
caregiver model in california you know

360
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,240
in the in the 90s when medical became

361
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,319
legal there was the caregiver format

362
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,720
where people would grow in a community

363
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
for patients in their community and i

364
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
think that's something we really need to

365
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,078
explore but that that's they're really

366
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,799
making it challenging for for individual

367
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,519
growers and and do you feel that

368
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,799
when it comes to quality illicit versus

369
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,799
the large corporations

370
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,240
yeah it's i mean at europa we were like

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,679
opening up our flowers smell this almost

372
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,079
you can you can tell the difference i

373
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,838
mean the nose knows um it's it's a

374
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,719
completely different quality but that's

375
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,560
also

376
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
building a relationship there's a human

377
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,078
relationship factor there as well i

378
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
don't know my producers if i go through

379
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,239
the prescription route it's picked for

380
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,199
me but if i go through my my local

381
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,519
grower

382
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,359
i know what he likes his interest his

383
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,759
what matters to him so i know how he

384
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,519
cares about about growing the plants and

385
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,039
and the people he's caring for so

386
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,159
there's just that relationship there i

387
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,159
think that's something we're missing

388
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,920
all right um what about let's talk about

389
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,160
what do you see

390
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,759
in the near future what changes do you

391
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,719
see coming when it comes to stigmas and

392
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,360
the impacts it's going to have

393
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,040
yeah one thing i i

394
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,199
really

395
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,599
[Music]

396
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,000
feel should be addressed is especially

397
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,839
even the mainstream media speaks about

398
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,078
it all the time is that there is this

399
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,320
feeling that cannabis will be consumed

400
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,958
once it's legal you know and you know

401
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
the hundreds of millions of consumers

402
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,638
yesterday night i don't know if somebody

403
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,399
was here at the smoking area of the

404
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,879
concert it smelled familiar to me so

405
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
cannabis is already being consumed the

406
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,439
question is what will happen once it's

407
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,039
legal and the the feeling is also that

408
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,959
once it's legal all the problems are

409
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,559
solved but you've seen that with gay

410
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,919
rights for example you know now we have

411
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,719
gay rights in europe but you can still

412
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,879
go to rural areas and walk hand in hand

413
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
uh same sex and probably they'll throw

414
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,320
stones at you so

415
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,000
it doesn't change with the legality the

416
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,639
legality is not the beginning and it's

417
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,799
not the end the legality is a change in

418
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,079
compliance it's just changing how the

419
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,799
legal system and the society processes

420
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,159
uh whatever your personal consumption is

421
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,159
but

422
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,919
the fight goes on and i think it's very

423
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,919
important as an industry we also get

424
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,159
together of course we are all working

425
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,159
for competing companies but we get

426
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,719
together and realize that tobacco and

427
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,198
alcohol have strong lobbies they work

428
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,879
together to get the best rules so then

429
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,120
they can play the game of

430
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,519
i sell more than you but before there is

431
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,198
a lobby and i have the feeling that the

432
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,759
economy's industries he still has to

433
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,439
mature a lot in that in that aspect so

434
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,839
that the fight will go on and the

435
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,639
changes will occur also after big

436
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,560
changes like in germany occur this is an

437
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,799
ongoing process and especially to remove

438
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,119
the stigma i was giving you the example

439
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,519
the other day very quickly uh if i was

440
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,600
at a graduation uh someone getting you

441
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,759
know finishing university if i bring a

442
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,240
bottle of champagne i've seen as

443
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,720
as a very nice person if i bring a bong

444
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,360
um probably i i'm going to be looked at

445
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,120
who's this weirdo you know call security

446
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,800
and that that really shows you the

447
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,120
stigma because at that moment we should

448
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,278
be allowed to you know party or

449
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,600
celebrate in whatever form or shape we

450
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,000
feel is the right one right

451
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,159
yeah and when you come to conferences uh

452
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,559
you get drinks for free but uh why don't

453
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,240
you get drugs for free

454
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,838
now you're pushing it

455
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
you actually get like in trouble

456
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,559
this is a cannabis conference don't

457
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,560
spill that out right here

458
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,559
maybe this idea for the next icbc

459
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,399
there's a suggestion uh so then uh

460
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,159
another stigma uh tying into this the

461
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,958
whole the legal side of it

462
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,078
if

463
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,838
the fear

464
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,799
is behind

465
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
getting

466
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,879
like charged

467
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,959
yeah this is uh i would say uh for a lot

468
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,000
of uh chemist patients and in germany

469
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,558
right now

470
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,798
the only reason there are patients is

471
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,119
that we don't get fined from the police

472
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,078
because as a cannabis patient

473
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,798
like me

474
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,119
i have some pain but this is

475
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,798
my most reason to be a patient is to

476
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,119
don't get in trouble with the cops when

477
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,400
i have my weed with me when i travel and

478
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,119
when i smoke

479
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,320
um and there's also okay so so you

480
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:33,678
called yourself a patient yeah and uh

481
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:36,720
the whole thing is that when germany

482
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,960
when everything is organized and legal

483
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,720
wreck site medical side will you still

484
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,000
call yourself a patient

485
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,880
it depends uh on the laws but i'm

486
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,119
hopefully not i'm a recreational user

487
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
and i know the benefits for me cannabis

488
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,119
is like a superfood

489
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,280
i use it in my daily nutrition i use not

490
00:17:53,119 --> 00:18:00,479
just thc i used cbd cbg all the very

491
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,879
priority of a cannabis it's not just

492
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,798
to make you high like i said before

493
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,200
if we are

494
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,400
able to talk more openly about cannabis

495
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
that can give us much more

496
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
that's true

497
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,558
maybe i'm gonna have a slightly

498
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,279
different opinion on this for example in

499
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:22,960
in my country in italy um i would say

500
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,160
probably around max five percent of the

501
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,319
patients

502
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,798
are there because i have a prescription

503
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,480
because there are recreational consumers

504
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,839
however you want to call a recreational

505
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,519
consumer i really like stefan's wellness

506
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,439
concept because i think

507
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,119
it really makes a good point

508
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,919
for several reasons i mean the

509
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:45,279
prescription process isn't really smooth

510
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,280
like in most countries still

511
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,599
the black market is still cheaper than

512
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,359
going to a pharmacy

513
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,599
so actually

514
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,399
my art i would say that 80

515
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,079
75 percent of the patients

516
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
patients that we have for the medical

517
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,480
market in italy are naive

518
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,159
to economies they never tried cannabis

519
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,038
before

520
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,960
what i'm fearing for the future in

521
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,480
europe

522
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,319
moving towards the direction of

523
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,400
recreational market which of course

524
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,960
we're all looking forward to is that

525
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
this is going to happen before a true

526
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,120
maturing of the medical markets what do

527
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:26,079
i mean with a true uh arriving to a true

528
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,279
mature point what i mean is at least

529
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,720
getting

530
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,440
free healthcare

531
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,919
meaning it totally remorse medication

532
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,038
for the medical market so in that way i

533
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,080
can ensure that patients actually are

534
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,400
still getting a product that is at the

535
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,519
highest quality

536
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,759
possible

537
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,639
and then of course as much as we can go

538
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,960
to a store and buy one or go in a bar

539
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,400
and get hourglass

540
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,279
of course i'm looking forward to a

541
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
recreational market but if we implement

542
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,440
it now

543
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,600
in which our medical markets are still

544
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,159
not i mean the majority prescription

545
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,399
both here in germany in italy in the in

546
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,240
the active medical markets that say

547
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
they're still private so this is going

548
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,000
to create a huge issue because of course

549
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,960
the moment that you have a smoother path

550
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,359
through a rock market than the medical

551
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
market anyone is going to anyone i mean

552
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,759
any person that needs cannabis even for

553
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,119
medical reasons it's going to go through

554
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,359
the market and what's going to be the

555
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:31,199
guarantee for the patient

556
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,798
very very little so i don't i don't

557
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,840
i mean i'm looking forward for

558
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,079
everything to lose fast but mainly for

559
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,480
insurances and

560
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,158
public health care to really take this

561
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,679
on board because otherwise we are not

562
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,720
creating a really

563
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,400
good scenario for patients to be honest

564
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,079
it's very good points

565
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,960
um and and then i'm gonna touch on um

566
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,158
the pros and cons of growing your own

567
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,840
so as a patient if you're able to grow

568
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,320
your own flower and consume it at your

569
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,319
own risk if you know what you're doing

570
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,678
um but where do you see that going what

571
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,399
are the pros and cons with growing your

572
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,400
own flower then

573
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,000
maybe here

574
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,480
i have a little bit of a controversial

575
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,519
usually opinion because i have

576
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,759
i was once in in uruguay and i had quite

577
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,079
a few mothers running after me in that

578
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,558
case it was a an association called mama

579
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,960
cultiva and it was matters growing for

580
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,440
their own kids which were affected by

581
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
epilepsy and i gave the negative opinion

582
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,440
on that

583
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,159
kind of uh situation because i feel

584
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,240
this is a very serious condition and um

585
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,080
you need to know exactly what dosage

586
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,599
what what exactly the kids are getting

587
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,319
and especially you need to go through

588
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,199
quality control um

589
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,119
intentions are not the only good thing

590
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,360
that you can do and it's a good thing to

591
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,599
have good intentions but contaminations

592
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,399
they come also with good intentions so

593
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,719
if

594
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,640
the cannabis absorbs a contribution from

595
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,120
the soil from the air you can do a lot

596
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,038
of bad things a total quality control of

597
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,959
a batch would cost you i would say

598
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,720
between two and three thousand dollars

599
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,400
if you want to go and see pesticides

600
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,679
heavy metal all the

601
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,440
microbiology and and so there i

602
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,519
you know depending on the condition i am

603
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,519
not so much in favor of uh people

604
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,079
growing for themselves like on the other

605
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,440
side i met adults in canada which were

606
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,079
on a wheelchair because they were

607
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,558
actually you know a traffic accident

608
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,879
actually the driver in this example i'm

609
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,759
thinking right now was a drunk so so he

610
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,760
was also the victim of um of a drunk

611
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,919
driver and he was growing his own

612
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,359
cannabis but now it was for a condition

613
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,080
of chronic pain in this case i justify

614
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,399
the the the consumption much more than

615
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,319
in a kid with epilepsy because

616
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,559
first of all you know

617
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,720
there was also the beautiful experience

618
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,240
of growing your own medicine which was

619
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,519
you know he was really proud of his own

620
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,319
plans

621
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,240
but you know adult use

622
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,558
chronic pain you find also what's the

623
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,839
right genetic for yourself that is much

624
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,639
more of a

625
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,319
easy to accept personal consumption or

626
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,400
personal growing that's a little bit my

627
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,399
own opinion

628
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,919
but um i wouldn't think that there's a

629
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,320
problem with the pesticides and stuff

630
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,679
that is because uh right now everybody

631
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,639
uh allowed to grow their own tomatoes or

632
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,600
fruits or stuff and people do it and

633
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,600
they

634
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,519
they know what they do they want to have

635
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,558
it like a hobby and want to do something

636
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,798
special

637
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,879
totally organic stuff like this and i

638
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,879
think this is the direction where home

639
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
grow goes it's

640
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,520
when you look at alcohol it's not

641
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,480
forbidden to to make your own but who

642
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,879
does it

643
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,679
just a really few uh for have something

644
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,840
special for for a special night for for

645
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,798
friends and i think it will be the same

646
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:54,079
with cannabis sure there will be some

647
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,119
guys who are growing their own cannabis

648
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,839
right now and they will do it in the

649
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,359
future for their friends they just don't

650
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,158
have to fear about

651
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,719
the police anymore

652
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,000
so even even like uh in the u.s like

653
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,600
some of the stuff that's even grown

654
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
that's just sold to dispensaries you go

655
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,918
in and you think oh it's safe it's been

656
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
tested for everything but that's

657
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,360
actually not the case like even going

658
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,278
through and buying something that has to

659
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,759
go through like a rig of roll of rules

660
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,960
and metric system and all that bs

661
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,400
there's

662
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,400
still not good testing standards for

663
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,038
things like microbials

664
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
and heavy metals and pesticides and each

665
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,240
state has different ones so it's kind of

666
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,960
like looking at that model and then

667
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,038
exploring the home grow it's it's

668
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,919
i don't really know what's where there's

669
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,558
a good

670
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,559
satisfied model already in existence

671
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,240
because even what you're buying and you

672
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,918
think is safe isn't it isn't safe and

673
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,759
there just aren't proper standards for

674
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,679
testing out yet

675
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,798
and at the same time let's say everybody

676
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,400
is able to grow the best flower ever

677
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,038
this is also very disruptive for the

678
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,159
large corporations

679
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,960
so what type of impact do you think they

680
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,720
would want to to impose

681
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,759
on a stigma

682
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,558
around

683
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:09,919
the way you're going to grow your flower

684
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,798
you know i wanted to just continue the

685
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,000
conversation on self on homegrown and

686
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,158
the direction it probably will go

687
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,038
i i tend to agree with what stephanie is

688
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,919
saying i don't necessarily see it as a

689
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:26,400
solution for medical absolutely but at

690
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,880
the same time there are there is a lot

691
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,880
of untapped potential in cannabis we are

692
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,480
all thinking about

693
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,400
decarboxylated

694
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
cannabis and when i think about

695
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,519
homegrown i actually think about

696
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,600
wellness and getting my own fresh

697
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,798
raw juice or

698
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,359
acids

699
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,519
and flavonoids and a lot of good stuff

700
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,678
that i wouldn't be able to get

701
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,240
anywhere in a shop whether that's a

702
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,000
recreational market or a medical market

703
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,880
and and really from

704
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
using the roots of the plant to the

705
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,559
sprouts there is so many compounds into

706
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,400
interesting tree terpenoids and

707
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,879
a lot of stuff beyond cannabinoids that

708
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,960
is incredibly interesting on a wellness

709
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,360
perspective so

710
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,919
and also i mean to be a bit uh the crazy

711
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,240
neuroscientist um i think it's also

712
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,320
important to really to think about

713
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,640
let's say the manufacturing process as

714
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,480
in the the growing process and the type

715
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,360
of energy that you put in it and of

716
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,319
course that's uh i mean very

717
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,079
up in there maybe but for a lot of like

718
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,319
ancient culture it wasn't because if you

719
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,439
think about how for example ayurvedic

720
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,079
medicine are produced people pray before

721
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,960
starting to to to take the roots and

722
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,119
then manufacturing them and so on so

723
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,319
yeah then you make your little batch of

724
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:49,278
let's say your home instead of your home

725
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:51,278
grandpa or whatever you have your own

726
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,278
homemade

727
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,400
special things that you can make your

728
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,640
friends try either for fun or for or for

729
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,360
wellness and that's great but is that a

730
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,799
solution for the mothers in

731
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:07,278
uruguay no but no also because i don't

732
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,558
expect everyone to have the time and the

733
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:13,359
tools and the capacity or even the the

734
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,519
clean soil i mean you can be as

735
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,398
strict as you want on your own way of

736
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,798
cultivating but i'm thinking for example

737
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,439
i come from north of italy where it's

738
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:26,319
there is a lot of growing and completely

739
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,399
non-organic so you can be as organic as

740
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,200
you want but then you will have to put

741
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,038
so many bushes to protect your land that

742
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,038
basically the patch that you have

743
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,839
available is super tiny

744
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,000
so yeah it can work like you need to

745
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,918
basically reflect to real life and real

746
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,519
life it's not like we all have this like

747
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,200
massive land of organic and irvana and

748
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,960
everything is going to be great because

749
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
you have great intentions behind it

750
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,319
very good points

751
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,240
and now i'm going to bring up the

752
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,439
obvious stigma

753
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,038
uh the stoner let's talk about stoners

754
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,360
when you hear the word stoner what do

755
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,038
you think of what comes to mind

756
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,959
and i'll i'm going to share what comes

757
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,960
to my mind is it's usually a man

758
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,759
it's true

759
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,840
sorry

760
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,398
but it's true but that's that's it's

761
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,519
really an image that comes to mind so

762
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,599
what do you guys think of when you hear

763
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,319
the word stoner and why are we so afraid

764
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,678
to be called a stoner

765
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,879
i think stefan

766
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,720
stefan just said it

767
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,080
i mean he just said it before exactly

768
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,558
that image of the unaccomplished too

769
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,558
lazy

770
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,880
it's measured with productivity

771
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,960
absolutely i mean and unfortunately i

772
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,039
think still in the type of world we live

773
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,798
in a success

774
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,960
of a person is based a lot on the

775
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,200
ultimate goal of their productivity

776
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,850
which also i find pretty strange but

777
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,480
that's for another topic probably

778
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:56,558
[Music]

779
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,240
go on what comes to mind

780
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,240
i mean you guys made some great points

781
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,679
but it is true i really think about like

782
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,038
productivity at the stereotype of the

783
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,919
lazy stoner

784
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:04,879
um

785
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,640
uh

786
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
the thing that i think is interesting

787
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,320
too is that

788
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,720
i feel like there's this culture too

789
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,798
with working cannabis is that

790
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,240
we can work and go to these conferences

791
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,918
but i don't know that everyone is like

792
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,319
it's acceptable like socially admit that

793
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,399
you're using cannabis you know either or

794
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,158
even if you're like medicinally using it

795
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,439
using it before work i think that

796
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,760
there's still a lot with that and it's

797
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
seen as like i know we were talking

798
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,079
about

799
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,720
a colleague that

800
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,639
can can use cannabis at any time of day

801
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,558
and and it actually calms their mind and

802
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,080
they do better whereas i think that the

803
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,918
intention and when people look at you

804
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,038
you think okay well if they they use it

805
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,480
they're not gonna get anything done

806
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,079
they're just gonna sit around smoke and

807
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,120
eat food and clock out

808
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,798
and i think that that's you know

809
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,079
perpetuating that because a lot of us

810
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:49,918
are here fighting for it and i think

811
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,839
that it should be more acceptable in the

812
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
workplace as well within within bounds

813
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,278
with boundaries

814
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,679
well that's interesting because yeah you

815
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,798
go for a few beers for lunch you come

816
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,399
back to work and that's okay

817
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,158
but yeah but what are people going to

818
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,558
think of you if you go out have a joint

819
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,240
come back and you're high

820
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,398
well i think it's about amount to like

821
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,000
amount amount of use you know like um

822
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:13,519
like for instance i talked about people

823
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,278
making their own stuff i'm a big fan of

824
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,278
people making their own stuff i do my

825
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,440
own coconut oils and i put that coconut

826
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:20,798
oil in my coffee and i do only like a

827
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
quarter of a teaspoon and i take it

828
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,398
every single day and i do it before i go

829
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,000
to work but no one can know that's in my

830
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,319
coffee i mean now obviously because it's

831
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,119
out there you guys know my secrets

832
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,240
but

833
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,719
it it makes me better at my job because

834
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,640
there's so much going on and there's so

835
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,399
much to do in this industry i bet

836
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
everyone this audience is doing 15

837
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,599
things right now while watching this

838
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,359
panel you're probably posting talking

839
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,599
about it like figuring out you know

840
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,079
content and scheduling meetings we've

841
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,798
got so much work to do that helps me

842
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,519
close some of those tabs in my brain and

843
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,839
i don't want to feel like me using that

844
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,759
to help me get work done it makes me any

845
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,240
less productive in the eyes of my

846
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,240
employers

847
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,398
just like stoner is a stereotype that we

848
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,480
have to try to get rid of but

849
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,079
stereotypes in general are bad you know

850
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,159
we don't we all have a different phase

851
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,158
we all have a different dna and we all

852
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,559
have a different cannabinoid system so

853
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,000
some people react to cannabis in a way

854
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:17,918
which makes them more productive and

855
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,599
others become couch potatoes or whatever

856
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,200
you want to call them and so everybody

857
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,798
has to find their own

858
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,440
inner balance you know the famous

859
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,599
homeostasis which is the basics the

860
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,360
basics also of what the endocannabinoid

861
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,558
system does and

862
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,558
at the end your productivity is

863
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,798
something you have to see whether you're

864
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,398
productive or not right so

865
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:37,759
too much coffee also makes you too

866
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,119
nervous and you're not productive but

867
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,359
nobody's going to tell you they don't

868
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,439
don't have another coffee but ultimately

869
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,839
those are really personal things i think

870
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,919
if you really want to take away the

871
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:51,359
stereotype yeah for me it's dollar some

872
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,320
one who misuse cannabis who use it way

873
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,000
too much um for some people it's it's

874
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,678
the best to use cannabis in the morning

875
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,640
to to start the day

876
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,960
for me not and then i get too lazy but i

877
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,440
know it for myself i know exactly when

878
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,000
it's good for me to use cannabis

879
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,880
and i don't use it every day but some

880
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,319
days i start earlier some days i start

881
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,880
later but

882
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,678
every day is different so you're an

883
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,720
accountable stoner

884
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,200
yeah like

885
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,440
i would say sure the misuse of cannabis

886
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,679
refuses too much it happens for

887
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,320
for a party like last night or the night

888
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,320
before but not on a ripple basically but

889
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,558
that doesn't mean i'm a stoner for me a

890
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:35,439
stoner is somebody who

891
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,759
who uses it on a daily basis for me like

892
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,000
almost abusing it yeah

893
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,759
i think that's his intentions

894
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,519
yeah exactly

895
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,440
i think it's important we

896
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,599
also i mean we are the industry so it's

897
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,759
really important we check our own bias

898
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:53,119
at the door i remember once i was

899
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,519
visiting uh stefan mayer at the place he

900
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,558
was working there so i was just passing

901
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,880
by behind one of his several calls and

902
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,879
he was on a call with some colleagues

903
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,960
some of them were from canada

904
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
and for me it was very

905
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,200
peculiar the fact that

906
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,440
without taking off the screen camera so

907
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,798
like oh sorry now is my camera isn't

908
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,519
working oh no they were in front of the

909
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,359
camera a couple of them took it up

910
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,000
and for me i mean i've been working in

911
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,158
this industry now 11 years and

912
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,278
so i should be totally okay with that

913
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,840
but i was like

914
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,319
it's just like the corporate world for

915
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,639
you you know and so and then then i

916
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,278
realized that also i might be part of

917
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,038
the problem if i find that shocking

918
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,200
because we might i might not have

919
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,519
like the little foreign of panache or

920
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,919
rattler as you call here so

921
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,679
uh i think it's important also

922
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,320
i mean this is the reason of this panel

923
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,679
like where is our bias and i think you

924
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:54,079
for you that we're mentioning as well on

925
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,440
employing point of view do i want to

926
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,278
employ someone that clearly looks like

927
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,200
someone that is a massive consumer but

928
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:01,919
then the point is that one

929
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,558
i

930
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,880
as we all mentioned there are some

931
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,838
people that if there aren't consumers

932
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,440
they're not going to be as good workers

933
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:17,279
as they could so um i think it's to keep

934
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,039
this uh point uh always in check

935
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,320
and and that's the thing it starts with

936
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,480
us as as as an individual for yourself

937
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,559
and how you perceive things

938
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,599
and it's an awareness right

939
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,480
um

940
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,240
let's talk about women

941
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,679
and stigmas

942
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,959
with cannabis

943
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,960
i i would like to start sorry

944
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,199
yeah since we where are the women right

945
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,280
i would also like to the men the men can

946
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,838
accept mansplain

947
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,839
if they would like

948
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,519
i understand i work in the american side

949
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,519
and health care side so one of the

950
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,920
toughest part is always when it comes to

951
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,719
the point of the mother or the woman

952
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,838
that wants to become a mother or

953
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,799
the the doctor that has to what do i do

954
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:09,039
with shall i take off this medication

955
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,880
i'm talking about a medical patient so

956
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,199
let's say for example a lot of

957
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,640
conditions may be crowning a few a lot

958
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,879
of conditions that we considered

959
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,960
deficiency the result of the deficiency

960
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,240
of the endocannabinoid system mainly

961
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,960
they are

962
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,799
the incidence is way higher women so

963
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,240
then it comes to this point of the life

964
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,359
of a woman that she might become a

965
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,399
mother and there it really is struggling

966
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,039
for

967
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,720
pretty much any doctor what do i do with

968
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,039
this because cannabis was working so

969
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,959
well shall i take her off

970
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,039
or shall i

971
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,920
keep her on it because then there is a

972
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,440
massive stigma from the other colleagues

973
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,358
some weeks ago we were at cannabis

974
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,639
europe in london and there was actually

975
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,400
a panel on on women's health and that dr

976
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,000
dani gordon was talking about the fact

977
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,480
that she was completely agreeing on the

978
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,838
importance for women that phone their

979
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,679
balance

980
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,358
for treating their pathology with

981
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,799
medical cannabis

982
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,799
but at the same time she wasn't feeling

983
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,039
brave enough she said i'm just report

984
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,359
quoting awards to

985
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,079
make a prescription to a woman that was

986
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:17,279
either pregnant or breastfeeding i think

987
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,280
here it really is important then to

988
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,920
and i'm sorry and on these i work in

989
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,440
education so i'm gonna i'm gonna repeat

990
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,079
this but it's really really important

991
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,519
the education silence for example there

992
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,960
are different is different the

993
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,639
metabolism in terms of

994
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,000
tshcoh and so on

995
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,078
between

996
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,400
a product that has a pharmacokinetics

997
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,400
for example through inhalation or

998
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,880
through an oral consumption

999
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,119
and this is a important difference in

1000
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,720
the rate of penetration for example in

1001
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,280
the in the fetus

1002
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:52,078
so then it's really a matter of what

1003
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,440
type of product it's gonna

1004
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,599
be best for this state of condition

1005
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,599
another another situation is that with

1006
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,480
that of breastfeeding because of course

1007
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,200
as

1008
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,519
some of you may know in in our in our

1009
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,439
own human milk also animal milk

1010
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,480
there are endocannabinoids there's a lot

1011
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,000
of torah

1012
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,559
glycerol so so um it's actually a great

1013
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,199
matrix a great tobacco for cannabinoids

1014
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:20,400
so usually muscle time is breastfeeding

1015
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:23,118
is one of the most difficult moment for

1016
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,760
you know as a an administration of

1017
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,200
cannabis rather than actually pregnancy

1018
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,280
and and then you need to take in

1019
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,439
consideration the quality of the life

1020
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,000
not only of the matter but also of the

1021
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,079
child because i mean the

1022
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,719
past part of depression it's a real

1023
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,560
thing so if you think about a patient

1024
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,118
that so far was

1025
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,759
balanced with her medication you remove

1026
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,160
her medication so you're unbalancing her

1027
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,920
and then she's also going through a very

1028
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,879
crazy and balancing moment of their life

1029
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,280
i mean the day of giving birth is the

1030
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,039
highest amount of neurostar steroids

1031
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,400
that anyone can can secrete

1032
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,920
then what do you do and then we have on

1033
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,200
the other side

1034
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,320
a very well designed and very nice

1035
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:13,679
protocol on benzodiazepines

1036
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,440
is that you know is that a good solution

1037
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,279
i'm sorry i bring this up because we

1038
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,960
often have this conversation on the fact

1039
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,920
that even um you know our in our medical

1040
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,519
community of of cannabis doctors or

1041
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,519
doctors that have been prescribing for a

1042
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,759
long time but because cannabis as you

1043
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,400
all know it's not a first-line treatment

1044
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,560
then they feel safer especially in the

1045
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,960
situation of a woman over planning a

1046
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,078
pregnancy to use stuff that actually if

1047
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,358
you look at has a much shorter

1048
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,400
window of safety because you can die and

1049
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:49,880
you can have a pretty bad addiction with

1050
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,880
for example benzodiazepines

1051
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,720
okay so i'm going to add in my own

1052
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,000
story with my own experience based on

1053
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,118
what you said because we have like the

1054
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
clinical point of view and then the

1055
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,440
patient point of view so

1056
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,440
um i had that i have a four-year-old and

1057
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,200
i was pregnant while i still had cancer

1058
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,760
so i was still a medical patient using

1059
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,439
cannabis in in the us where it was

1060
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,480
recreationally legal

1061
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,358
um

1062
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,559
i

1063
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,719
was

1064
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,440
carrying they decided to let me continue

1065
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,199
on with it i was very open about it um

1066
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,720
but i was also intentional with my use

1067
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,879
you know i wasn't aiming to get high i

1068
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:25,279
used very little um i worked on weekly

1069
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,240
using tinctures and tried to do as best

1070
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,119
as i could

1071
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,879
and uh but it didn't stop them from um

1072
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,400
sending in a

1073
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,720
social worker once i gave birth and i

1074
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,000
cannot tell you how terrifying it is to

1075
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,919
go through a 20-hour labor an emergency

1076
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,079
c-section to have someone come into your

1077
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,680
room then and interview you about your

1078
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,560
medical cannabis use

1079
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,519
um with a social worker right there um

1080
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,880
you think you're going to lose your

1081
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,559
child and this is something that's a

1082
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,039
really big issue whereas they didn't

1083
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,320
touch on us being at all for me that was

1084
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,320
not everything so you said it's kind of

1085
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,160
like a focus point whereas

1086
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,599
it was not even a concern the concern

1087
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,838
was you used cannabis during your

1088
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,240
pregnancy you told us you were using it

1089
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,159
we're going to test you in the kid if

1090
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,000
anything comes back positive

1091
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,598
we're going to have to take this and and

1092
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,760
see it through and i mind you i was in a

1093
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,920
legal state so and with doctor's

1094
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,359
permission so this is definitely a topic

1095
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,480
we need to touch on uh we need to

1096
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,719
protect our mothers out there because

1097
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,280
it is it is not easy uh to switch

1098
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,759
medicine and then mess up the

1099
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,920
already

1100
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,920
road raging hormones going on during

1101
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,800
pregnancy and then afterwards so um i

1102
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,559
think it's an important thing to

1103
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,119
highlight yeah and i want to know what

1104
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,119
the men think

1105
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,318
yeah well you know this this is

1106
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,480
absolutely uh you know

1107
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,639
when you listen to these stories it's

1108
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,358
it's a little bit uh it takes away your

1109
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,279
breath it's like why would you have to

1110
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,719
speak in front of a social worker after

1111
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,680
you gave birth when

1112
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,358
cannabis was helping you

1113
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,358
this is still part of the stigma is a

1114
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,639
part of the things that have to change

1115
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:05,119
and and again as

1116
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,879
viola was saying if the alternative is

1117
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,800
means of the hazard then we should

1118
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,280
really have a serious conversation i am

1119
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,760
totally in favor of you know defending

1120
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,319
and supporting women for their use

1121
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,000
absolutely

1122
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:18,800
the crazy thing to they've had to add is

1123
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,960
that

1124
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,119
both tests came back negative so they

1125
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,920
only had my admission so that's the

1126
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,000
thing

1127
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,039
they used my word against me so i

1128
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,880
thought that was pretty interesting for

1129
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,599
science sake though that nothing came

1130
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,599
back with positive

1131
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,200
did you guys want to add any last bit we

1132
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,199
have about four minutes

1133
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,639
do you well i think we're not going to

1134
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,039
ask questions does anyone have a

1135
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,039
question

1136
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,039
all right well that's one question

1137
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,039
let's hear

1138
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:03,599
yeah so just a quick question is

1139
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:06,719
in your opinion when it comes to germany

1140
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:11,280
how long will it be before you'll see in

1141
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,279
culture it becoming more accepted

1142
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,279
and i don't think that we will uh

1143
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,358
we will get it in our lifetime

1144
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,319
that we will sit it takes

1145
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,480
longer

1146
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,079
much longer

1147
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,280
yeah i can maybe share a quick

1148
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,519
experience in uruguay i was there in

1149
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,440
2015 so one year after they legalized

1150
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,199
and at that time even the people in the

1151
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,639
ministries so people working for the

1152
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,879
ministry of health the ministry of

1153
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,239
agriculture they were fighting it who

1154
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,000
had to sign

1155
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,078
the licenses because i you know it's

1156
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,119
legal but i i don't know maybe i lose my

1157
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,039
job

1158
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,559
and that takes a long time to to to to

1159
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,480
kind of change

1160
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,440
the good news is that nobody lost their

1161
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,480
job nobody died as we know cannabis is

1162
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,679
not going to kill you uh and so slowly

1163
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,679
there is a process of normalization but

1164
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,358
that that's what i was saying before the

1165
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,519
importance of getting together as a

1166
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,358
lobby you really look at alcohol and

1167
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,838
tobacco and they have hundreds of

1168
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:13,440
lawyers paid to go and defend the

1169
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,759
interest of the market the interest of

1170
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,679
the sector and we are still a little bit

1171
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,040
sometimes fighting against each other in

1172
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:22,799
a in a kind of too competitive way

1173
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,159
that's really one of the issues also so

1174
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,440
if you really want to change you have to

1175
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,519
go together

1176
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,159
convince the media convince the

1177
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,719
institutions uh you know break down all

1178
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:35,598
these issues like a social worker should

1179
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,199
not go and visit a mother the same day

1180
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,838
after she gave birth that's that's

1181
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,078
really that's human rights in my opinion

1182
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,920
that you're going again so that really

1183
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,720
is a little bit the

1184
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,960
the the soul of the problem i think

1185
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,118
and in general change comes because we

1186
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,280
talk about things so just

1187
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,400
being more aware in general these

1188
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,280
conferences

1189
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,480
add so much value in that sense

1190
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,680
yeah for example just um just an example

1191
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,079
from italy

1192
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,440
uh okay we have a medical law now almost

1193
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,079
a decade

1194
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,800
we the majority of doctors that we train

1195
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,280
there are over 50. why why is that

1196
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,640
because they are already in a safe place

1197
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,280
of their career

1198
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,838
okay the young doctors they don't want

1199
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,040
to know anything about cannabis

1200
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:22,318
so

1201
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,960
i think this

1202
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,759
it will change but it's a slow process

1203
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,318
and i and again the consciousness in my

1204
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,400
opinion comes from very different things

1205
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,639
one of these is education another thing

1206
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,400
is working this happens a lot in the

1207
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,440
czech republic for example you walk in a

1208
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,358
store and you see from the shampoo to

1209
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,440
everything with that cannabis leaf you

1210
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:46,159
know this starts to give different

1211
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,920
images so the grandmother starts to not

1212
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,239
completely go

1213
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,400
crazy if then the doctor is starting to

1214
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,399
talk to her about cannabis but yeah it

1215
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,119
will take a while and again the

1216
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,559
commitment of all of us as a united

1217
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,480
industry from all different aspects

1218
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,799
great thank you very much we're out of

1219
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,800
time let's hear it once again for

1220
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,800
fascinating
