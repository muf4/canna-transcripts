our r&amp;t department what is your

69
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,798
experience so so far regarding R&amp;D

70
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,000
projects and uh canab noise U

71
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,920
applications and um

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,759
formulations hello everyone good

73
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,798
afternoon yes that is correct um in

74
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,639
pharmahemp we have our own R&amp;D

75
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,519
department and we are also registered as

76
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,878
a research organization since

77
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,439
2018 um in total we have now five re

78
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:29,798
researchers working on different types

79
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:32,039
of R&amp;D projects and briefly I will

80
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,920
explain them and I will read a few of

81
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,959
them just to be sure not to misspell

82
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,359
them so the first project that was

83
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,878
co-founded by the EU was new generation

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,239
of hemp extracts for natural Cosmetics

85
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,359
which lasted for two years since

86
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,200
2018 then we had two projects which were

87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,599
performed in collaboration with mik Meda

88
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,238
Miko Meda is a Slovenian company that

89
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,598
produces medicinal mushrooms so the

90
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,200
first one was first food supplement

91
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:03,438
standardized to Arin a that lasted years

92
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,518
since 2020 and the second project was

93
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,280
sustainable production of standardized

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,000
food supplements from herian fungus this

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,719
one started in 2021 and lasted for two

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,680
years as well the last project is safety

97
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,720
evaluation of cannabid dials and

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,918
implications for public health and

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,080
consumers behavior shortly can save this

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,560
one is co-funded by Aris which is

101
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,439
Slovenian research agency and I will

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,399
just briefly represent some results and

103
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,319
the project um in this project uh in

104
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,679
total four different research

105
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,800
organizations are collaborating namely

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,319
National Institute of biology faculty of

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,400
Pharmacy and school of Economics from

108
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,759
University of lublana and pharmahemp is

109
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,918
an industrial partner in this project

110
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,120
which is I think I mentioned co-funded

111
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:57,639
by Aris so Slovenian research agency the

112
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,199
project has started in 2021 and it will

113
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,160
end by the end of this year

114
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:06,400
um we already have published results

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,360
from uh National Institute of biology

116
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,719
which uh showed that the Pharma hemp

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,720
studied isolated CBD and hemp extract

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,080
were both found non- genotoxic and also

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,319
the researchers confirmed that no DNA

120
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,000
damage was observed within the performed

121
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,680
Comet essay so another part of uh this

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,560
project is uh currently ongoing it's

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,400
performed by the school of economics

124
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,319
and they are uh uh basically examining

125
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,959
the public perception towards the use of

126
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,479
CBD different types of products in

127
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,399
Slovenia they're also trying to assess

128
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:48,000
the actual exposure to CBD products uh

129
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,679
from different consumer groups so this

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,079
is something that we are looking forward

131
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,560
to see uh and the results hopefully will

132
00:05:52,079 --> 00:06:00,599
be with us in the next few months thank

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,800
you um Sabina already mentioned your GMP

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,560
EU GMP license can you maybe tell us a

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,560
little bit more about that and um maybe

136
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,120
a little bit um uh what you're uh what

137
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,759
you're doing in this regard with the

138
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,399
manufacturing of

139
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,520
cannabis of course thank you good

140
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:22,239
afternoon everyone uh so at Argent barma

141
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,519
Argent barma in Slovenia is the at this

142
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,400
point of time the only manufacturing

143
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,120
facility that has an eug GMP certificate

144
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,879
issued by the health authorities of

145
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,079
Slovenia so the agency for medicinal

146
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,560
products and medical devices uh we have

147
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,359
a license to manufacture non-sterile

148
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,160
liquids uh for uh investig as

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,120
investigational medicinal product we are

150
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,080
aiming to also have a regular license

151
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,120
for regular medicinal products however

152
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:54,758
the Slovenian regulatory framework

153
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,439
doesn't allow us to upgrade our uh

154
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,319
certification in that sense because the

155
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,399
comment from the health authority is uh

156
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,240
usually that there is no legislation for

157
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,359
cannabis based products not even

158
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,519
medicinal products so that we need to

159
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,840
stay as investigational as a result uh

160
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,598
we are producing different medicinal

161
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,119
products that are our intellectual

162
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:19,959
property so our medicines or we can also

163
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,639
do custom based uh medicinal product

164
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:25,239
with custom range of different ratios of

165
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,759
CBD THC and others that we can then

166
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,160
Supply to other countries and other

167
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,360
markets where this is actually allowed

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,160
for further uh

169
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,038
treatment and not only this as uh maret

170
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,639
mentioned for Pharma Hamp also Argent

171
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,279
barma is also licensed for the from the

172
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,918
Ministry of Health to conduct research

173
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,478
on different cannabinoids uh what we

174
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,799
actually exploit in a sense that we also

175
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,318
support research with uh other

176
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,598
facilities institutional uh institutions

177
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,960
in Slovenia like nation National

178
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:01,319
Institute of biology with whom we worked

179
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,918
really closely but but also uh we do

180
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,439
research on our own products to

181
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,959
facilitate different clinical trials

182
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,759
what we as a company have sponsored in

183
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,318
different countries like in Australia uh

184
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,960
aiming to finish also in Israel and also

185
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,759
in the United States to show uh that our

186
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:24,519
products are true medicines and uh to in

187
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,280
the future to get them registered so

188
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,399
you're venturing into the global

189
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,359
pharmaceutical industry from Slovenia

190
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,718
basically for sure for sure um maybe

191
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,038
what kind of um other cannaboids are you

192
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,919
looking into other than THC and CBD so

193
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:44,080
uh firstly we were also in investigating

194
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:46,039
the CBG so um Professor Tamar Al we have

195
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,240
cooperated with her in the formulation

196
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,679
was prepared from my colleagues from the

197
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,080
R&amp;D Department that were supplying it to

198
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:55,519
the National Institute where they were

199
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,440
actually investigating the positive

200
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,320
outcomes on the glioblastoma so we are

201
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,800
open for uh every opportunity that comes

202
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,640
for different combinations that we can

203
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:12,319
then enforce but for now we are mostly

204
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:14,838
concentrated in uh CBD uh CBG THC and

205
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,079
also the full spectrum extract that we

206
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,480
have been now for more than one year

207
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:23,039
supplying to the ukat so the medical

208
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,320
center of lublana we are also closely

209
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,639
working with the Pediatric Clinic

210
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,399
unfortunately we were not able to

211
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,838
prepare a medicine like like an oil that

212
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,320
would be then prescribed directly for

213
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:39,560
patients but we are supplying the API so

214
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,120
the raw extract that is then uh further

215
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:44,639
processed in the pharmacy thank you very

216
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,159
much um Daniel let's move move over to

217
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,319
you um how is Laurel Crest participating

218
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,600
in medicinal uh studies and R&amp;D of

219
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,760
cannabinoid medicine and for which

220
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,959
products which products do you think are

221
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,039
particularly interesting to

222
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,078
investigate thank you for having me good

223
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,199
afterno afternoon um so Laurel Crest is

224
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,359
a primarily an ingredient producer in

225
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,640
the United States so we are actually

226
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,240
producing CBG isolates CBD uh full

227
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,480
spectrum extracts and working with

228
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,799
different um countries which is part of

229
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,320
the reason that I'm here but all over

230
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,919
the world and researchers on

231
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,879
formulations that are going into

232
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,599
pre-clinical trials or for instance

233
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:31,000
something we're currently working on in

234
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,560
Japan is

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,559
uh people who failed the GW

236
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,799
Pharmaceutical trials are going into a

237
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,439
trial with a full spectrum extract that

238
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,838
we're providing and going to see how

239
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,200
that that works in a clinical study and

240
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,959
so we're also providing the platform um

241
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,440
which is less formal than what we're

242
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,119
talking about here and like to the

243
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,320
medical Market but a a platform to

244
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,839
basically analyze data and at least be

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,600
able to

246
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,360
offer what's happening for these

247
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,360
patients that didn't have success with

248
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,399
the pure isolate and the difference

249
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,000
between that and a full spectrum product

250
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,519
so expanding opportunities in that way

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,759
and then also full control of the

252
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,600
ingredients going into these

253
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:19,078
formulations and I think an exciting

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,519
expansion is tpin um and so also working

255
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,799
with some of the leading tpine

256
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,839
researchers and and doing combinations

257
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,240
of Turpin to see how that improves uh

258
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,040
the efficacy of different formulas wow

259
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,120
that's super interesting

260
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,039
so uh let's talk a little bit uh about

261
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,240
the public perception of cannabis um and

262
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,679
also in um how this uh interacts with

263
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,079
research and development ma um public

264
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,838
perception is uh varying very much from

265
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,278
person to person from individual

266
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,720
experience from many levels um how do

267
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:53,720
you address misconceptions and concerns

268
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,240
about canabo based therapies and what

269
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,000
role does public education and also like

270
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,919
uh to a certain extent registration of

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,278
specific Health claims or looking to

272
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,559
register for uh specific medical

273
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:10,720
indications play in this

274
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,879
discussion yeah we've talked about the

275
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,879
health claims actually a few years ago

276
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,198
now uh it is true that we've uh applied

277
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:22,039
for the authorization of a health claim

278
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:24,958
related to CBD uh to which could be

279
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:28,159
stated somehow like CBD reduces the

280
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,638
stress induced anxiety uh but of course

281
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:33,919
the authorities have not responded yet

282
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,480
in any way up until now so we have no no

283
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,120
answer from EC and FSA on this topic but

284
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,959
that's the same for novel food right

285
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,560
yeah novel food is relatively the same I

286
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,919
mean we've heard before that aha is very

287
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:51,078
successful in their toxicity studies on

288
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,599
on in clinical trial basically uh at the

289
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:56,319
moment at farahan we put this project on

290
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,199
whole because of the the really high

291
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
investment you probably all know that

292
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,879
clinical trials are very very expensive

293
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,199
and we've got we've received the same

294
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,000
request from ifsa like everybody else

295
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:10,479
who got validated in the EC that is

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,679
performed the additional animal testing

297
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,399
along with the one that we already did

298
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,399
plus clinical trials so it's really a

299
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,919
big thing that will or not happen we'll

300
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
see yeah but but don't you think it's

301
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,879
strange that a lot of people are using

302
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,000
CBD products and it's actually publicly

303
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,679
available as a food supplement in many

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,278
cases and we know about certain risks

305
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,159
and it's still so much so many barriers

306
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,919
in there whereas it would be easy thing

307
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:38,278
to just put some R risk thresholds or

308
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,078
find some individual regulation is that

309
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:41,759
also something that you're lobbying like

310
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,879
when you're or that you're when when

311
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,000
you're addressing concerns for cannabis

312
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,159
yeah it's it's hard to actually comment

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,078
this but you can see that that reality

314
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,480
here and not only in Slovenia but I

315
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:56,000
think the whole Europe is that everybody

316
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,839
sells CBDs food supplements and the

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,278
authorities are actually not really

318
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,759
responding I mean they do there are some

319
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:06,679
cases available on rapex system I think

320
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,560
notification system is in in Europe and

321
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,278
you can see there are some notifications

322
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,919
that there was a re re removal of the

323
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,360
food supplement containing CBD because

324
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,759
of the I don't know the excess of THC

325
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,919
and something like this but uh when you

326
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,560
see the the market is still flooded with

327
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:25,799
this kind of products so you know one is

328
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:28,599
theory and the other as as Cosmetics

329
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,559
that are like just declared as Cosmetics

330
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,040
um SA let's jump over to you maybe you

331
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,559
can walk us a little bit through the

332
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,278
regulatory landscape here in Slovenia

333
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,599
and um when it comes to the treatment

334
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:41,278
with cannabis and what should change

335
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,360
here in or what should be improved or um

336
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,439
changed and uh yeah how is the

337
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,600
experience here different with in your

338
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,480
experience in other markets okay uh so

339
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,720
um as maretta said we have a lot of

340
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,759
products on the shelves that are um

341
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,879
Cosmetics but are used as food

342
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,278
supplements yeah

343
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,439
this is uh yeah this is some kind of

344
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:07,879
let's say how you avoid some regulatory

345
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,160
obstacles but this products let's say

346
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:13,439
primarily are not intended for treatment

347
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,360
so usually for treatment of different

348
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,680
symptoms or uh diseases medicinal

349
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,120
products are used so as I mentioned

350
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:24,919
before what is also an obstacle for us

351
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,679
as a GMP license manufacturing site is

352
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,599
that we don't have any concrete

353
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:31,519
regulatory framework when it comes to

354
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,600
cannabis based medicinal products uh

355
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,240
this is also I mean um it's very

356
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,600
limiting how to bring products to the

357
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,360
Slovenian market and not only how to

358
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,519
bring products to Slovenian Market if I

359
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,759
if we produce it as a company for other

360
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,600
markets is also a difficulty to export

361
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:53,159
them so uh the thing is that in Slovenia

362
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,440
cannabis-based treatments are usually

363
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:59,519
allowed as magistral medicines meaning

364
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,759
that the pharmacy can order a

365
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,560
so active pharmaceutical ingredients

366
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,440
these are ingredients cannabinoids of

367
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:11,119
any sort that need to be uh manufactured

368
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,000
in an eug GMP facility so in a facility

369
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,639
that is producing according to the

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,720
guidelines for medicinal products so not

371
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,839
nutraceuticals this really needs to be

372
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,519
pointed out and these apis are then

373
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,319
supplied to the pharmacy and Pharmacy

374
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,240
according to the prescription of the

375
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,439
prescribing doctor prepares a

376
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,959
formulation

377
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,480
these formulations are in Slovenia also

378
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:38,838
in the health insurance system so this

379
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,680
um this ratios need to be approved also

380
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:46,480
by the sector of the pH Pharm

381
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:49,278
pharmacists of Slovenia uh and these are

382
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,560
the only ones that are also reimbursed

383
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,679
that the doctors can prescribe uh so

384
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:58,239
this is very limiting because we don't

385
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,838
uh we as patients for instance don't

386
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,439
have many options into getting the

387
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,880
medicine that you want uh and also it's

388
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,720
limiting for the industry in a sense

389
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,839
that we can produce different medicinal

390
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,959
products that can be offered that will

391
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,438
ease the life of the doctors of the

392
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,000
pharmacies and so on but since there is

393
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,720
no regulation we cannot work anything

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,359
through we uh I can share an experience

395
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,640
that we have at Argent biofarma that the

396
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,359
pharmacy actually approached us the

397
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,240
pharmacy that they wanted us to produce

398
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,599
the oils from for them because um I'm

399
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,880
not sure how many you have experience

400
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,038
with full spectrum cannabis extract but

401
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,559
these are very viscous and very hard to

402
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,240
work with uh and you need to have let's

403
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,480
say uh a bit of experience to work with

404
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,000
them to dissolve them and so on and also

405
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
not to compromise the quality of the

406
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,720
extract because we still want the canab

407
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,280
nids to be there and we went together to

408
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,159
the agency to ask for the permission and

409
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,319
constantly we get a no because there is

410
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,080
no legislation

411
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,720
and then we are constantly in circles

412
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,079
and it's a shame because in Slovenia I

413
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,038
believe we have a lot of knowhow from

414
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:15,000
different companies we have a lot of

415
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:17,558
comp uh um a lot of uh how they say a

416
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,679
lot of uh openness yeah and

417
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,359
collaboration with different uh

418
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,840
institutions with healthc Care

419
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,759
Professionals between us in the business

420
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,199
so business to business we have with

421
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,158
different markets and instead of us

422
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,720
being a set we are waiting for others to

423
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,080
have a trend and then we follow and we

424
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,759
have also very good experience at Argent

425
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,480
we are supplying our medicines to

426
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,839
Ireland Following also on the last

427
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,798
question in Ireland you have a medicinal

428
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,519
cannabis Access program that they uh

429
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,720
have published three different

430
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,759
indications for which the doctors can

431
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,839
prescribe the medicinal cannabis

432
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,839
medicine so our the product needs to go

433
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,639
through an evaluation at the health

434
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,720
authority so not everyone and every

435
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,120
company that produces something can get

436
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,640
there so you need to show your quality

437
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,158
consistency that you are an eug GMP

438
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,320
certified site and then this product is

439
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,760
also fully reimbursed by the health

440
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,519
authority and the doctors can prescribe

441
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,480
them and there are several products that

442
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,359
you can pick from so that you can also

443
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,919
treat the patient and this is really

444
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,359
limiting in Slovenia and it's high time

445
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,640
that we move forward in this sense it's

446
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,639
holding also back economic potential for

447
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,120
sure for sure

448
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,320
um so Danielle let's jump back over to

449
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:37,279
you um where do you see the great

450
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,119
greatest expansion potential um and for

451
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,558
cannabis and plant-based medicine

452
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,879
research and how do you think this will

453
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:47,359
affect the long uh in the long term also

454
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,039
the consumers and uh patients maybe also

455
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,599
in addition to that yeah um so I'm

456
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,640
coming from a slightly different

457
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:59,079
perspective um than the more medical

458
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,679
route in the sense that um

459
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,119
it's like the thing that still keeps it

460
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,640
very inspiring is that these products

461
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:09,079
change lives and they're very uh it's

462
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,038
still kind of a word of mouth industry

463
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:14,439
strangely where your speech this morning

464
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,879
is very moving where parents find that

465
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,080
this really helps and then they tell

466
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,559
another parent and then it becomes a

467
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,359
larger circle of people who believe in

468
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,639
the medicine because they see that it is

469
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,000
really working and it's changing the

470
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,320
lives of the people that they love and

471
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,960
so uh how do you bring that patient it's

472
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,000
not really a patient Network as much as

473
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,240
it is like a community of people who

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,279
really want to see these accessible to

475
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,519
more people who are experiencing

476
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,119
whatever hardship or disease state or

477
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,480
you know mental stress whatever it is

478
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:52,158
for the people around them and so using

479
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,960
these patient groups or these Community

480
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,960
groups to collect data around

481
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,159
formulations that can be maybe

482
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,159
formulated in a medical setting or

483
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,960
formulated like at Laurel Crest you know

484
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,960
where we're working with uh doctors to

485
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,919
create the formulations based on their

486
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,798
research and applying it to a community

487
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,240
group that wants to also be a part of

488
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,879
the advocacy and so the data is less

489
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,679
formal than a than a expensive clinical

490
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,880
trial but it's still data that's showing

491
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,278
that these things work and you can kind

492
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,919
of it depends on the group that you're

493
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,079
working with but you can cross into you

494
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,480
know like or rings and different kinds

495
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:36,119
of ways to measure how this is treating

496
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,839
or improving something or maybe not

497
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,759
working so that you can improve the

498
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,678
formulation and so it's like I think

499
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,798
that these all of the work that we're

500
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,240
doing is super important to continue to

501
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,240
get the message out there that this uh

502
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,200
is a safe alternative to some of the

503
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,880
pharmaceutical ingredient you know some

504
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,679
of the pharmaceutical things that are

505
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,880
prescribed all the time that are ruining

506
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,960
people's lives um and so that's kind of

507
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,960
that's where Laurel Crest sits there

508
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,679
because we're we're really not in the

509
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,480
United States we do not have to have the

510
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,200
level of compliance that you do in in

511
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,720
Europe but

512
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,319
we're working towards that to

513
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,200
participate in the World Market FDA is

514
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,319
going more against it recently and

515
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,319
they're also looking to standardize more

516
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,599
right like I I mean we are built for

517
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:29,038
compliance so we are hoping we would

518
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:31,359
love the FDA to say something and and do

519
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,558
anything it would be very helpful to

520
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,719
Laurel Crest and companies like us that

521
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,319
are built to to Really stay within the

522
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,079
regulatory like escalation of the market

523
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,200
yeah but I think it's interesting to see

524
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,278
if you compare like for the audience to

525
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,519
compare the last two answers yeah like

526
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:48,440
from from the ladies you can see how

527
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,038
this is the conundrum that we are in

528
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,080
yeah at the one hand you just have the

529
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:53,759
consumers who are really who want the

530
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,278
products who are pushing for initiative

531
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,798
who are taking the governments to courts

532
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:59,359
and then you have the government and the

533
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:00,558
government they don't want to react

534
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,759
because they're scared of making

535
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,639
something wrong but you have the experts

536
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,278
there who could help build those

537
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,480
Frameworks and these ecosystems so it's

538
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,079
something uh interesting I think that

539
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,519
just comes out of that those two answers

540
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:18,038
because it shows the contrast yeah true

541
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,519
so uh Marita let's jump back over to you

542
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:23,640
um what about the future do you already

543
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:26,519
have new plans for R&amp;D projects sure

544
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,960
like always yes it is true we are all

545
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,720
constantly developing new new products

546
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
new

547
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,720
technologies and for sure I can mention

548
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,520
one Milestone that happened just

549
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,919
recently we signed a memorandum of

550
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,519
cooperation with the tnl company uh tnl

551
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,640
company is a South Korean based company

552
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,158
that produces various types of polymer

553
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,278
based Technologies uh which are

554
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,640
basically final products like cosmetics

555
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:58,519
and medicinal products um so together

556
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,400
with tnl we are developing at the moment

557
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,400
new type of patches that will be infused

558
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,440
with

559
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,480
CBD and uh uh the thing is that the

560
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,519
operational date of the production

561
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,038
facility which will be in maribor is

562
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,319
planned for the second half of 2025 so

563
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:20,960
by then hopefully we'll start producing

564
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:23,480
the Innovative CBD patches which will be

565
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,759
very beneficial for the treatment of

566
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:30,159
acne yes interesting um and What markets

567
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:34,200
are new are you going into zabina are

568
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,039
new and exciting for you uh so the most

569
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,278
exciting Market would be Slovenia of

570
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,480
course but but we will still need to

571
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:46,079
wait a little

572
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,278
bit uh yeah so we are um exploring as I

573
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,038
mentioned Ireland and we would also

574
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,880
expand our portfolio in the Irish Market

575
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:57,119
because Ireland is now also looking into

576
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,159
adding pain as an indication for

577
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,599
treatment with cannabis based medicinal

578
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:05,039
product we are also present in the UK uh

579
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:07,918
for the treatment of epilepsy so

580
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,480
refractory epilepsy what uh we are now

581
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,960
also planning to broaden our portfolio

582
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,079
with one of our also Flagship products

583
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,319
uh but for the treatment of Parkinson

584
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,639
disease so we are actually planning to

585
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,119
now cooperate with one Clinic that has

586
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,759
200 patients so that we could also see

587
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,199
the benefits in the treatment of

588
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:31,119
symptoms that are uh connected with the

589
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,960
Parkinson's uh um also non-u Market

590
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,719
markets are really interesting

591
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,960
especially Brazil what we all know so

592
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,079
Brazil also did some changes in the

593
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,519
legislation whereas you cannot just

594
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,439
bring a canes based product into the

595
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:48,440
market it needs to go through a sanitary

596
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,519
authorization which is something similar

597
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,120
as a traditional herbal medicine in EU

598
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,720
we have been present in Australia but we

599
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,839
not sure whether we would stay there we

600
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,720
would mostly like also to focus in the

601
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,319
US I think there is a big potential so

602
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:08,240
we are working very closely with the FDA

603
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:10,639
to also um go over some bridges there

604
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,079
and to bring the products there so

605
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,120
unfortunately Slovenia has a big

606
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:18,678
interest of ours but we don't see

607
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,000
anything happening in the near future so

608
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:24,519
we are exploring other markets globally

609
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,159
that's super interesting um also for for

610
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,839
the states like especially for the

611
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,200
medicines part there not so much if you

612
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,079
really look at it like from the

613
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,558
standardized like National available

614
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,359
kind of things maybe you can also tell

615
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:39,359
us a little bit for because it's your

616
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:41,879
home Market um about uh and um how you

617
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:45,158
looking to get more access there on a

618
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,360
national safe and compliant level and um

619
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:52,000
how what kind of international markets

620
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:56,240
are exciting for you yeah the US is a

621
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,440
confusing Market um because there is so

622
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,079
much gray space in in the Market at the

623
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,120
moment and until the FDA says something

624
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:08,798
publicly it seems like it'll remain and

625
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:12,479
then also with elections coming up there

626
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,679
is no farm bill um no new farm bill and

627
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
so that kind

628
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,559
of maintains the status quo of a lot of

629
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,159
gray space and so uh the

630
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:25,798
majority of our work is really in the

631
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,520
therapeutic molecules and so we see that

632
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,519
continue to be added into different

633
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,480
formulations worldwide so that's

634
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,440
expanding throughout the US it's being

635
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
added into cannabis in the regulated

636
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,399
market state to state where you're

637
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,480
complementing THC with CBG and CBC and

638
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:43,119
CBN for different uh effect-based

639
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,798
products so we're seeing a lot of

640
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,359
expansion there um and then our largest

641
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,798
expansion this year is a distribution

642
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,398
center in Japan and so working really

643
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:56,918
closely with a patient Network there who

644
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,079
advocated really strongly to raise there

645
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,240
was recently laws Japan that we're going

646
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:05,079
to change the uh THC limits to one part

647
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,880
per million they've now advocated for 10

648
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,960
parts per million which is just a little

649
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,000
bit better uh but this patient Network

650
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,200
we've been actually working with for

651
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,798
five years providing product to this

652
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,640
group and so they're really working with

653
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:20,679
them to Advocate to continue to be able

654
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,880
to serve that group of people and so

655
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,320
that's an exciting project that's kind

656
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,159
of becoming more realized as the

657
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:32,038
regulations are changing and the

658
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,240
Japanese group um this patient group is

659
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,839
uh being more vocal about their rights

660
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,839
to to Super interesting especially

661
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,038
because Japanese uh the Japanese Market

662
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:45,759
are super anti anti- THC yeah so I mean

663
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:48,839
it all is anti- THC um they are allowing

664
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,558
this one formulation to come in to see

665
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:53,158
but it's almost like honestly it's

666
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,440
almost like they made a mistake and said

667
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,278
we're going to do do you know what I

668
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,798
mean oops Yeah but I mean and that's

669
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,278
what's interesting think about all the

670
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,759
markets and learning today about more

671
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:05,000
about EU GMP and what it would take for

672
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,599
Laurel Crest to become EU and GMP what

673
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,079
that really means like you're everywhere

674
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:10,959
that I go I feel like I'm learning

675
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,398
something else and also no one's really

676
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,640
sure what's going to happen and so we're

677
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,479
expanding as we can you know we've been

678
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,600
we've shipped product into uh Ghana um

679
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,839
South

680
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:28,480
America um just opening things as it

681
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:32,558
becomes available and yeah thank you um

682
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,679
so I think um goo yeah how many do we

683
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:38,678
still have time for Quest you can talk

684
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:42,559
all you want we have 40 minutes left

685
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,519
14 questions oh okay yeah I don't know

686
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,119
like uh doubt it gives us a little bit

687
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,599
like I didn't expect to be uh over that

688
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,199
early I didn't have a Time on so great

689
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,599
yeah let's hear let's hear for them

690
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,600
they're doing

691
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,399
[Applause]

692
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,240
great um yeah then maybe we keep the

693
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,518
discussion five more minutes on stage

694
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,120
and then um question yeah and then two

695
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:09,759
questions yeah okay um so let's keep the

696
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:11,439
discussion a little bit more on stage

697
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,480
but it just I think it's super

698
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,120
interesting to see like all your

699
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,960
different experiences and what uh what

700
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:21,119
you're doing on a local level and how

701
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,079
we're all doing our jobs to bring the

702
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,239
puzzle pieces together um maybe a

703
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,798
question to all of you what do you think

704
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,278
should be done and could be done also by

705
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:34,119
us by Regulators or maybe also by

706
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:35,640
getting patient engaged and those kind

707
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,319
of initiative what should be what should

708
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,200
happen more that uh in order to get a

709
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,798
more harmonized um framework maybe

710
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,440
Sabina St with you what should what

711
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,639
should change there in that

712
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,558
regard good

713
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:55,120
question so uh firstly what um so I

714
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,720
worked in a regular uh pharmaceutical

715
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:01,719
industry so I have been uh in qu

716
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,880
for more than 10 years and I came to

717
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,240
Argent biofarma entering a

718
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,000
pharmaceutical industry connected with

719
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,159
cannabis so for me if you are a GMP uh

720
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
manufacturer and if you produce medicine

721
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,200
you produce medicine you know it's

722
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,440
effective you know it's safe uh

723
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,720
compliant and you just give it and when

724
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,960
I started my colleagues that are also

725
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,440
here were constantly telling me Sabina

726
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,720
it's not that easy how it's not easy we

727
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,558
have their opioids it's easy you give

728
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,240
them you distribute them and so on and I

729
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:37,200
noticed that the biggest obstacle is

730
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,839
education so people don't know a lot a

731
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,360
lot about it um the problem then second

732
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:47,678
education I mean also um from the Health

733
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:50,278
Care system to the Regulatory and then

734
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,320
also to patients consumers that are

735
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:56,480
mixing also food supplements treatments

736
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:59,319
THC with CBD and so on and I think this

737
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,440
is the biggest obstacle that we have uh

738
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:06,200
and this is our let's say responsibility

739
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,080
in a sense we um I can say in my company

740
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,000
we really work closely with doctors with

741
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:14,558
institutions with clinics for this

742
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,798
purpose to educate also we educate our

743
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,678
business partners because a lot of times

744
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,638
we get a lot of offers that are

745
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,960
connected with CBD THC and then we also

746
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:27,079
need to educate the difference of

747
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:31,000
medicinal product food supplement uh

748
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:34,278
treatment daily intake for supplementing

749
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,638
food and so on so I think this is uh the

750
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:38,398
first thing where we should start is

751
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:40,479
with the

752
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,759
education Danielle what do you think it

753
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,839
should be um done more like especially

754
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,558
because you talked about the US and the

755
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,759
different uh markets and I know you have

756
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:53,798
the same situation like we do here with

757
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:56,519
the hhc Delta 8 Delta 10 that are maybe

758
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:58,879
often times also used um in a medic

759
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,359
medicinal context but are only available

760
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,880
as a commercial product without the

761
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:08,719
proper help by the for for Education as

762
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,679
you say is important but um uh let's uh

763
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,200
what do you think should be better I

764
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,240
mean I do think that in the US

765
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,880
specifically it would be really helpful

766
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,359
if the FDA would come out and say

767
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,200
something so that at least manufacturing

768
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,798
had to meet certain standards um for

769
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,240
Laurel Crest for example we're a GMP

770
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:29,720
facility we're our infrastructure is

771
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,880
built to go up into pharmaceutical if we

772
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,038
needed to but we are doing that out of

773
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,000
like a desire to be a leader in the

774
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,798
industry not because we have to and so

775
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,480
we're self-regulating based on our

776
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:47,480
ethics not on any regulatory body that's

777
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,558
telling us that we need to be making the

778
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,000
products in an environment that you

779
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:57,278
would want any you know medicine to come

780
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,079
out of um and so that would be great and

781
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:02,200
then also just Community forums I mean

782
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,359
like this like your network Empower

783
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,639
women's cannabis you know is it's really

784
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:11,078
important for everyone to be

785
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:14,759
communicating and also linked in the

786
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:17,519
collective movement towards normalizing

787
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,200
hemp and cannabis or this amazing

788
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,519
magical plant that we are brings us

789
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,759
together and not having it be so much

790
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,878
about like how much money you're going

791
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,679
to make all the time because we have

792
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:29,918
seen that that also is isn't really a

793
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,800
lasting

794
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:37,878
motivator you know um so yeah I think

795
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,760
that the continued community and

796
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:41,759
conversation is one thing that's super

797
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,560
important and then more more regulation

798
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,639
in the US would be really nice because

799
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,279
we could guarantee that even if you are

800
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,878
making hhc or d8 or all of these

801
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,679
different products that have kind of

802
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:54,199
poured out of CBD isolate in the in the

803
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,800
last years

804
00:34:54,199 --> 00:35:01,358
to kind of the the farm bill allowed a a

805
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,880
big definition of what hemp is and what

806
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,400
is derived from

807
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,200
hemp it would be great if those were all

808
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,079
being made in facilities that were safe

809
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:12,679
um but across the globe more like that

810
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,880
is maybe you can add to that Maya like

811
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:17,399
because you are active in with uh

812
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,960
ingredients in different uh standards of

813
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,599
identity what should be the thing that

814
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,440
should happen on the European level but

815
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,440
also on a global scale so we can get

816
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,440
more harmonized and standardized also

817
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,320
Frameworks where we as entrepreneurs can

818
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,079
then

819
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,079
act um it's hard to get a global picture

820
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,400
or to harmonize everything I think we've

821
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,839
discussed this earlier with the with the

822
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,480
within one of the topics but I would

823
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:46,480
relate to to Sabina um and I think that

824
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,559
the education is a very very um

825
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,880
important thing here one is we need to

826
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,078
educate the doctors because I think

827
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,000
there's still lack of knowledge when it

828
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:58,800
comes to cannabis based

829
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,679
therapies uh one fact is for example

830
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,800
that on medicinal school at the

831
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:07,279
University of lublana the program still

832
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,880
doesn't contain any kind of uh uh

833
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,400
cannabinoids or cannabis based therapy

834
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,200
so people that basically finish the

835
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,240
medical school have no knowledge about

836
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,399
the already existing medicines that are

837
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:24,159
possibly to be prescribed in Slovenia

838
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,240
and I think this is a big issue um

839
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,679
another is the education of the people

840
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:32,358
so of the patients to enable them to use

841
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:34,199
safely and effectively anything that's

842
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:37,279
related to cannabinoids because people

843
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:39,519
are still using a lot of garage stuff

844
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,359
which I think is very bad and this is

845
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,838
something that needs to be changed with

846
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,400
an ongoing communication with a clear

847
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:50,039
communication for example at faham we

848
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,000
took some steps to to try to at least uh

849
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:56,279
raise awareness um I've participated in

850
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,920
an interview on Med overnet which is a

851
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,599
well-known platform in IIA then we had

852
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,159
an open for where people could

853
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,079
anonymously ask any kind of questions

854
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:10,480
that are related to cannabinoids and Med

855
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,839
cannabis therapies and our scientific uh

856
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,559
advisor Professor Stosich was there to

857
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,559
uh respond to all of those questions

858
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,519
they are still there it was about 50

859
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:22,119
questions from basically everyone and I

860
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,880
think this is the way that everybody

861
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:29,079
should do it and in this manner we will

862
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,920
come to to Better World yeah I have one

863
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,160
other thing is um because I was touring

864
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,000
Pharma hemp and they have an amazing uh

865
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,759
testing facility which I'm sure that you

866
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,800
do too with hlc's and all these things

867
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,599
but standardization of testing is

868
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,079
probably the biggest hurdle to the US

869
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,318
market at the moment you can get a test

870
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,920
on your product and you get it back from

871
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,759
four different labs and it's for

872
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,920
different completely different tests and

873
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,280
so something that is standardizing how

874
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,960
reading these ingredients would be from

875
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,280
a worldwide perspective really helpful

876
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,280
yeah I think uh but if you look at the

877
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,280
picture of these developments especially

878
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,920
surrounding CBD I don't know in Europe

879
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,560
to me at least it feels a little bit

880
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,400
like we're in a still standand

881
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,719
especially with all the food regulations

882
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,480
and the novel food application and back

883
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,039
in

884
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,280
2019 I think it was when it was decided

885
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:27,679
that CBD is not a drug

886
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,680
basically there you could already see

887
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:34,559
some movement against these recreational

888
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,078
users or lifestyle users but still it's

889
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,880
just like there's a roadblock and

890
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,440
there's no solution to it and there is

891
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,240
also No Sol no willingness to release

892
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,800
this roadblock and I think um it would

893
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,519
be a possibility to create more

894
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,318
harmonized rules because we have like

895
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:52,880
different rules for CBD in the

896
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:55,239
Netherlands in Germany in France some

897
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,680
have special things yeah and it's not so

898
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:58,519
difficult that we can use the science

899
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,519
and data I bet you have security

900
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:01,519
thresholds or don't

901
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:08,118
you all right um so let's open the FL

902
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,279
for questions yes yes let let's he for

903
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,519
the panel one more time we're going to

904
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,800
start here we're going to go

905
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,800
there check

906
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:21,440
check yeah hello can you hear me is it

907
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,280
working

908
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,800
yeah louder uh I have one question you

909
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,680
in one moment uh Danielle mentioned in

910
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,480
uh Japan and their

911
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:35,440
regulations uh do you maybe have some

912
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,079
insights about their um regulations

913
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,119
about the CBD and the source of CBD

914
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,760
because now it's really funny that they

915
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,640
accept CBD only if it's sourced if it's

916
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,880
extracted from the uh not from the

917
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,039
leaves not from the flower just from the

918
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,599
stalk and

919
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,920
root is there do do you maybe have some

920
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,800
info about that is is is it going in

921
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,639
some different direction it I mean just

922
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,280
like maybe two days

923
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:04,879
ago it is starting to go in another

924
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,400
Direction and it was acknowledged that

925
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,160
that is Antiquated definition but that

926
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,960
definition is going back to I mean it's

927
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:19,440
it's a it's a very very old definition

928
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,800
of hemp and related to fiber and so it

929
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,159
just never changed for many many years

930
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,599
and with these new regulations it seems

931
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,838
they're not going to require those

932
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,200
statements anymore anymore um which

933
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:32,679
obviously if you were importing into

934
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,719
Japan and making those statements we

935
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:38,440
know that it

936
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:43,118
was not true um and so that

937
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:45,920
uh I do feel like there is a shift in

938
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,318
Japan and at the same time the parts per

939
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,838
million the THC parts per million is

940
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,318
extremely limiting and extremely

941
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:57,039
difficult to accomplish and

942
00:40:53,318 --> 00:41:00,800
also analyze analyze yeah and so part of

943
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:02,599
the testing like the I mean depending on

944
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,440
what lab you go to you could get the

945
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,359
thing that you want or not and there's

946
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,079
no standard there so do you think it's

947
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:10,559
like a form of uh prohibition through

948
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:13,800
overregulation

949
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,759
uh I don't think that I don't think that

950
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,359
the country is comfortable with THC in

951
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:26,240
any at all like it's very uncomfortable

952
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:28,318
with it and so yes and it's not 100%

953
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,559
different and there's kind of like this

954
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,358
portal through this patient group where

955
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,559
they're not wanting to also hurt their

956
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,519
citizens so I don't know it's changing

957
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,440
every day I get like a WhatsApp text

958
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,239
being like hey this is the new this is

959
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,000
the new thought so I think that it's

960
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,639
really it's it's kind of a dynamic

961
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,480
situation and they're not planning to

962
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,559
say anything def definite and for a

963
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,440
couple more months so it could continue

964
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:57,078
to shift but the an the analization of

965
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,838
10 parts per million as a limit for THC

966
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:02,440
is is going to be very difficult to

967
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:03,880
consistently achieve By Any Lab but it's

968
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,800
in it's an interesting aspect we have

969
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,039
the same situation in Germany I'm on the

970
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,200
German Board of the industry Association

971
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,480
and German industry Association I was

972
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,318
for a long term also responsible for the

973
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,400
CBD part and we had a couple of cases

974
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,719
where there were CBD products um with

975
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,559
full spectrum extract cosmetics and they

976
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,838
said you're going against the single

977
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,760
convention on narcotics this is clearly

978
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,920
your drug dealers and they did creams

979
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,119
for putting on your skin so clearly

980
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,920
they're not drug dealers and uh so those

981
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,800
kind of situations evolved but in my

982
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,039
opinion those are rooted in the single

983
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,559
convention in in a outdated and wrong

984
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,039
definition because you just mentioned

985
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,400
the stalks um those of you who know the

986
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,679
plant know that there are little

987
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,720
tricomes even to the smallest level or

988
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:49,558
on the sugar leaves and all those kind

989
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:51,399
of things so I am personally lobbying to

990
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,480
change the definition and to get the

991
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,039
update in the single convention for

992
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,358
these definitions because they're just

993
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,039
not right it's just technically wrong

994
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:03,358
do we have more

995
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:06,239
questions yes um thank you very much and

996
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:09,039
uh I have a some question my name is IIA

997
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,639
Resnik I'm a psychiatrist and director

998
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,880
of International Association of

999
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:17,400
cannabinoid medicine several years ago

1000
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:21,000
we made some research what is wrong with

1001
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,358
CBD oil it was it had been published uh

1002
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,159
uh where we collected the samples from

1003
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:31,598
the 20s pharmacies where the and OTC

1004
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:36,440
sources where the CBD oil uh had been

1005
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:40,359
sold and we we made assessment in Len um

1006
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:43,280
laboratory using hlc in order to compare

1007
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:45,880
what doesn't uh indicated on the label

1008
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,760
and what is real content we found that

1009
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,318
more than 50% of the labels were faked H

1010
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,400
more than 50% contained even more

1011
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:58,920
concentration majority less but some uh

1012
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,400
samples had there low more concentration

1013
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:05,800
that it had been indicated so we suppose

1014
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:09,480
that no control really plowed to this

1015
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,079
area so how we can calculate it using in

1016
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,199
my clinical practice in clinical

1017
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,000
practice in Germany other countries

1018
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,879
where the OTC no nobody checked it

1019
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,400
really please may I

1020
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,559
respond um I suppose this was taken from

1021
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,079
Slovenian

1022
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:28,079
pharmacies if I may ask

1023
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,160
meaning dogies like d droger

1024
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:36,519
Market in Slovenia was it in Israel or

1025
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:42,199
where did you take

1026
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:45,159
them where ah from Israel ahuh Germany

1027
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:50,318
was it with the one with the CBD LMA ah

1028
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:54,759
I misunderstood this okay um so firstly

1029
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:57,400
um hlc even though it's um high

1030
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,040
performance liquid chromatography

1031
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:04,680
it can show varying results if the

1032
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:07,960
method is not uh qualified and validated

1033
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:09,759
so if we have oils in different matrixes

1034
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,280
and different matrixes and different

1035
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,680
ingredients inside and if this is not

1036
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:19,200
brought to the highest level this can

1037
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:23,239
also be uh a reason that the results

1038
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,078
are not as what is uh on the label we

1039
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:28,199
had also an experience when the

1040
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,839
Institute YF Stefan took one of our

1041
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:34,358
extracts in oil and their results were

1042
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,639
drastically different from the result of

1043
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:39,119
our laboratory that has a validated

1044
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,318
method so just saying that when you use

1045
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,440
an hlc doesn't mean that the result is

1046
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,639
something that you can rely on and this

1047
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,519
is also when uh my colleague here Daniel

1048
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:53,039
mentioned that you can have hlc uh

1049
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:55,079
analysis in four different Laboratories

1050
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,440
and you get four different results me as

1051
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,000
a pharmacist I will get a heart attack

1052
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,318
because this is U we cannot just rely

1053
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,559
and say this is a hlc and it's good

1054
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,880
enough so I'm sure that this would be

1055
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:11,839
the biggest reason for the uh difference

1056
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,480
in the uh results I I personally would

1057
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:17,960
ask what kind of method was used whether

1058
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,719
this method is prepared to be um used

1059
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,199
for the analysis of different matrixes

1060
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,639
yeah but I I know the uh the research um

1061
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:28,759
Dr reik is referencing but it's um it

1062
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:31,199
has a publication to it actually but it

1063
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,599
just shows that within the non-medical

1064
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,239
part there is so much fluctuation in the

1065
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,000
product and that that's I think the

1066
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,679
point that uh is most important that

1067
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,800
there is a varying quality of product

1068
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,399
with a lot of tainting and lot of

1069
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,280
additional things you shouldn't be in

1070
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,838
there yeah have for one one more

1071
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,519
question one more question yeah one

1072
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:53,679
observation I would like to congratulate

00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:57,280
ladies on this panel because you are

1074
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:59,279

more question or I don't know but I

1078
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,598
