1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,120
hey it's great to be back to icbc again

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,280
this year uh

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,199
uh it's my second time attending this

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,278
conference uh i was really looking

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,160
forward to this this year last year was

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,079
so good um and i made so many contacts

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,560
and got the chance to learn a ton about

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,159
what's happening here in europe uh i was

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,198
really excited at the opportunity to

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,399
come back

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
and be part of

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,320
this program so uh i wanted to maybe

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
just

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,439
spend a little bit of time this is

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
always uncomfortable for me so bear with

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,159
me but just kind of talking a little bit

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
about my background

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,519
so you guys kind of give some context

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,039
for some of the other things that i'm

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,320
going to talk about

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,600
and

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,439
some of the experiences i've had here in

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
the cannabis industry so

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,119
getting into that

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,000
i started my career as a police officer

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,238
so i was a police officer in a city just

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
outside denver colorado

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,839
and while i was a police officer i was

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,439
going to grad school getting my mba an

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,440
international business

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,878
and i got recruited by the department of

32
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,679
revenue which is the agency that does

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,118
all the taxing et cetera but they also

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
have enforcement groups like law

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,640
enforcement agencies that oversee gaming

36
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,438
liquor

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,879
and in 2010 we started overseeing

38
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,719
cannabis regulation when we started

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,000
licensing on businesses

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,640
in colorado and that's when i

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,159
transitioned from the gaming division to

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,118
the marijuana enforcement division to

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,118
help

44
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,040
establish that agency and when i first

45
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,118
got involved in that on the medical side

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,320
my boss told me it's gonna be about 10

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,319
15 maybe 20 years before we legalized

48
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,559
cannabis for adult use but it was only

49
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,118
two short years later and we

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,920
had a constitutional amendment that

51
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,599
changed the law from just medical to

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
including adult use and we were

53
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,519
implementing that as well

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
so my job at that time was as the

55
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,920
director of the marijuana enforcement

56
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,079
division and i was responsible for

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,159
starting a new agency

58
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,158
leading the teams that created all the

59
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,079
regulations in colorado

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,200
and also i served as a subject matter

61
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,519
expert

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
with our legislature to help kind of

63
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,959
inform how that policy could evolve over

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,719
time so all in all i've got background

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,840
in law enforcement

66
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,598
background is a policy maker

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
i'm also a

68
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,799
business background now that i've been

69
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,159
working in the private sector with

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
metric for 2019 since 2019

71
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,959
where

72
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,840
we operate in 20 different states where

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,920
we help track all the cannabis for uh

74
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,759
regulators in those states

75
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,119
and then i also have an academic

76
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,479
background and the reason why that's

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,000
important is because

78
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,318
over time i've really developed a

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
passion for

80
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
arriving at balance public policy

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
because i really think it's possible

82
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,719
especially in the cannabis space where

83
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,560
everybody everybody industry

84
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,280
public health officials government we

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,878
can put public health and safety first

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
but also do that in a way where we

87
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,000
balance

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,519
the business interests of cannabis

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
companies operating in the framework

90
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,840
all right so i thought i'd start with

91
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,598
where i've had most of my experience

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,080
um as you look at this uh map of the u.s

93
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,919
you'll see that uh like 36 different

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
states have adopted some form of

95
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,359
legalization whether it's medical or

96
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,359
retail by the way if you see uh the dark

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,560
i'm sorry the bright green states are

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,879
the uh the recreational states um those

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,680
all have medical programs as well but 36

100
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,000
states that are operating in this in

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
with legalization

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,439
and

103
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,919
as i mentioned before we operate in 20

104
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,959
of these states uh tracking cannabis for

105
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,798
government

106
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,439
but what i think is most important i

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
really want to emphasize here is

108
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,680
ten years ago most of these states

109
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,318
didn't have any kind of program and this

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,560
these these changes don't occur unless

111
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,479
you have public policy to support it

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
right so public policy has to change

113
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,479
from and in our case in the us it's

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
changing from a policy was more focused

115
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,318
on criminal enforcement and

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,560
transitioning to a regulatory model that

117
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,518
was much more permissive

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,280
so

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,560
if i think about it that way and i think

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,640
there's i look back on everything that

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,478
i've witnessed over the last 10 years

122
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,798
operating in the space

123
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,000
i'd say there's like three forces that

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,078
are at play

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,399
that if you can kind of understand those

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,319
three you kind of start to anticipate

127
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,560
when you think public policy in this

128
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,319
particular area is going to change

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
and so there's three areas the first one

130
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,478
i want to talk about is uh the problem

131
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
like think of it as a stream

132
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,839
that's flowing they're all three

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,959
independent when all three streams come

134
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,638
together

135
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,399
you have a window of opportunity where

136
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
you'll see public policy change the

137
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,239
first stream is the problem stream

138
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,959
and in the problem stream

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,478
basically the the public sentiment is

140
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,758
changing such

141
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,519
that

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,120
you can it favors one or new outcomes or

143
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,799
evolution of public policy over the

144
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
others so think of this as public

145
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,680
opinion shifting

146
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,959
from one one to one one aspect of public

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
policy to the other so as i mentioned

148
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,680
earlier uh we were shifting from

149
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
criminal enforcement type of posture

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,840
more towards a permissive cannabis

151
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,839
policy and we knew that because public

152
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,000
polling was telling us that

153
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,079
the mood was changing the media was

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,160
talking about the need for change so the

155
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,399
problem was really kind of palatable i

156
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,639
think most of what i heard yesterday

157
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,120
um about europe is the same is that the

158
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,720
the moot's changing so that's the first

159
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
stream that's the the problem stream the

160
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
next one is the policy stream and the

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,918
policy should just think of it as

162
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,639
everybody who wants to get involved with

163
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,639
solving that problem so once the problem

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,478
gets to a point where most people kind

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,079
of agree that it's a problem that's time

166
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,399
for change the status quo needs to

167
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,198
change you start seeing lobbyists

168
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,839
entrepreneurs businesses all starting to

169
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
come up with ways to be able to solve

170
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,918
those problems

171
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,759
and so they start to collectively get

172
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,758
together to come up with ideas on how

173
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
that's going to best be served

174
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,439
and if that does really well then the

175
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,599
third stream is the political stream and

176
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,160
the political stream is such that

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,520
you start to see elected officials or

178
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,479
people that are in

179
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,318
uh

180
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,000
positions of trust that have the ability

181
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,879
to create public policy like regulators

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,478
etc they start to get actively involved

183
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,600
and coming up with

184
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,680
the actual outputs like bills and new

185
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,919
regulations and those kinds of things

186
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
so we saw this play out in the u.s time

187
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,198
and time again from one state to the

188
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,198
next state where the problem stream

189
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,360
the policy stream and the political

190
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,520
stream all started to converge and

191
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,038
create these policy windows and one

192
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,758
consistent thing that happened in all

193
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,680
the states was a interest in being able

194
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,439
to collect data

195
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,918
that can help inform a lot of those

196
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,918
decisions and one other consistent piece

197
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,839
of that was track and trace that's where

198
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,598
metric is really closely involved is

199
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,758
helping government track cannabis from

200
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,079
the time baby plant to the time it's a

201
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
final product at the point of sale so we

202
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,800
collect a lot of data and the reason why

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,439
data is so important is all three of

204
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,160
those streams the problem the policy and

205
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,639
political they all feed off of data they

206
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
look at they use the data to make their

207
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
points

208
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,800
for change in the future

209
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,639
so that's the u.s

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
we see all three

211
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,598
of these police all three of these

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
streams

213
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,478
actively involve or actively increasing

214
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,120
and converging here in europe and

215
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,120
thinking more specifically about germany

216
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,759
we all have seen

217
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,519
the the end result or like the all three

218
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
of these streams active over the last

219
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,680
couple of days so if you look at some of

220
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,919
this data certainly in europe it would

221
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,319
appear that public sentiment towards

222
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,918
legalization both on the medical side

223
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,199
and the adult use side

224
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,478
is increasing

225
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
so public

226
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,038
opinion around a particular policy issue

227
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,318
is really really important to that

228
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,478
problem stream

229
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
so it's getting a lot of attention and

230
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,478
on the policy side of things which is

231
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,479
almost everybody in this room in some

232
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,560
way shape or form is trying to find

233
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,878
solutions to

234
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,038
uh that problem like how do we

235
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
change from the status quo that we

236
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,800
currently sit in

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
and get to the next level of change

238
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
that's going to be meaningful that can

239
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,560
protect public health and safety but

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,038
also create a business model

241
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,079
um and then the second thing that i'd

242
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,240
like to say is that we also like so look

243
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,318
just back back a quick step i think

244
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,199
everybody in this room is in some way

245
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,959
shape or form actively involved

246
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,560
like whether you know it or not in the

247
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,718
policy side of things we all want to

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,718
find solutions i heard yesterday on

249
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,959
several of the panels and from some of

250
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,680
the keynotes that

251
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,598
we

252
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,919
are the ones that are most likely to

253
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,839
bring the best solutions to government

254
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,679
to be able to fix this and what i think

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,600
makes this more exciting than anything

256
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,439
is that yesterday we also had

257
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
politicians that were here we had point

258
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,440
e we had elected officials that were

259
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,039
basically telling us that they already

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,519
kind of concluded

261
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,559
that the current situation in germany

262
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,000
uh needs to be uh needs to evolve and

263
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,559
that we want to see

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,080
uh change and that that change is likely

265
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,119
to be in the form of either expanded

266
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
medical or adult use but which but even

267
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,879
though i think

268
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,639
we didn't get like that clear framework

269
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,080
like this is exactly what we're going to

270
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,240
do this is exactly what the bill is

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,399
going to look like it was very symbolic

272
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,839
to have people who are operating in the

273
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,639
political stream

274
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,560
come here yesterday and talk to us about

275
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,679
how they're committed to

276
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,639
some form of advancing of legalization

277
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,479
policy here in germany so we're excited

278
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,120
about what's happening here in europe

279
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
there is all three streams are are there

280
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
i think

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,639
uh you have public sentiment

282
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,640
is really geared towards

283
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,480
uh more towards legalization or at least

284
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,319
it's heading that direction there's a

285
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,120
lot of groups getting together like this

286
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,000
to come up with solutions uh and the

287
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
politicians are actively involved in in

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,919
change

289
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
so

290
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,838
now that we're if if we're kind of like

291
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,838
somewhat in agreement that that's the

292
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
situation we should start thinking a

293
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
little bit more about what government's

294
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
role should be in this

295
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,600
and uh i think

296
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,479
like one of the biggest challenges the

297
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,959
government faces uh in this is balancing

298
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,278
all the different interests that exist

299
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,319
so i kind of explained earlier the three

300
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:25,759
streams

301
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,040
the problem stream

302
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,240
and all the people that are engaged in

303
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,719
that

304
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,320
this policy stream

305
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
and all the groups and people that are

306
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,079
involved in that and all the politicians

307
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,479
that are involved in the political

308
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,958
streams i kind of explained all those as

309
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,720
being monolithic groups

310
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,679
uh that uh

311
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,160
um

312
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,958
all agree on the direction but that's

313
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,958
not the case there are all forms or

314
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,119
there's all different types of opinions

315
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,239
on how this policy should evolve over

316
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
time

317
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
and

318
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
government's role should be to try and

319
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,319
help

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,480
include all those different voices to

321
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,879
find out where the bridges are and being

322
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,959
able to form public policy uh that works

323
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,879
for everybody if i hadn't seen myself if

324
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,559
you're skeptic or just really tired

325
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,078
because it's so early in the morning

326
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,078
about it if i hadn't seen it for myself

327
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,838
i'd probably join skeptics in the room

328
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,919
on how challenging that is and while it

329
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,399
is challenging and it is hard i really

330
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,199
believe that you can hit but you can

331
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,120
reach public policy that balances public

332
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,079
health and safety and some of the main

333
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,200
concerns the government has but also be

334
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,199
able to

335
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,320
like allow for

336
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,839
a business or or an industry that can

337
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
not only survive in that but actually

338
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
thrive in that in that arena so the

339
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
government's role should be

340
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,518
trying to balance all those interests

341
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,639
and there's like four things that we've

342
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,000
seen i'll go through these pretty

343
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,319
quickly but

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,399
there's four things that that we've seen

345
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,959
uh that we see as success factors so

346
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,519
when government really considers these

347
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,319
four things deeply um and they're in the

348
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,278
process of developing public policy if

349
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
they

350
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,559
if they take these into consideration

351
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,399
there's a real strong likelihood of

352
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,879
having a strong regulated market so the

353
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
first one's implementation timeline the

354
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,639
next one is including diverse

355
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,079
stakeholders

356
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
in the process

357
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,599
talk a little bit about financial

358
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,879
expectations in particular like tax

359
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
structure

360
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,159
and what's important there and then also

361
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,359
the centralized data collection

362
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,958
so i'm going to go into these each a

363
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,959
little bit more detail so the

364
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,958
implementation timeline so

365
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,199
what often happens is

366
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,599
uh public officials who are responsible

367
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,600
for writing the first public policy

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,278
um they pass it

369
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,440
they go out on the steps of parliament

370
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,639
or the steps of the state house and

371
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,240
they're high-fiving each other with

372
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
their big accomplishment and that's

373
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
where the real work begins that's what

374
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,759
regulators are coming in to to implement

375
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,159
the policy businesses or trying to

376
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,240
make sure that they can keep up with the

377
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,600
short timelines what we've seen time and

378
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,519
time again

379
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,120
as government have been implementing

380
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,839
this policy is that they didn't give

381
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,839
themselves enough time or they didn't

382
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,200
consider all the different voices that

383
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,040
were important to determine whether or

384
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
not those timelines were realistic or

385
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,559
not so a couple of

386
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
a couple examples of this

387
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,919
often times

388
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
the testing facilities that are

389
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,360
responsible for

390
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,320
providing tests

391
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,159
there's not enough of them so so you

392
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,120
have this public policy in place that

393
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,319
says it's

394
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,159
got to be january 1st of 2023

395
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
and you have to do all this testing and

396
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,919
there's not enough testing facilities to

397
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,078
actually test the product

398
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,759
or similarly

399
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,239
there's this expectation that there's

400
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,240
going to be 200 cultivations that are

401
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,959
licensed by january 1st there's going to

402
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
be 500 stores and they don't take into

403
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,559
account the fact that local

404
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,720
jurisdictions so cities

405
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,799
where these flights and premises are

406
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
have all sorts of system

407
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,479
processes that they have to go through

408
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,759
to approve a business

409
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,278
that's not even canvas business

410
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,559
sometimes it can take six months to a

411
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,720
year to get that done and so if you're

412
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,278
not thinking about that oftentimes the

413
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,720
tax projections are off because

414
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,720
those businesses didn't open up as

415
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
quickly as they thought so on the

416
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,839
implementation timeline side of things

417
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,278
but i would just like make sure that

418
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,199
it's like important understand is that

419
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,480
you've got to give yourself enough time

420
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,879
and what's even more important is you

421
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,278
have to make sure that you include the

422
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,559
right stakeholder groups in the process

423
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,559
of determining determining what those

424
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,000
timelines are because if you don't

425
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,078
chances are good

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,198
that you're going to miss something and

427
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,958
you're not going to be able to implement

428
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,879
on time because it's just not literally

429
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,319
not possible for

430
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,720
the different

431
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
dependencies to be met in time

432
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
so

433
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
diverse viewpoints this is that area

434
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,079
that i was talking about earlier that

435
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,360
i'm so passionate about you cannot reach

436
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,958
balanced public policy in a vacuum so

437
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
government officials and a former

438
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,559
government official admit i couldn't do

439
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,320
this i couldn't just like listen to a

440
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,239
few people and then lock myself in a

441
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,079
room and write about a bunch of policy

442
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,879
and have it be effective right you have

443
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,159
to

444
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,639
include as many stakeholders as you can

445
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,360
to the table to be able to

446
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,600
better understand uh what their needs

447
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,839
are what their limitations are and the

448
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,399
types of things that they can or can't

449
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
do to get a policy implemented this is

450
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,519
very very important in legalization in

451
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,199
fact i would say that um

452
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,120
with the research that i did while i was

453
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,799
finishing up my dissertation a couple

454
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
things that i found

455
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,799
that helps make

456
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
public policy effective and that is if

457
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,958
stakeholders are involved in the process

458
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
feel like they've been heard during the

459
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,039
process chances are good

460
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,240
they're going to support that policy

461
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,000
going forward so as a government

462
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
official i wanted as many stakeholders

463
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
to support as possible but it gets even

464
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,758
better if they feel like they can

465
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,680
educate others on their position and

466
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,199
they can learn from other stakeholders

467
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,359
we saw this time and time again in

468
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,919
particular i saw law enforcement's

469
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,000
mindset change a lot during the

470
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,679
regulatory process when they were

471
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,278
hearing from industry on some of the

472
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,879
challenges there were

473
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,600
getting the right labeling requirements

474
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,000
on labels getting like how like how

475
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,159
quickly label brick labeling regulations

476
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,399
change might take six months for them to

477
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,919
actually be able to turn that around

478
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
and get the new labeling requirements

479
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,120
put on the product so it was really

480
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,480
interesting to see law enforcement in

481
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
particular say like wait a second i

482
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,039
hadn't even thought about all these

483
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560
challenges the business i just thought

484
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,719
businesses were always able to move

485
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,758
really quickly and so they learned a lot

486
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,720
so then so so it's being heard being

487
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,800
able to educate get educated but also

488
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
ultimately every stakeholder that's

489
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,319
involved in the process regardless of

490
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,758
which stream you're in you want to be

491
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
able to look at the public policy when

492
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,919
it's done and say

493
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,759
i can see where i influenced this public

494
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,278
policy i didn't get everything i wanted

495
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,879
but i got a bunch of what i wanted and

496
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,559
so i think i can live with this public

497
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,799
policy and i can support it going

498
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,479
forward so diverse viewpoints is really

499
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,359
really important

500
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,959
for

501
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,959
government to be successful

502
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,838
the next thing i wanted to talk about

503
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,919
was tax revenue uh and the financial

504
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
expectations around that

505
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,360
i don't know about you but i've heard a

506
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,038
lot of politicians when they think about

507
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
legalizing cannabis they kind of

508
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,038
gravitate towards the tax revenue that

509
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,038
will come in

510
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,519
and oftentimes the expectations they

511
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,439
have are high because they they think

512
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,679
that cannabis businesses are

513
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,038
wildly profitable and that they're

514
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,640
wildly successful and they're just

515
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,798
rolling in cash so we should be able to

516
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,799
tax i think we heard yesterday canada i

517
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,480
also know that california

518
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,639
and some of the other states the tax the

519
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,640
tax rates are really high and a lot of

520
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,960
those were set when

521
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,360
uh the wholesale price of cannabis was

522
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,798
fifteen hundred dollars and now when you

523
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,519
have more and more players entering the

524
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:42,079
market the cop or the price of wholesale

525
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,400
cannabis is going to go down and so tax

526
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,279
tax models based on those types of uh

527
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,600
wholesale prices can have impacts down

528
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,119
the road and so expectations around

529
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,918
taxes should be

530
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,239
that

531
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,080
you can certainly fund the things that

532
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,919
need to be focused you need to focus on

533
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,279
from taxing standpoint so the cost of

534
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,200
regulation

535
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,440
um

536
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,519
funding uh like different types of drug

537
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,519
treatment programs etc but you're not

538
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,960
gonna be able to fix all your billion

539
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,400
dollar problems you're not gonna be able

540
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,558
to fix

541
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,640
uh any like social injustices that

542
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,599
you're trying to or

543
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,160
fix like just with cannabis money

544
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,159
but you can't but it will fund itself so

545
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
cannabis legalization and the taxes that

546
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
you get from it

547
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,159
can do some really good work in that

548
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,320
case but it's not going to fix roads

549
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,440
it's not going to build new schools it's

550
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,558
not going to do a lot of those other

551
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,240
things

552
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,160
so setting some of those financial

553
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,079
expectations as a government official is

554
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,798
really important but it's also be really

555
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,759
mindful of how you structure that such

556
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,960
that industry can have competitive

557
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,679
pricing

558
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,200
to an illicit market you have to be able

559
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
to compete with the illicit market if

560
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,519
you if you if you don't then then it's

561
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,279
difficult and i think like people always

562
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,160
ask me like hey what keeps you awake at

563
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,319
night when you were government

564
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,640
officially trying to do this my one one

565
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,918
thing that oddly enough was i was really

566
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
concerned

567
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,720
that consumers wouldn't shift their

568
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,919
buying patterns from

569
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,600
an illicit market to a regulated market

570
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,120
i was afraid that the price was gonna be

571
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,519
so disparate

572
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,359
that that wasn't uh that that wasn't

573
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,119
gonna be something that they did right

574
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,359
and so we were hoping to try and set up

575
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,279
the the regulatory framework such that

576
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,159
there was some level of parity or at

577
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,319
least close between an illicit market

578
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,640
and a regulated market think about this

579
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,240
the canvas market is very artisan

580
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,640
right so they're very

581
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
tied closely with the the group or the

582
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,880
or the producer of their cannabis and so

583
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
it's not easy to get them to change even

584
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,039
if it's better quality product it's

585
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,160
tested there's good information on the

586
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,200
labels

587
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
so

588
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,519
so

589
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,678
being able to switch those buying

590
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:52,519
patterns the taxing structure can't be

591
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,519
such that they can't compete in price

592
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,440
the the last thing i want to talk about

593
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,679
of these four is the the database and i

594
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,038
know this gets like really into my

595
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,038
wheelhouse

596
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,240
and my role at metric and i've kind of

597
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,400
talked a little bit more about what

598
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,839
track and trace is but

599
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,200
it's very important as i mentioned

600
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:13,678
before to everybody in this ecosystem

601
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,159
around cannabis legalization it's very

602
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,440
important that we have data to inform

603
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,520
decisions about the policy whether it's

604
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,000
trying to

605
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,599
increase public opinion about the

606
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,759
potential for a credible regulated

607
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,480
market whether it's trying to find new

608
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,759
solutions to complex problems

609
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,079
that we face

610
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,640
in new regulated markets or whether it's

611
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,599
politicians using that data to help

612
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,679
evolve or evaluate the policy all those

613
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,199
things are important and there's a great

614
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,080
opportunity

615
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,558
at

616
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,038
right now in europe as governments are

617
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,918
contemplating new regulatory frameworks

618
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,079
to create a data collection methodology

619
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,080
that that helps to inform all the

620
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,119
stakeholders in the ecosystem

621
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,199
so

622
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,439
what we do as a company is we track

623
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
cannabis for government

624
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,120
from the time it's a little baby plant

625
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,558
until it's final product at the point of

626
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,479
sale and all that data uh is utilized to

627
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,038
inform a lot of those decisions that

628
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,120
that um i was talking about earlier but

629
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,679
the most important thing i want to

630
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,359
to say here's it is possible to

631
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,480
efficiently collect this data in

632
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,079
like during normal operational business

633
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,558
routines

634
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,639
and utilize that data to be able to

635
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,960
keep your regulators informed almost in

636
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,600
real time so that the work that they do

637
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,000
to do audits etc like that is not

638
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,839
creating like a hardship for the company

639
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,759
it's very very important that government

640
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,839
can be efficient so i'm talking about

641
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,440
roles for government very very important

642
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,519
that they can be efficient and how they

643
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
do that so here's kind of how we do it

644
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,359
so we have a database

645
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
um uh every

646
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,319
plant

647
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
every

648
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,480
movement of that plant through the

649
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,640
supply chain harvesting

650
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,720
all the testing results

651
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,559
all the transportation

652
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,880
and all the financial transactions that

653
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,200
happen at the wholesale tier

654
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,919
and at the point of sale are collected

655
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,080
in companies normal like every day

656
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,799
business systems that they use those

657
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,960
business systems typically uh integrate

658
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,200
with our system and they share data back

659
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,640
and forth so that government has

660
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,558
one database

661
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,480
with a with data in it that's

662
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,359
consistently collected all the way

663
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,839
through

664
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,759
the stream of commerce so in other words

665
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,158
regulators don't have to learn

666
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,480
20 or 30 point of sales systems or 15 to

667
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,360
20 different erp systems

668
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
or

669
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,279
various different data analytical

670
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,000
systems they have to know their system

671
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,000
and the licensees report while they're

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
doing their normal business activities

673
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,319
their systems report back and forth into

674
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,440
it symmetric

675
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,720
taking a little bit deeper dive on that

676
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
is uh

677
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,400
as plants are as marijuana is planted

678
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,919
um each tag once it gets to a certain

679
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,080
height or each plant once it gets to a

680
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,159
certain height gets attacked

681
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,240
that tag has information about the name

682
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,720
of the license

683
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,558
where it where the license is located

684
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,120
etc and so

685
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,759
as those plants work their way through

686
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,399
the process as they trim them

687
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,599
as they record waste

688
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,440
all those things all that information

689
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,199
like movement from a veg state to a

690
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,640
flowering state all those data points

691
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,080
are collected

692
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,759
until it's harvested and then is that

693
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,279
because that material is ready to move

694
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,640
either to a manufacturer decree

695
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:37,359
concentrates or it's ready to go to a

696
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,840
store with smokeable cannabis um the

697
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,399
transportation's uh information is

698
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:46,000
collected and stored in the system along

699
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,960
with all of the testing that occurs

700
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,278
and

701
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,880
we can also go so far as to collect any

702
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,880
public government wants all the

703
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,520
nutrients and pesticides and things that

704
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,240
were used in the system in fact we're

705
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,679
currently working on uh some additional

706
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,200
functionality in our system where

707
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,120
licensees if they want to report

708
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
sustainability measures they would be

709
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,798
able to do that in the system to how

710
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,080
much water how much energy those types

711
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,359
of things would be things they could use

712
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,199
to help not only inform their own

713
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,798
business decisions but also to keep

714
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,159
government informed on what's going on

715
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,158
bottom line is this

716
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,080
product gets tracked all the way through

717
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,799
government has real real-time access

718
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,839
into that and so they can monitor

719
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:26,158
activities for compliance in real time

720
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,558
uh as uh the data's being collected and

721
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,039
they can make it a lot easier for uh

722
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,798
compliance to be shown and demonstrated

723
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,119
without having to go in

724
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,960
and move uh plants around and scan

725
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,319
barcodes etc

726
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,000
so

727
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,000
um as i'm getting ready close up because

728
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,400
i did want to leave a few minutes for

729
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,480
questions if i if i can but i want to

730
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,240
just like the benefits of having a good

731
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,640
track and trace system and the benefits

732
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,440
of having collecting the right data

733
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,038
along the way is really crucial

734
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,120
especially at the point we're in for

735
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,200
demonstrating credibility of the

736
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,879
regulated system i think all of us are

737
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,278
really interested and are genuinely

738
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,360
concerned about public health and safety

739
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,679
and wanting to be able to show that the

740
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,839
that the the industry can show

741
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,519
demonstrate to other stakeholders in

742
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,359
this in the space

743
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,278
that we can form a credible regulated

744
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,119
framework that we care about public

745
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,720
health we care about safety use

746
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,199
consumption all those things are very

747
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,480
very important to us as an industry and

748
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,400
we have the ability to be able to

749
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
demonstrate that so it creates

750
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,840
transparency in the marketplace

751
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
when i think about transparency in the

752
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,038
marketplace i'm not talking about just

753
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
us as an industry making the case to

754
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,720
government it's us putting government in

755
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,400
this in a position where they can be

756
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,759
transparent with us too this is how

757
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,919
we're going to regulate these are the

758
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,200
requirements if you do this you can be

759
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,960
reasonably assured that you're in

760
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,880
compliance all those things are really

761
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,400
important and by doing that we're all

762
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,120
kind of like benefit from having a

763
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,880
really safe marketplace

764
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,038
where product

765
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,278
quality goes up

766
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,158
product safety goes up

767
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,000
and we can provide a much better product

768
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,278
that is at the right price where

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,359
consumers will change their buying

770
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,558
patterns and also too there's uh the

771
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,479
security

772
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,079
side of things where

773
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
we're talking about

774
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,399
um

775
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,000
uh being able to ensure that

776
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,240
illicit actors that are not wanting to

777
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,480
on-ramp into the regulated marketplace

778
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
are not able to participate as easily in

779
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,159
the regulated marketplace because the

780
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,519
regulated marketplace

781
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,240
is such that uh it shines a bright light

782
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,558
on illicit actors the plan by itself is

783
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,278
indistinguishable as a regulated plant

784
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,480
or a illicit plan so the regulated

785
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,400
marketplace

786
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,558
can really benefit from being able to

787
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,559
secure the regulated market or the

788
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,639
supply chain such that it makes it much

789
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,798
more difficult for illicit actors

790
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,038
to get in and to the to the industry or

791
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,158
infiltrate it and do greater credibility

792
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,400
and then the last thing is just the

793
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,799
reporting side

794
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,038
i come from a regulatory background i

795
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,639
know from a lot of the from a lot of the

796
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,679
interactions that i've had with licensed

797
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
businesses

798
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,720
that

799
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,440
demonstrating compliance and the cost of

800
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,240
regulation can be very very high and so

801
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,159
we've gone to great lengths as a company

802
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,880
a lot of the work that i did as a policy

803
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,360
maker was based on hitting that balance

804
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,400
to where businesses in the cannabis

805
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,599
industry

806
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,278
not only can survive but really thrive

807
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,719
if it's done well

808
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,519
and they can report and kind of like

809
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,319
reduce those costs of compliance

810
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,158
so

811
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,639
with that

812
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,679
i would also just say

813
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
even though

814
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,278
i kind of focused on track and trace and

815
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,480
some of the benefits of tracking trades

816
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,038
all four of these things that you're

817
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,960
looking right now are also benefits or

818
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,720
good outcomes for any regulatory

819
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,798
structure we care about transparency we

820
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,038
care about safety uh we care about

821
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,918
creating efficiencies for businesses and

822
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,079
in in in building a secure a secure

823
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,600
supply chain so that i'd love to like

824
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,678
take a few questions if we have a few

825
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,759
minutes lewis koski everybody let's hear

826
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,759
it

827
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,319
uh i have a question why are we treating

828
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,440
weed like it's yellow cake uranium okay

829
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,439
uh we have time for one question up here

830
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,159
and then we have to move on

831
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,159
that was very good

832
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,000
uh lewis thanks for the presentation uh

833
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,038
brian roth with elevated signals i'm

834
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,480
curious if you could comment on

835
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,759
the alignment of a best interest

836
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,839
in the states

837
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,679
obviously you guys are contracted uh in

838
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,038
the u.s you guys are contracted by

839
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,080
states or the government is your

840
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,240
customer

841
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,918
um how could how can

842
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,720
the alignment of

843
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,960
business interests in terms of data and

844
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
what the government wants to track be

845
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,600
kind of better aligned in terms of

846
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,000
regulation um you know how can that

847
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,678
happen in europe

848
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,798
so from understanding your question

849
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,880
right i think i think what um

850
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,038
we've seen in the u.s and i think is

851
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,159
possible here in in

852
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,919
europe

853
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,679
um is

854
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,320
for government to be really in tune with

855
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,919
what the business interests are so i

856
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,200
think everybody recognizes the fact

857
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,520
we've heard this time and time again the

858
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,038
last couple days we we're here

859
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,440
we have an interest in making money we

860
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,038
want to create profitable businesses i

861
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,640
think if government can get past the

862
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,319
fact that businesses are looking for

863
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,440
that they have other needs that they're

864
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,200
trying to meet too there's a lot of

865
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,880
companies in the cannabis industry there

866
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,038
are mission-driven companies that care

867
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
about patients they care about providing

868
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,519
quality product

869
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,038
and they want to do a lot they have a

870
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,359
lot of the same

871
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,879
objectives that government has

872
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,398
is trying to make sure that they're

873
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,640
aligned with

874
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,639
the burdens of being a part of a

875
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,880
regulated community that's why we think

876
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,080
it's so important for government to make

877
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,679
sure that they're engaged with

878
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,278
stakeholders

879
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,278
to better understand those needs not

880
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,558
just hear a couple of comments here and

881
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,759
there but actually

882
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,200
like meaningful engagement with them uh

883
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,200
to better understand what their needs

884
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,360
are and then also to having efficient

885
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,880
systems in place if you've been like i'm

886
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,558
sure most people here have been to

887
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,399
cultivations i've been to hundreds of

888
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:13,278
cultivations in my career

889
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:16,398
and there's just no way to

890
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,398
audit uh plants that are in uh like a

891
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,000
veg state to a flowering state without

892
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,599
moving them all around you know so we

893
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,200
try to create a system where

894
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,439
government's able to be able to do that

895
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,600
much more efficiently without creating

896
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,200
business disruptions and so i think when

897
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,798
we're trying to balance those needs you

898
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,960
have to be able to

899
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,839
balance like what's the right level of

900
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,919
public health and safety

901
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:40,000
versus what's uh what's the business

902
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,880
needs and then create systems and

903
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,398
processes like that so it's efficient

904
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,260
thank you very much one more time lewis

905
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:53,439
