00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:02,129
obviously we're gonna be talking about a

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,750
lot of Canadian specific details but our

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,759
goal is to kind of give you an overview

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,978
of what it looks like when an

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,200
industrialized nation legalizes cannabis

22
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,450
some of the different things that happen

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,728
we've got an amazingly diverse panel

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,500
here right now that represents a wide

25
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,219
variety of stakeholders within the

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,489
industry first we have Clinton young

27

00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,030
we've got licenses in two different

30
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,429
municipalities right now Clint works

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,320
closely with the lost organization it's

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,200
a mental health division that reflects

33
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,289
Clint's main focus with cannabis it's

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,530
called the living outside suffering

35
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,729
trauma and it provides services to

36
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,560
homeless or the under homes that needs

37
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,359
some support because they're also

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,409
suffering from mental illnesses so

39
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,409

only cannabis industry specific media

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,810

47
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,849
mission to empower informed cannabis

48

50
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:29,590

58
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:51,760

investment brokerage industry most

senior investment advisor with northern

66
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,349
securities just before we kind of get

67
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:15,099
into this I'm gonna give a very brief

68
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,840
and very condensed version of how Canada

69
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:20,739
actually sort of got to where we are

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,539
right now in 1969 the then Liberal

71
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,000
government decided that it wanted to do

72
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:26,919
a study on illegal drugs and on cannabis

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,719
it was called the lydian Commission took

74
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,579
them three years when they came back

75
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,370
they actually recommended that cannabis

76
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,110
be legalized nothing was actually done

77
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,360
about that at all for quite a few years

78
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,459
before there was any more kind of

79
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,560
government movement on this there were

80
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,689
battles in the courts lots of battles in

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,729
the courts and so courts had decided

82
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:50,739
that patients had right to access that

83
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,750
they had right to have someone else grow

84
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,400
for them that that person could grow for

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,159
more than one person then more than two

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,409
persons it was actually just a constant

87
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,389
fight for about 20 years while that was

88
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:04,240
going on dispensaries sort of exploded

89
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,729
as a gray market option some of them are

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,200
actually now

91
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:13,128
licensed in Vancouver in 2014-2015 when

92
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:16,488
the ACN part ACM PR was launched at that

93
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:18,459
point we had the first sort of fully

94
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,599
functioning legal medical system

95
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,550
unfortunately it still didn't work for

96
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,990
everybody in the country particularly

97
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,180
those that were already being serviced

98
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,590
by dispensaries that had a wider variety

99
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,959
of product that they were allowed to

100
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:32,119
carry we're allowed to talk about the

101
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:37,099
product more than the licensed producers

102
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,870
were and then in 2015 we got court cases

103
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,850
again decided we're gonna have edibles

104
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,949
at some point and other forms of

105
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,600
cannabis we do have an oil that was

106
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,710
introduced legally following that court

107
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,419
decision but that's all we've actually

108
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:53,418
seen on that at this point and we've put

109
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:55,639
medical on hold we you know in 2015 we

110
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,038
elected the first political party to

111
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,650
really run on a platform of full

112
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:01,849
legalization they won and we've been

113
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,679
sort of waiting to see what's gonna

114
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,479
happen with that first they've been very

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,160
clear we're not talking about medical

116
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:08,719
we're not gonna adjust it or do anything

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,700
it's just gonna stay in place we'll look

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,770
at it later after we've got some data

119
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,319
back from legalization we know we're

120
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:17,000
gonna have edibles but they're not even

121
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,129
gonna start talking about that for

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,680
another year so we know that that's

123
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:24,189
coming eventually the government's been

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,389
making some huge strides in terms of

125
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,759
easing some of the burdens on the large

126
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:30,590
licenses creating classes for smaller

127
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,800
licenses including micro producer

128
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:36,288
microprocessor and some nursery licenses

129
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,879
so we're seeing a lot of movement but we

130
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:40,159
haven't seen any sort of applications

131
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,839
yet for that and and provinces are

132
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,490
starting to roll out their retail models

133
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,138
we're in the East they're mostly going

134
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,000
to be controlled by government stores

135
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,370
and in the West they're mostly gonna be

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,038
private retail mostly still have to buy

137
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,079
from the government in between so with

138
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:56,810
that sort of as a context of where we

139
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,180
are overall in Canada Clint where are

140
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,538
you nm MJ exactly at within all of that

141
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,329
it's it's a little bit complex for us

142
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:08,598
because we are a Canada wide based

143
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:11,439
dispensary which meaning each province

144
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:15,399
has its own regulations and

145
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:19,029
as Jamie said Ontario where we're very

146
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,469
strong based out of we're having issues

147
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,379
with the government they want to have

148
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,590
full control over all distribution and

149
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:29,310
all levels of cannabis I'm working hard

150
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:32,079
right now with municipalities and

151
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,180
lobbying provincial government because

152
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,819
of the election coming up to have us

153
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,620
carp in either a medicinal and or

154
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:41,769
recreational component I'm not quite

155
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:46,449
sure yet how will look for MMJ Canada on

156
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:50,349
the west coast we have two licenses and

157
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:53,620
one in a variance with the city so for

158
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,510
us it's it's we have to be very patient

159
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,829
I said this last year when I was here we

160
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,709
had to be very patient and a year later

161
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:02,019
I still have to be very patient so it's

162
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:04,539
getting closer to legalization it's

163
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:07,029
getting closer to us figuring out which

164
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,350
path we're going to be going we are

165
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,819
trying to vertically integrate our

166
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,070
company on many other levels but as of

167
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,079
right now we have to let the the

168
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,110
government kind of unroll platforms and

169
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,789
we need to kind of make our next move a

170
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:32,139
very strategic one because it could make

171
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:33,669
or break us so so you guys just

172
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,529
announced that you're going public which

173
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:37,389
is kind of big news because that hasn't

174
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:40,689
been on the horizon for most people

175
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:44,168
that's right what has been going on for

176
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:46,719
you guys within all of this and yeah so

177
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:48,339
we play a role in bridging the

178
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,710
informational gap between buyer and

179
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,049
seller so essentially we're Canada's

180
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:55,049
largest cannabis media and tech company

181
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,280
whether that's through our events our

182
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,470
educational contents or our data

183
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,149
solutions and training services so

184
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,640
essentially the need that we've

185
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,349
identified in the role we play is as I

186
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,329
mentioned closing the informational gap

187
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,730
or the informational asymmetry between

188
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,319
buyer and seller and so where there's

189
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,480
min extremely tight advertising

190
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,659
restrictions and promotional tactics

191
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,850
that have been prohibited by the

192
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,919
government in the past we try to do the

193
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,379
best to inform and empower patients to

194
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,180
make informed cannabis decisions that

195
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,589
was true in today's market in

196
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,370
the medical world it'll be even more

197
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:32,110
true in the adult use world and so our

198
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,129
role becomes important because we know

199
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,418
that there's a lot of consumers will

200
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,149
come online for the first time or

201
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:39,120
consumers who have been buying the

202
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,320
category for a number of years but just

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,740
unfamiliar with what a legal market

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,000
looks like and so the idea is to

205
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,379
cultivate and disseminate the

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,740
information to help people make those

207
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:52,028
decisions nice thank you and Rob you

208
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,220
know you and I are kind of all over the

209
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:56,588
place with this stuff we've got our

210
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,259
fingers in a bunch of different pies but

211
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,880
overall how's that loosen it where's it

212
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:04,569
positioned within this whole frame ech

213
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:07,149
well I'm in a very unique position

214
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,480
because I grew up in the black market

215
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,919
but I also have a law degree from Oxford

216
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,870
University and I used to work in capital

217
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,909
markets in the city of London and on

218
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,159
Wall Street actually one of the firms I

219
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:20,350
used to work at was the cia's law firm

220
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,569
Sullivan &amp; Cromwell on Wall Street so

221
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,450
when I was done with that work and went

222
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,580
back to Vancouver my hometown I set up

223
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,920
shop with my own law practice well

224
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,950
because again I was known in the

225
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,889
industry and had training education and

226
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,528
experience that is certainly a value to

227
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:41,889
any emerging industry let alone the

228
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:45,220
cannabis space I've been very busy

229
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:49,028
and so with that we've seen a tremendous

230
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:52,300
amount of change from a few people with

231
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:56,110
pot to now everybody involved with pot

232
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:58,929
or cannabis and the proud the pride for

233
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:02,080
me is that legalization in Canada has

234
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:04,479
been driven by a court process it's

235
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,028
actually the people who've taken the

236
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,740
federal government to court and we have

237
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:11,078
in Canada what's called the Charter of

238
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,379
Rights and Freedoms and under the

239
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,778
Charter we have section 7 which is life

240
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:19,439
liberty and security of the person and

241
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:21,028
so it's basically through that

242
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,880
[Music]

243
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:27,429
fundamental right that the cannabis

244
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,429
program in Canada legally is started

245
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:33,709
going back as far as 2002

246
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:35,959
rushing fast-forward to today what we're

247
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,940
seeing and again why it's exciting and

248
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,060
frustrating for me at the same time as

249
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,580
we're seeing lots of interesting

250
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:48,079
endeavors and enterprise and cannabis

251
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:50,690
however those who have been the pioneers

252
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,420
of the market those who have been the

253
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:57,260
ones who've gone to jail for the right

254
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:59,629
to grow cannabis or to produce medicine

255
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:02,710
are not necessarily allowed to

256
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:05,509
participate in this new market in fact

257
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:07,610
Justin Trudeau our prime minister love

258
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:12,230
him or hate him I have mixed feelings

259
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:14,539
about him personally but he is agenda

260
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,139
with legalization is threefold

261
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:22,219
right one is to make our streets a

262
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,879
community safer okay that's an a good

263
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,810
idea

264
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:29,838
remove the black market and keep and

265
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:33,079
make it safe for children all of those

266
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,630
are noble endeavors but the execution of

267
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,910
them when you actually get behind and

268
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:40,970
look at how cannabis is being legally

269
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:43,730
regulated in Canada it's rather suspect

270
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,300
that those goals and endeavors will

271
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,060
happen

272
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:50,269
so really to sum up here I'm seeing a

273
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:52,969
lot if this marijuana industry was like

274
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,909
a roulette game I see red and black

275
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,580
legal illegal the difficulty however is

276
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:00,889
until we know what the actual rules and

277
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,350
the regulations look like anyone out

278
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:04,939
there who's an entrepreneur is not going

279
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,610
to know we're there to put their chips

280
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,550
on red or black or what number and then

281
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,159
to leverage to get an investment so I'm

282
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:15,740
confident and I'm also excited that as

283
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:18,679
we do see the rules and regulations in

284
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,589
Canada begin to normalize and level out

285
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,179
we're going to see even greater

286
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,940
entrepreneurship but at the same time I

287
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:28,909
also want to see greater inclusion from

288
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,750
the original og pioneers if you will who

289
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:34,969
got us this far and so with that and

290
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,169
either an I in and either way you look

291
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:41,959
at it Canada's a very exciting market so

292
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:42,939
glad that we're here yeah and you bring

293
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,319
up a very important

294
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,880
I mean one of the weird things to me

295
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,770
about this whole legalization thing is

296
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,570
that there's the it's you they're using

297
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,879
the same tools that they used in

298
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,340
prohibition so there's still some

299
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,139
lessons I think to be learned we'll

300
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,420
where where do you and your company all

301
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,090
fit within this this what's been going

302
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:03,459
on in Canada yeah yeah well first of all

303
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,350
I'm thankful that Rob is the chairman of

304
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,530
our advisory boards I just let him do

305
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,750
all the talking so but you know with

306
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,419
that said I can speak from the

307
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:16,779
perspective of a publicly listed company

308
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:21,490
in Canada we went through the transition

309
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:24,159
a couple of years ago like many cannabis

310
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:28,060
startups we went from the mining

311
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,409
industry which was depressed to going

312
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:32,519
through the whole change of business

313
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:36,579
scenario and becoming a listed public

314
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:39,699
company in the cannabis sector and and

315
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:45,190
through that process you know we've been

316
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:48,670
able to acquire to late stage applicants

317
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,700
under the ACM PR program which which is

318
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:54,819
the path one needs to take to to have a

319
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,009
license to to grant you the opportunity

320
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:01,960
to cultivate and sale sell product and

321
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:05,080
the medicinal space right now but you

322
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,940
know the opportunity I see for Canadian

323
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,460
publicly traded companies is we're

324
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,400
really at the tip of the spear when it

325
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:16,570
comes to raising capital and deploying

326
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,610
that capital internationally so specific

327
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,910
to Liberty leaf you know we're listed in

328
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,649
Canada on the CSC we're listed in the

329
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:25,449
oTCQB in the States and we're listed

330
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:29,139
here in Frankfurt or and in Frankfurt in

331
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:31,240
Germany and so the reason I wanted to

332
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:34,779
come to this conference was to learn

333
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:39,310
more about the aptitude for the the

334
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:41,259
German cannabis investor and you know

335
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:44,789
from what I can see today there's a lot

336
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:49,838
of interest in cannabis in investing and

337
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:52,539
so the the the where we fit in the mix

338
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,150
here is you know we're able to raise

339
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,689
capital deploy capital internationally i

340
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:00,769
I do feel that

341
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:03,790
the Canadian sector per se is getting a

342
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:07,250
little saturated when it comes to

343
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:09,110
licenses and and and what-have-you so

344
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,490
the opportunity we have again having the

345
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,159
platform of being able to raise

346
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,980
capitalists to deploy that whether it's

347
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,809
in Germany or Greece or Malta or you

348
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,389
name it whatever the countries are are

349
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:23,739
bringing medicinal legislation to the

350
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,310
table we want to be we want to be there

351
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,990
thank you

352
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:28,489
I also just want to apologize I

353
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,810
shouldn't a sat next to Clint it's like

354
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,860
if we went to high school together we'd

355
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:34,878
have been the kids in the back of the

356
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,860
class just take that every day one of

357
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,870
the big things for me that was the

358
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,360
biggest surprise in the legalization

359
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,009
process was the inclusion of the

360
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,639
different classes of licenses that kind

361
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:49,159
of came out of nowhere that was a big

362
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,159
step as you know an advocate lobbyists

363
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,539
that took about five years off my career

364
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,879
so I was kind of surprised to see that

365
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:58,509
happen so quickly what were some of the

366
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:02,449
biggest surprises for you

367
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:04,100
well the the biggest surprise was the

368
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:06,620
fact that everybody surprised that the

369
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,689
government is late leaving it up to the

370
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,879
province is the fact that everyone in my

371
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:12,379
industry seems to be shocked that the

372
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,419
government is going about it the way it

373
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:17,448
is when in reality no one should be

374
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:19,399
shocked they've always wanted to have a

375
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:21,049
strong control which is understandable

376
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,139
they've they've always kind of done

377
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:26,508
things the way they want and I think in

378
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,860
my industry you need to be prepared for

379
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,970
anything that the government is going to

380
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,800
do if you're if you're only

381
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,839
one-dimensional you're gonna be in a lot

382
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,019
of trouble I think you need to be able

383
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,639
to have your fingers in all pots in all

384
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,459
aspects of the industry so you can

385
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,250
prepare for the worst and or the best

386
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,778
pending on how it goes you know the

387
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,828
government has made it clear that

388
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:47,419
they're gonna leave it up to each

389
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:51,138
province

390
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:54,828
you know it's in no surprise to me you

391
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:56,959
know that it's it's each profit is going

392
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:58,789
about it drastically differently I I

393
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,429
guess I was surprised a little bit that

394
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:03,679
there wasn't any inclusion of a

395
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:05,480
dispensary model in Ontario at all like

396
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,678
really no no even talk about it no if

397
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,628
ands or buts

398
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,360
but it seems like now at the new

399
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:13,998
election there might be some hope for

400
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:20,298
that so we'll again have to be patient

401
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:22,759
wait and see so for myself I think what

402
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:23,959
I was not surprised about but perhaps I

403
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,149
would like to see the government show

404
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,759
more movement on is the treatment of

405
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:30,918
medical cannabis is distinct from adult

406
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:32,868
use cannabis and the regulations right

407
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,360
now very focused on the recreational

408
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:37,339
market I mean it has been a sprint since

409
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,308
the government announced the bill on

410
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:42,079
April 13th of last year but with every

411
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:43,638
iteration of regulations that are

412
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,858
released we continue to see that there

413
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:48,258
actually isn't a robust enough

414
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:50,569
distinction between the medical market

415
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:52,548
and the non-medical market so by way of

416
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,138
example medical cannabis in Canada is

417
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:56,778
still taxed unlike any other

418
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:58,969
prescription medication they're also

419
00:17:56,778 --> 00:18:01,190
proposing an excise tax on certain

420
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,159
medical products once the bill comes

421
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,389
into play in the fall and the packaging

422
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,169
regulations that were released a couple

423
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:11,648
months ago it dictates that packaging

424
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:13,369
for medical cannabis must be the same as

425
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:15,079
non-medical what it actually looks like

426
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:16,759
is completely plain packaging with a

427
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,210
list of health warnings and a massive

428
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,259
red stop sign that says warning THC so

429
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,179
if you're a patient that you're looking

430
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:26,419
to medicate and this is a medicine that

431
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:29,899
actually unlocks for you a day's worth

432
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:33,139
of functioning fully wear previous forms

433
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:35,148
of treatment were not effective for you

434
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:38,178
and you receive your medicine like that

435
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:39,469
it's not not the type of patients not

436
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,570
the type of health care we like to

437
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,389
deliver in Canada and yet that is the

438
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:45,950
reality we're facing now and so I'd like

439
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:47,918
to see more of a distinction between the

440
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,659
medical and the adult news markets and

441
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,129
though there is a lot of noise around

442
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,690
the recreational side of things and

443
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:55,730
rightly so it is a massive market and a

444
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,528
massive opportunity we mustn't forget

445
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,960
the patients who got us to where we are

446
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:02,388
today those who fought in the courts who

447
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,519
have advocated for decades and ensure

448
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:07,308
that their access to their medicine is

449
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,048
not limited and were potentially have

450
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:10,569
that in jeopardy if we don't take the

451
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:12,679
right steps now

452
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,999
yeah and that's been one of the the

453
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,350
concerning things about the liberal

454
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:18,200
platform you know they first came out

455
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:18,879
with it in 2013 way before they were in

456
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,250
power and

457
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,020
and they just never looked at medical

458
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,690
that was never anything medical it's a

459
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:27,250
little frustrating yeah I was just going

460
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,980
to say I mean I think that we recognize

461
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,390
there's only a small percentage of

462
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,620
people who actually go through the legal

463
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,520
medical channels so right now 19% of

464
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,129
consumers who report that they use

465
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,980
cannabis primarily for medical purposes

466
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,140
go through the legal channels that is a

467
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,269
you know a comment on access it's a

468
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,950
comment on price it's a comment at a lot

469
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,319
of things actually we need to do more

470
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,330
convenience we need to do more to ensure

471
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,250
that patients are treated as patients

472
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:56,619
distinct from a recreational consumer

473
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,450
well and the really interesting thing is

474
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,250
a large part of that percentage that you

475
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,289
just mentioned are new patients that a

476
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,240
CMP are actually opened up access to

477
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,369
people in rural areas that didn't have

478
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,990
access before so it was basically a new

479
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:11,319
market that kind of came in and opened

480
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,650
up Rob Lowe's live big surprise for you

481
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:18,750
about liberal legalization well yes

482
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:22,150
actually I have Jamie Shaw to thank for

483
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,190
the biggest surprise that Clint rightly

484
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,100
hit on that when it comes to government

485
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,890
money and control there aren't surprises

486
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:32,679
that's there to emmos but the biggest

487
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:35,200
surprise that Jamie informed me about

488
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,950
was when we started looking at the new

489
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,519
ACM PR or no excuse me the Bill c-45

490
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,470
cannabis Act now I know the Germans like

491
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,599
a good scary story

492
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,610
the Brothers Grimm right here's

493
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:51,699
something pretty grim so when you read

494
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:55,469
the definition of cannabis and then you

495
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:58,360
go to the cross reference schedule 1 and

496
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:01,690
schedule 1 the definition this is the

497
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:04,299
scary part says that the definition of

498
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:08,320
cannabis includes all phyto cannabinoids

499
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:11,349
derived from cannabis and non cannabis

500
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,720
derived sources we're similar to or

501
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:16,480
similar to so basically let me boil that

502
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,039
down why I find that so scary and

503
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,610
unforgivable is it's not the

504
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:24,639
government's job to say if you don't get

505
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:26,949
your phyto cannabinoids from us you're

506
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,440
going to jail that's a slippery slope

507
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,090
from if you don't get your water from us

508
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,070
you're going to jail

509
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,779
you don't get your food from us or if

510
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:37,869
your food is not prepared in the way

511
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:40,750
that we say so you're going to jail so

512
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:43,949
ultimately the scariest thing about Bill

513
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,410
c-45 is the degree of control by which

514
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,160
if you're doing anything outside the

515
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,080
circle

516
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,540
we'll call it the sacred circle of

517
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:55,480
legality if you do anything outside that

518
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:57,519
or produce phyto cannabinoids the same

519
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,710
phyto cannabinoids that you can get from

520
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,960
kale and echinacea you technically can

521
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:05,860
get from cannabis so I mean is anyone

522
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,410
else not alarmed about that it's it's

523
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:11,919
again and if these laws are not

524
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:14,650
challenged the scary thing is this gives

525
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,350
government and unfettered control over

526
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,990
essential aspects of human life and I

527
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:22,599
see cannabis being one more step to

528
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,390
where governments will be able to try to

529
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,609
control plant life organic material

530
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,910
which again next thing you know we'll be

531
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:33,099
cloning so that's the scary thing is

532
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,440
that people see this as just oh it's

533
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:38,859
cannabis it's a medicine it's a weed

534
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,740
toxic move on ultimately I think is a

535
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:43,869
fundamental human freedom around access

536
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,049
to a substance that we all need for

537
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:50,229
survival but for the last 93 years have

538
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,680
been denied by the government so yes I

539
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,779
find not quite surprising and scary

540
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,039
think strap well what's kind of been the

541
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:59,230
biggest surprise for you in this process

542
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,149
well you know not so much surprising

543
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,400
it's I think from our perspective as a

544
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:07,390
pub Co we just have to adapt and be

545
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:12,160
nimble in in our sort of approach to

546
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:14,500
cannabis so a good example would be the

547
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,600
the recent advent of the micro

548
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:22,119
cultivator status and the it just sort

549
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,730
of dovetailed quite nicely with our

550
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:28,869
distribution sales only license that

551
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,730
we're on we've we've got a late-stage

552
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:34,299
application through the Health Canada

553
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,120
CMP our process but what that means is

554
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:40,210
the micro cultivators are the the

555
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,069
smaller MMAR growers that the the

556
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,039
government wants to basically roll into

557
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:47,119
the

558
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:50,240
the program here and so the advent of

559
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,689
that level of Licensing will allow those

560
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,289
individuals to continue to grow that

561
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,910
they cannot sell direct to the public so

562
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:02,899
specific to Liberty leaf with our

563
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:05,150
distribution only license those micro

564
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,269
cultivators will be we'd be a

565
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,380
partnership with those growers and so

566
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:11,690
again and then we would take that

567
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:14,180
product and take to the to directly to

568
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,890
the market to the retail consumer so not

569
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,230
so much surprising on our end it's just

570
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,930
all about adapting with you know the

571
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:24,950
ever-changing rules and goalposts that

572
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:27,019
that come our way please I think another

573
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,720
good surprise as well as the licenses

574
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:31,430
was the changes to hemp regulations that

575
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,519
was another kind of unexpected thing

576
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,830
that came in our old hemp regulations

577
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,240
were ridiculous you could basically grow

578
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:39,439
the hemp and then had to destroy the

579
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,809
rest of the plant you weren't allowed to

580
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,370
extract any CBD or use the roots or do

581
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,869
anything else with it and that's that's

582
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:47,899
eased up a lot so I think that was

583
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:50,539
another kind of nice surprise other than

584
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,330
you know the space that we're in is is

585
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:56,029
very rapidly evolving and changing all

586
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,470
the time other than some of those what

587
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:00,279
would have been sort of the specific

588
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,740
issues or challenges that that you have

589
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:08,779
with your company and how its positioned

590
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:10,730
and how regulations are coming one of

591
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:12,829
the major challenges we've had with MMJ

592
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,349
canada is that each province is

593
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:18,109
drastically different per regulations so

594
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:20,599
you get comfortable with a way you're

595
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:22,909
doing something in the industry for

596
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,529
example in Vancouver and then they

597
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,960
announced a regulation in Alberta and

598
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:28,309
you're filing and doing an application

599
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,519
that's something completely out of your

600
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:34,429
realm and not what you're used to doing

601
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,500
the the fear of the unknown of where I'm

602
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:39,590
gonna get my supply in the future how

603
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,869
many licenses I'm gonna have is is not

604
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:44,019
concerning but you know it's definitely

605
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:47,329
something I think about on a daily basis

606
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:48,369
so where I see myself and in the space

607
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:51,549
is that

608
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:53,919
got to be very vigilant on on how we

609
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:56,200
approach each province I think we need

610
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,529
to do a lot of education on each

611
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,000
province Jamie also works for MMJ Canada

612
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:04,058
as a government relations director so

613
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,579
having her on my team has really eased

614
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:08,920
up a lot of the things and the processes

615
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:11,230
for each province because she is an

616
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,570
educator and she investigates into each

617
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,420
province on how they operate so that's

618
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:19,509
made my life a lot easier but moving

619
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:22,269
forward I think it's going to be key on

620
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:24,819
who you partner with key on your

621
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:27,579
standard key on your product testing and

622
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:29,019
I think if you cross all your T's and

623
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:31,599
dot your i's you have a good chance of

624
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:37,720
longevity in the cannabis space as long

625
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:39,490
as you're willing to adapt one of the

626
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,600
things that you're doing but would have

627
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,440
been some of the challenges that you're

628
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:46,709
seeing coming I think where we position

629
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,700
ourselves at the centre of Education and

630
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,480
introducing and welcoming new people

631
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:55,210
into the into the market whether that is

632
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,640
regulated consumers or non consumers or

633
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,319
business people it's just ensuring that

634
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,300
we're deconstructing that stigma that's

635
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,450
still it still remains a problem

636
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:06,339
probably not in a room like this but the

637
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,679
reality is that a lot of people still

638
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:10,569
continue to harbor demonization of the

639
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,519
plants and so where we have to work

640
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:14,859
extra hard is to deconstruct that poner

641
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,179
potheads donor archetype that really

642
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:19,329
doesn't resemble anything but the

643
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:23,500
unwanted poster child and so for us

644
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:24,759
where we have you know 250 odd thousand

645
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,679
medical patients through the legal

646
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,019
channels now and we'll have five to

647
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,630
maybe up to 8 million consumers come

648
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:33,460
online as a result of legalization a lot

649
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,470
of these people have no idea how

650
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,880
cannabis interacts with the body they

651
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,400
have no idea what the different

652
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,860
molecular compounds are the difference

653
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,750
between you know THC and CBD and and all

654
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:45,339
the other ones I mean it's it's a fun

655
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,950
opportunity to be able to educate them

656
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:49,599
when you can speak about some of the the

657
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,179
details that people may not be familiar

658
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,369
with for example I love talking about

659
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,490
the myth that cannabis necessarily

660
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:59,229
induces the munchies if you talk about

661
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,380
cannabinoid like THC V tetra hydro kind

662
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,420
of bitter in it's a very effective

663
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,340
appetite suppressant and so can be used

664
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,690
in weight-loss routines these are the

665
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,069
kinds of conversations that had people

666
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,140
take a step back where they thought they

667
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:13,109
already knew something and you're really

668
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:17,490
helping them you know swim across that

669
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:18,539
lake of misinformation and so to your

670
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,819
question the biggest challenge we have

671
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:23,759
is is education because people are

672
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:24,809
coming from a place of at best ignorant

673
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,210
at worst

674
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,619
opposition because of the results of

675
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,950
ninety five years of prohibition

676
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:33,269
yeah absolutely and the previous speaker

677
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,220
also referred to one of the things

678
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:37,980
around this is that we don't actually

679
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,809
know that much about cannabis for as

680
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,460
long as we've been using it within our

681
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:43,529
new scientific system we don't really

682
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,180
know and most of the research that we're

683
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,649
doing isn't really telling us anything

684
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,690
because we don't know what cannabinoid

685
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,150
profile was tested how many what the

686
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,490
terpene levels were it would be a very

687
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,110
simple fix to just you know if you're

688
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,329
gonna do research maybe find out what it

689
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:59,669
is first but yeah and that's I think

690
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:01,980
responsibility the the industry needs to

691
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,509
take on where the result of almost a

692
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,039
decade of prohibition in Canada at least

693
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,990
results in you know two different

694
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,819
extremes where you have one extreme of

695
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,529
people making therapeutic and medical

696
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:12,029
claims about the plant that aren't

697
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:14,309
backed by clinical aids data clinical

698
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:15,480
studies and you also have one the other

699
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,829
end of the extreme where people are

700
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,660
convinced that cannabis consumption

701
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:20,399
leads to rape violence murder and so on

702
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,600
and realistically we know neither of

703
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,830
those are really supported by science

704
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,599
the truth like most things live

705
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,889
somewhere in the middle and so that's

706
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,449
where we aim to insert ourselves so it's

707
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,840
our responsibility very particular with

708
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,610
our words and and admit where we don't

709
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:36,299
have all the facts where we're doing

710
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:37,889
more to learn more about thank you yeah

711
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,289
Rob what do you what do you see coming

712
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,700
in terms of issues whether and and you

713
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:45,859
know specific to the work that you do

714
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:49,140
well I see more of the same really I

715
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:51,959
made a career of essentially being a bit

716
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,820
of a thorn in the side of government if

717
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,579
you will in a good way

718
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,259
I've also been knowing I've helped

719
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,720
government I've recently been appointed

720
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:03,240
to a municipal cannabis task force and I

721
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,769
guess what it comes all down to is like

722
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,849
my colleagues have said it's there's

723
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:10,440
education and they're standing up for

724
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:14,709
instances involving cannabis

725
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,049
you see and injustice how ignorant you

726
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,640
see people being put down because of

727
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:23,859
their cannabis use or making false

728
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,759
assumptions do the cannabis I mean

729
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:33,459
really it's as a conscientious cannabis

730
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:38,109
user over those those situations we're

731
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:39,039
going to see certainly a lot more I look

732
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:40,449
at it this way

733
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,180
there's the folks that are getting

734
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,130
licensed sand and so on and I'm happy to

735
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,100
represent a number of those clients but

736
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,120
I also represent probably that

737
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,549
ninety-five percent who are getting

738
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,949
screwed by Health Canada so there's

739
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:59,259
gonna be no shortage of work that will

740
00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:01,330
continue unfortunately as Nick pointed

741
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:03,339
out we have and we see the from the

742
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:05,409
government a little bit more clarity in

743
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:09,789
the direction upon which they're going

744
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:14,200
to take I think continued to be a little

745
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:16,440
bit of more of the same change will

746
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,789
continue to come through courts

747
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,769
government will continue to do what it

748
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:24,309
will do in its best interest and

749
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:29,619
citizens of course have the obligation

750
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:32,740
to engage in legal methods of changing

751
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:35,019
the law but at the same time the success

752
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,960
that we've achieved with cannabis at

753
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:40,269
least in Canada Canada has come through

754
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,940
you know decades of civil disobedience

755
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:46,299
and I think we're going to see more of

756
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,940
that too so it's an exciting time for a

757
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:51,759
lawyer I mean I really look at it with

758
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,160
my law firm being you know ad lose some

759
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,890
law corporation it's my ship and I'm

760
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,220
sailing right into a perfect storm which

761
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:02,290
is exciting but if I hadn't been doing

762
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,740
what I've been doing for like the last

763
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:07,659
two decades of my practice I wouldn't be

764
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,120
ready for these changes and I believe I

765
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,430
am ready for these changes because I've

766
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:16,269
done what's been necessary every day to

767
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:21,820
prepare for these noel NBC bill c-45

768
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:22,569
sister bill c 442 because it's not that

769
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:23,980
impaired dry

770
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:26,678
I mean rates are gonna go up but charges

771
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,889
certainly our news will be tightened

772
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,778
around everybody's neck which is why

773
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:33,908
it's imperative that you understand

774
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:35,829
these laws and how they affect you

775
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:38,980
because I think you're going to realize

776
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:41,970
that cannabis regulation is going to

777
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:46,089
pervade so many aspects of human rights

778
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:49,120
civil society and and what we consider

779
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:51,849
normal tenants of being being a

780
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,898
community it will all be challenged yeah

781
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:54,730
I mean we've already seen that with

782
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:56,949
medical patients that have won the right

783
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,870
to grow but if they're renting from

784
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,788
somebody the landlord doesn't have to

785
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:03,278
let them grow on their properties so

786
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:05,109
really it's only if you have a house

787
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,750
that you can actually grow if you have

788
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:09,158
neat medicine we'll what's what's coming

789
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,069
for you guys in terms of issues or

790
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:15,850
challenges I think for the the pub Co

791
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:18,759
perspective the challenge for us is just

792
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:21,939
to stay focused there's so many

793
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:25,269
opportunities to to invest in the

794
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,389
cannabis sector and whether it's in you

795
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:31,000
know in our own backyard in Canada and

796
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:32,859
going through the the typical AC MPR

797
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,190
process and getting licensed because at

798
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:39,459
the end of the day that's your ticket to

799
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:41,139
participating in in the business - you

800
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,740
know internationally the opportunities

801
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:48,459
internationally or it could it be in in

802
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:50,319
in science and R&amp;D is it in CBD pet

803
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,288
products which were involved with with a

804
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:57,009
partnership in Israel there's so many

805
00:33:53,288 --> 00:34:00,250
opportunities that that were shown that

806
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:03,099
the the challenge for me as a CEO is

807
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,808
just to stay focused and but but that's

808
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:06,699
that's a good problem to have because we

809
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:10,960
get we have a lot of opportunities that

810
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:14,260
we we vet and and thankfully we have the

811
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,230
the capital that if we do see an

812
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,839
opportunity that we like and and and

813
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:25,210
fits the build and then we can react so

814
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:27,489
that's probably a good challenge and I'm

815
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,539
really quickly just to touch up on kind

816
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:31,269
of what all of us have been speaking

817
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:32,889
about it seems like Canada's going

818
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,318
through like Rob said at one point a

819
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:35,858
pretty grim transition it's really not

820
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:37,599
so bad

821
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:39,960
from all the challenges that you hear us

822
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,700
going through all the the ups and downs

823
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,068
it's it's quite a blessing to be a part

824
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:46,779
of this you know the fact that I'm

825
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:48,668
working with somebody like Nick who's a

826
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,530
part of the media company that's not on

827
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,299
the dispensing side the fact that I'm

828
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,429
friends with somebody like will who was

829
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,190
essentially a competition he's a

830
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,869
licensed producer which is awesome the

831
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,000
fact is that we're all up here and when

832
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:02,349
you find good people in the industry you

833
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,670
learn to work with each other and you

834
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:04,930
start putting your heads together and

835
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,000
you start doing some pretty impressive

836
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:08,169
things so I just don't want Germany to

837
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,389
think that what we're going through is

838
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,300
all trials and tribulations it's it's a

839
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:15,909
pretty awesome experience actually let

840
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,460
me qualify that it is pretty awesome and

841
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:20,289
let me make it clear we are

842
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,300
transitioning from a time where people

843
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:25,420
aren't necessarily going to jail anymore

844
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,670
for roaches or joints or you know for

845
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,858
inconsequential issues are at regarding

846
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,750
cannabis so I think we've turned a real

847
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:33,250
page there where now we're going to see

848
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,130
instead of you know the traditional

849
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,690
arrests for possession and trafficking

850
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,550
we're going to see more sophisticated

851
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,838
issues involving cannabis such as

852
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:45,430
proceeds of crime money laundering and

853
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,199
probably still the same old usual

854
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:50,169
suspects of trafficking and possession

855
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,239
but the circumstances by which people

856
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,309
will actually go to jail and where

857
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,809
families will be torn apart and where

858
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:59,318
children will be taken from their

859
00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:01,239
parents and in ministry cases I'm happy

860
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,449
to say that that's the end of Act one

861
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:06,009
and as what Clint said and with Nick and

862
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:07,779
what we're all involved in we're all

863
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,750
very fortunate to be part of what's

864
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,900
coming act to legalization it's not

865
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,670
perfect but you know it that's why I'm

866
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,670
proud to be Canadian I'm proud to be

867
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,099
here I'm proud that we're the first g7

868
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,720
country may not necessarily be proud

869
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,670
about how we're going about it but I'm

870
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,949
proud to be here and proud to be part of

871
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:28,630
this group yeah but they're always you

872
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:30,129
know mistakes made anytime a country

873
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,829
does something for the first time and so

874
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,180
we know we were obviously so proud to be

875
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:35,318
here and to be represented Canada at the

876
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:36,879
same time we recognize that though

877
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,808
differences the government

878
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,000
approaches the government could have

879
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:44,200
taken or different tactics the general

880
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,518
theme is one of optimism and and support

881
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:48,098
we just think there are certain things

882
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:49,538
obviously there can be but over time the

883
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:51,309
government and you know all the

884
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:53,140
businesses involved in the space will

885
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,180
learn from themselves and you know 5 10

886
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:56,379
15 years down the line you know

887
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,750
hopefully we'll have ironed out some of

888
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,880
those kinks and after talking to

889
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,768
government officials for a long time and

890
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,298
having them just say well I can't do

891
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:07,750
anything about your patience sorry it's

892
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:09,788
not legal that that is the biggest thing

893
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,768
when once it becomes a law there's now a

894
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:13,778
process to change it just like any other

895
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:15,308
law and so while it's not going to be

896
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:16,630
perfect and it's probably gonna be

897
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:19,630
pretty rough for the first couple of

898
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:22,269
years there's ways to fix it and improve

899
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:24,519
it now and so that's we have we have to

900
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:26,889
recognize that legalization though it

901
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:28,479
may often be purported as an event in

902
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:31,000
the media is actually not it's a process

903
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,349
and therefore it's iterative and so we

904
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,920
see the changes over time it's an

905
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:37,539
evolution it's not a marathon and and

906
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,039
we're certainly not done I mean what

907
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:40,299
we're seeing in Canada is a lot of

908
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,619
people just kind of went oh well the

909
00:37:40,298 --> 00:37:43,179
federal government's doing it now and

910
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:44,528
forgot about the provinces and how much

911
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:47,048
power they were gonna have for a little

912
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:49,389
while and they forgot about their cities

913
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:50,588
so there's cities that are saying you

914
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:53,048
know what we don't want to be part of

915
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:55,088
legalization so there's still a lot of

916
00:37:53,048 --> 00:37:57,670
work to be done on on every single level

917
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:59,500
there and we kind of can't be negligent

918
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,440
on that and and you know the other area

919
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,329
is that what we've seen in Canada is

920
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,400
what we've seen in Washington State and

921
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:08,980
what we've seen in Colorado being

922
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,139
justice is built into prohibition don't

923
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,809
actually go away with legalization you

924
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:15,639
actually have to provide incentives to

925
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:17,440
make things better for those communities

926
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:20,798
that have been paying a higher cost for

927
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,679
this all along I think we're close to

928
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,690
very close yes we have maybe five

929
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:30,068
minutes left let's hear it for the panel

930
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:33,490
one time I was that for no Q&amp;A does

931
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:35,650
anyone have any questions for the

932
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:38,469
questions over here all the way over

933
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,670
there all right I'm coming I tried to

934
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:42,578
guess that it would they would be on

935
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:47,740
this side but apparently I was close I'm

936
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:49,869
in the front quadrant but here we go

937
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:52,088
everything into the last question as

938
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,119
Hippocrates put it let my food be thy

939
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:56,289
medicine and medicine be thy food

940
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,230
cannabis is most definitely a medicinal

941
00:38:56,289 --> 00:39:02,338
food so government's often controlled by

942
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:05,500
divide and rule a drug is etymology

943
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:09,309
etymologically a dried food from the

944
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,949
Dutch drogue so my question is as we all

945
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:17,889
have an endocannabinoid system surely

946
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:20,819
all cannabis use is medicinal direct

947
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:27,460
statement is that a question so I mean

948
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:28,990
surely is is medicinal and the argument

949
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,338
obviously can be made I mean insofar as

950
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:32,559
you have that endocannabinoids system

951
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:34,150
with which all cannabinoids can interact

952
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,690
where that's phyto or endogenous

953
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,369
cannabinoids you have a central nervous

954
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,039
system that interacts with any substance

955
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:44,530
as well I mean the way I see it more is

956
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:47,230
the use case in the eyes of the consumer

957
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:49,359
so to the extent that I have friends who

958
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,619
purely enjoy the recreational and social

959
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,179
properties of cannabis

960
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,070
I would actually label them a

961
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:55,719
recreational consumer not a medical

962
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:58,900
patient even though it's therapeutic

963
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:02,139
of course of course and yeah exactly and

964
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,180
so it's in the eyes in my mind in the

965
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:05,019
eyes of the consumer but you make the

966
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:06,489
point that yes we have an

967
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:08,409
endocannabinoid system which is kind of

968
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:10,509
why the plant is has such a beautiful

969
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:12,098
harmony with our bodies well and I think

970
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,109
the whole issue is one of taxation

971
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:15,730
despite the fact that we've had legal

972
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:17,259
cannabis for a long time and the courts

973
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,000
have consistently said you have to

974
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,770
provide medical patients with access to

975
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,630
cannabis they've not called it a

976
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:25,539
medicine which is why they've been able

977
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,160
to put these taxes on it so it is kind

978
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:29,500
of a false definition that's born of

979
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,879
prohibition we you know dispensaries and

980
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,489
early activists we're trying to target

981
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,950
those that needed it desperately not

982
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:37,750
just made people's lives better right no

983
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:40,000
that's why we've ended up with this sort

984
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:42,550
of weird definition to answer your

985
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,608
question though the reason and it's very

986
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,660
important thank you for bringing

987
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:49,119
endocannabinoid and the fact that you

988
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:51,690
know regardless dr. Guevara matei would

989
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,309
would agree I think with with your

990
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,950
conclusion of cannabis being medicine

991
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:58,049
due to the fact we have an endo can

992
00:40:55,949 --> 00:41:00,419
monoid system and regardless of how it

993
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,850
was Recker met regardless but you have

994
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:06,930
to remember that out of the legal

995
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:10,019
process so again in California which set

996
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:13,469
the stage for a lot of what's going on

997
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:19,170
in Canada proposition forget the number

998
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:21,659
but again it was it was medical and 215

999
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:24,119
so you have about 45 more seconds Rob

1000
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:27,559
good luck with that

1001
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,029
I'm just going to turn over to Jamie

1002
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:31,380
well yeah well we'll all be around

1003
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,300
you're gonna get a lot more Canadian

1004
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,099
panels coming out so our goal was again

1005
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,250
cut to kind of just give an overview of

1006
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,809
what kind of things you can expect where

1007
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,000
you're gonna get sudden opposition from

1008
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:46,049
senators or from certain pounds and

1009
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,730
things like that one more time for the

1010
00:41:46,050 --> 00:42:00,369
panel is in for Jamie and Clint's

1011
00:41:47,730 --> 00:42:00,369
