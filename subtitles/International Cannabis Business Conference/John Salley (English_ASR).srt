00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,990

43
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:20,280
2005 my boy got 20 years in jail for

44
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,909
making sure that the weed in New York

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,750
smelled like California you'll get that

46
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,169
in a second

47
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,520
so I've been literally trying to help

48
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,109
people before that

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,480
I was trying to get them out of the

50
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,030
business because I thought that they

51
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,909
shouldn't be selling that because I

52
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:44,750
didn't smoke weed at that time and start

53
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:49,530
smoking until 2000 I was in Sacramento

54
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:51,539
38-24-36 and I and she said you'll get

55
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,060
that joke is on the back of it and she

56
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,799
said do you smoke weed and I said nah

57
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,780
you know I don't do that stuff and she

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,950
was like I believe it I was like let me

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,860
try that let me call my wife and tell

60
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:08,009
I'm going to sleep I'm joking I told I

61
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,820
was going out but I smoked this weed and

62
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:13,649
my left leg became my right leg and and

63
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,799
I do yoga and all of a sudden I was

64
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,129
doing things different I was in one form

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,719
I was like yo this is the bomb so the

66
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,789
next day I get up with my teammates and

67
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,370
I was like yeah I'm the last one on the

68
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:31,739
bus which is usually not happen I get on

69
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:34,610
the bus and I sit down that was the

70
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:38,550
chronic Sal I told you not to smoke it I

71
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:41,120
was like we I get the chronic like I

72
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,219
have chronic pain where do I get that I

73
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,469
found this out a month before retiring

74
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,750
now if I would have found this out when

75
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:52,169
I was a bad boy I might have you know

76
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,319
hit more people I would still be playing

77
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:59,339
so Tom Brady smokes a lot of weed

78
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:02,519
obviously cuz there's no way to play

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,520
this unbelievable [ __ ] and not smoke

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,969
weed you can't drink alcohol because and

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,070
you can't just keep eating bad food

82
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:13,469
right because it destroys your your body

83
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,299
destroys your liver your kidneys your

84
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,670
relationship you make you smack your

85
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,150
kids kiss your dog you don't want

86
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,290
alcohol you want this so I've been in

87
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,739
this for a long time

88
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,600
I've heard just about everything guys

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,610
have no idea

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,120
when I hear them speaking gibberish or

91
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,430
where I hear them speaking in in what I

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,149
call MBC talk pivoting and this and that

93
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:41,850
when I hear that [ __ ] I go I don't

94
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,229
want you in the business I don't and I

95
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,760
just had a conversation where the guy in

96
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,830
the back was asking how he can help

97
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,870
regulate I think we should go back to

98
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:51,569
the mentality when weed was never

99
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,699
thought of of being dirty never thought

100
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,339
of of being bad for you never thought of

101
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,589
having herbicides pesticides only when

102
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,709
we try to scale up to fulfill

103
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,989
everybody's dream of being wealthy I'm

104
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,069
sorry rich

105
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,769
because that's all you're gonna get if

106
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:10,639
you scale up to 80 hundred thousand to

107
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:15,870

I can't pronounce this [ __ ] that was the

138
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,870
first thing I did and like I think it

139
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,729
was 2008 so we could teach this business

140

141
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,839
can keep the corporates gonna come in

142
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,579

obviously you can tell so I used to be I

164
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:44,829
had I had a filter because I've been on

165
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:47,168
television so long so I would know to

166
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:49,478
take it to the edge and then fade back

167
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:53,258
and if he went a little bit too over the

168
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:55,389
edge I would say sorry and somebody

169
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,960
would write an apology but I did

170
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:00,338
ayahuasca at this very very wealthy guy

171
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,109
in Beverly Hills

172
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:04,838
he was so wealthy he bought a shaman

173
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,270
from the middle of the Amazon he like

174
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:09,310
landed a helicopter grabbed a shaman

175
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:10,120

176
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,228
know how we like it

177
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,180
and and short enough I was into one

178
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,158
ayahuasca and I'm watching all the [ __ ]

179
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,259
happening in my brain and the colors and

180
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:26,168
I start laughing and [ __ ] that happened

181
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:30,580
in 1979 and I realized this is healing

182
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:31,568
my brain that ayahuasca made me see

183
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,509
things differently

184
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,709
it made me open up it made me you know I

185
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,658
was introverted yeah I would have never

186
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,759
gotten up on the stage to lie it again.i

187
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:44,458

188
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:47,230
gotten up and spoke so much truth in fun

189
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,879

190
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,170
not gonna get up and tell you what you

191
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,909

192
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,870
thing I'm asking you to do is keep the

193
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:55,120

want to do some liquor i met somebody

197
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:05,588
yesterday was talking about infusing the

198
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:10,060

00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:15,099
is down 30% wine is down 50% and that's

201
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,528
not because people don't drink it's

202
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,540
because people now realize this is how

203
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:23,980
you should enhance your brain this is

204
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:26,559
how you should literally feed everything

205
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,100
that's inside your body by smoking it by

206
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:32,049
vaping it by eating it by sharing it

207
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,820
