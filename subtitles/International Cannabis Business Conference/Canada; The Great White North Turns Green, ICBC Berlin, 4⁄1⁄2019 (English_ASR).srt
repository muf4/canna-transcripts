here and I try and talk a little German

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,350
when I come to show respect for local

11
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,149
German friends so when I first got here

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,890

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,039
second year last year I tried something

00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,349
different I said we'll come in DeLand

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,019

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,160
site so they said ok it's a little bit

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,609
better that's a little bit better right

23
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,349
a little bit better and then this year

24
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,179
because I have such a trouble after he

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,189
go to the bars to find a bathroom it's

26
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,250
so hard to find a bathroom in Berlin so

27
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:04,558
they taught me in shooting good

28
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:07,560
vous etes de Toilette da so a little bit

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,090
better a little bit better there so just

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,710
really really special also be sharing

31
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,390
the stage we had a legend here earlier

32
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,030
professor raff film of shulam who was

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,290
one of my heroes I'm a cannabis educator

34
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,150
so I've been talking about him for so

35
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,130
long so it's awesome to see him and we

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,380
had so many other legends here Hillary

37
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,969
black John Conroy mark we're all legends

38
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,310
from Canada so it's awesome to share

39
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,478
this this amazing stage and we got an

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,250
amazing panel which we'll get to in a

41
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,450
second but I wanted to point out since I

42
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,340
was last here a lot of things have

43
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,540
happened since we were last here we now

44
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,280
have medical and pharmacies we now have

45
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,750
extracts and edibles announced we'll see

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,118
when that actually happens but it was

47
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,310
announced we had legalization in retail

48
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,978
in fact today in my province of Ontario

49
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,049
is the first day of sales I'm waiting to

50
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,009
see some pictures of all the lineups we

51
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,720
were supposed to have a lot of stores

52
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,849
open some of them were an open little

53
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,109
sensitive subject for certain panelists

54
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:57,688
here we'll talk about that in a moment

55
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,849
and we also had the amnesty program

56
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,468
discussed where we're gonna remove

57
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:02,849
people's criminal records for their

58
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,228
cannabis so that should be really

59
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,030
interesting and we'll see how that goes

60
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:07,170
so maybe next year on our panel we'll

61
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,729
talk more about that but I wanted to

62
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,318
start with a few stats I think everyone

63
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,110
was really interested I gave some stats

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,679
last year and I said I really liked it

65
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,939
but try to

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
a little slower with the stats because

67
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:18,060
they were trying to write it down I'll

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,650
tell you all the stats after but I'll

69
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,259
just want to throw a few out with

70
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,780
patience the last numbers from September

71
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,459
were 342 thousand patients we estimate

72
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,769
there's above 400,000 patients right now

73
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,620
on the medical side with about 124

74
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,789
thousand shipments sent at that point

75
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,139
when it comes to how many doctors and

76
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,209
healthcare practitioners when I got in

77
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,340
the industry in 2013 there was about 40

78
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,650
or so doctors prescribing we now how

79
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,019
last month or the last month of recorded

80
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,938
about January 3500 doctors or healthcare

81
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,530
practitioners prescribe so we're getting

82
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:49,560
a little bit better an estimated about

83
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,318
14,000 in total have prescribed so we've

84
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,469
come a long way also on the medical side

85
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,208
products from January 9th 2019 we had

86
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:59,968
about 7,000 kilograms of dried cannabis

87
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,680
sold in that month which is a little bit

88
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,810
down which have some theories on but we

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
could talk about it later and about 7800

90
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,829
liters of oil which is an increase of 48

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,199
percent so we see a lot of uptick in oil

92
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:13,230
on the medical cannabis side and dry

93
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,030
flour is being kind of looked at now on

94
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:16,590
the retail and rec side so possibly some

95
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,870
some people were putting it aside for

96
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,639
that and the last couple stats when I

97
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,289
first came here my first year we had

98
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,479
about 40 licensed producers when I first

99
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,848
came on the stage last year we had 97

100
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,819
licensed producers and today we set at

101
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,500
about 143 licensed producers and the

102
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,509
last that I wanted to point out is that

103
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,120
the exports which is a little bit of a

104
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:39,030
sensitive subject here I imagine so they

105
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,349
peaked in in May of 2018 where we sent

106
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,930
about 339 kilos of dry flour in August

107
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:49,500
of this year we sent zero and in

108
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,090
September we sent one one liter one

109
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,959
liter of oil so sorry again

110
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,938
118 liters at one point in the peak

111
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,919
August we had zero and in September we

112
00:03:56,938 --> 00:04:00,568
sent one liter of oil so it is

113
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,250
unfortunate we definitely feel the pain

114
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:04,619
of what we're hearing when it comes to

115
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,509
all this now to get into our panel why

116
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,370
don't we start with an introduction of

117
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:09,929
our esteemed panelists I'm very excited

118
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,128
every year I bring a great panel but I'm

119
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,780
very excited about this one in

120
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:15,358
particular even if you want to start us

121
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,779
off yeah cool thanks for the the context

122
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,788
there Alex yeah my name is Ian dick I am

123
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:24,388
the head of partnerships for regulated

124
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:25,918
industries within Shopify so I kind of

125
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,379
helped steer the company toward this

126
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,329
this market a few years

127
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:34,500
seeing the opportunity in our country

128
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:37,769
the sort of legislative open lane if you

129
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,920
want to call it to apply what we already

130
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:44,729
do in more broadly in the Commerce world

131
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,150
specifically to cannabis you know we

132
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,439
kind of Ted ourselves as an

133
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,859
entrepreneurship company allowing

134
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,759
entrepreneurs to sell any product to

135
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,400
consumers where they want to buy them

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,019
whether that's on an online store at a

137
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,939
point of sale or like through social

138
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:04,259
channels we're kind of there for them

139
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:06,209
and then so then more recently we've had

140
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,649
some success success in the cannabis

141
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:12,449
space in Canada specifically helping

142
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,529
licensed producers verdict vertically

143
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,300
integrated licensed producers sell

144
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,779
directly to their patients as well as

145
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,100
powering some of the recreational

146
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:25,259
operations both government and private

147
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,910
in country my name is Stephen verbeek

148
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm the founder of hello cannabis

149
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,450
medical and education centers it's my

150
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,689
third time in Germany so thank you again

151
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:36,389
for for having me here we originally

152
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,219
started with a one mandate which was to

153
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,930
help D stigmatize cannabis and to be

154
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,790
able to help educate physicians and

155
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,480
essentially connect three dots that's

156
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,129
the patient's with physicians in product

157
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,170
this started about seven years ago it

158
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,959
has now evolved into eight different

159
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,640
projects in three continents and it's

160
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,169
been lovely we actually have a working

161
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,360
relationship with everybody on this

162
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,220
panel in some degree shape or form

163
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,800
Canada has a wonderful collaborative

164
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,470
effort that's been in my opinion a

165
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,910
moving target that we are all lovingly

166
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,650
trying to navigate through and

167
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,510
collaborate through in that we are

168
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,819
seeing some of the same challenges in

169
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:14,189
Europe so we are very much hoping to be

170
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,810
able to help the European and other

171
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,300
markets around the world learn from our

172
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,589
mistakes so we can help roll out at both

173
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,120
medical and eventually a adult use

174
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:26,459
market where everybody is able to

175
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,040
benefit from a plant that I see is one

176
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:32,579
of the most disruptive entities that our

177
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,830
world has currently seen thank you thank

178
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:39,149
you hello my name's teri Roycroft I'm

179
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:41,128
founder and CEO of MC RCI we are a

180
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,649
educational resource center

181
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:45,838
as well we started about 11 years ago in

182
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:49,139
Canada being one of the first clinics of

183
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:51,809
its kind we've been able to you know

184
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,610
stay within the different programs that

185
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:54,659
have happened through Canada through

186
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,309
Canada we've had three different

187
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:58,678
programs we've navigated them all to the

188
00:06:56,309 --> 00:07:01,919
current a CMP our we train physicians

189
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:04,318
educate patients and are currently

190
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,389
looking again internationally here just

191
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,519
bring some of the SOPs and some of the

192
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:10,588
knowledge that we've had to some of the

193
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,259
countries over here that have not had a

194
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:16,199
chance to get education and just rolling

195
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,749
into the medical regime right now so

196
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,528
when we started there was one supplier

197
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:24,269
there was one clinic and we've seen it

198
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:26,968
now grow to as alex was saying through

199
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:29,668
the other stats here you know 145 LPS

200
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:31,649
numerous doctors and clinics using the

201
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:34,399
same type of model and supporting

202
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:36,838
patients across the country we do

203
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,028
telemedicine as well as walk-in clinics

204
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:41,129
so that we can support patients that

205
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:42,738
cannot make it to clinics and patients

206
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,990
that want to continue with a

207
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:49,528
face-to-face interview or appointment

208
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,778
with doctors cataria Andrew my name is

209
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:56,338
Andrew Muir off and I am a recovering

210
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:57,689
lawyer I have I'm also a cannabis

211
00:07:56,338 --> 00:08:00,300
patient medical cannabis patient I've

212
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:03,539
been a patient since 2015 I'm the CEO of

213
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,269
stream print technologies we are a data

214
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:07,978
analytics company in Canada that helps

215
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:11,278
patients to track their medical outcomes

216
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:14,639
using technology using an app all data

217
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:17,759
is anonymous we track basically pre and

218
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,408
post symptomatic State against route of

219
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,968
administration against the dose and then

220
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:22,889
against the full chemical profile of the

221
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,569
product so we don't care whether it's an

222
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,490
OG Kush or we don't care what you decide

223
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,718
to call it we care what's the actual

224
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,629
ingredients of the products that you're

225
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:32,219
taking at the time our platform is HIPPA

226
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:36,209
HIPPA and Fitbit a compliant and will

227
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,639
soon be gdpr compliant we have the only

228
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:40,588
business analytics platform that sits on

229
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,990
top of a real data set so today we have

230
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:44,850
over 1.2 million patient reported

231
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,720
outcomes it's the largest set of its

232
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,180
kind in the world

233
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,309
and we feel very fortunate to have grown

234
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:52,049
that that's tens of thousands of

235
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:53,519
Canadian patients who are tracking every

236
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:57,208
single day

237
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,789
and so we power a lot of decision-making

238
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:03,028
across the industry in Canada licensed

239
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,528
producers clinics clinics are able to

240
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:06,389
track their patients performance in real

241
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:08,070
time licensed producers are able to see

242
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:09,750
what products they should be carrying in

243
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,430
their product set and doctors are able

244
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,899
to see what products are working for

245
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:18,569
what and we today have the only solution

246
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,120
that's in place in a pharmacy in Canada

247
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,920
and that's that solution basically helps

248
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,179
that pharmacy to deliver the right

249
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,528
treatment recommendations for their

250
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,419
patients and I just want to recognize

251
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:28,950
for one second if I can a couple of

252
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,110
pioneers in the Canadian industry John

253
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,790
Conroy and Jerry Roycroft here there are

254
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,919
others in the room and I feel that we

255
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:36,990
should all be thankful that they've put

256
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,969
in their time over the last 20 or so

257
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,519
years to make this industry possible in

258
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,019
Canada and then I think that our

259
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,189
experience in Canada has really helped

260
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,480
to influence what's happening the rest

261
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,580
of the world right now that's a good

262
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,230
point and a lot of people grinded their

263
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,730
teeth took a lot of bullets for us to be

264
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,278
here and I always like to acknowledge

265
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,310
that when so quick around applause for

266
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,289
yes John Conroy dr. mark where when he

267
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:59,909
was at he was a doctor doing education

268
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:01,889
that he was gentlemen speaking earlier

269
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:04,110
he was going to talks when no one wanted

270
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,789
to hear him talk and when I was doing my

271
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,100
education I'll be completely honest I

272
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:10,409
would actually say dr. mark ware says

273
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,550
and dr. mark swears research so I would

274
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,439
kind of hide behind him he'd be my

275
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:14,849
shield because they could put maybe try

276
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,410
to poke holes in what I said but I knew

277
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,700
he was very smart and I knew that it

278
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,429
would be very hard to poke holes in what

279
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,500
he said so so let's talk about access to

280
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:25,259
cannabis access to cannabis has actually

281
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,850
changed since I was last year and we now

282
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,350
have different retail experiences we

283
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,820
have it on the medical side we now have

284
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,528
some pharmacies also carrying it and

285
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,720
then we have the adult use or

286
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:35,519
recreational side where that's also

287
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,139
another way that's being sold so and

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,639
every province has their own rules which

289
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,199
is very frustrating but at the same time

290
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,759
I feel like Germany will can appreciate

291
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,560
this because there's also different

292
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,480
provinces with different rules so if we

293
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,129
just talk about the different retail

294
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,320
experience in how medical versus rec

295
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,730
looks like in Canada and someone wants

296
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,660
to start us off to kind of give their

297
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,100
thoughts on it so I held of cannabis is

298
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:58,199
actually very fortunate to be involved

299
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,540
on on both sides of this as I stated

300
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,040
before our original mandate was to be

301
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,799
able to help connect the three dots of

302
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,539
physicians patients and product it has

303
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,589
evolved where we were fortunate enough

304
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,199
to partner with

305
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,690
of the 25 lottery winners to open up one

306
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,840
of the first retail stores in in the

307
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,640
province of Ontario so our original

308
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,590
mandate was to try and truly

309
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,419
differentiate between medical and

310
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,280
recreational because it's it's quite

311
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,169
interesting when it's the same plant and

312
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,720
often the same product that straddles

313
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:29,399
both of those sides I'm a medical user

314
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,350
now I will candidly say that there are

315
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,149
times where I use it recreationally as

316
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,279
well and I don't pretend that I'm

317
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,799
actually medicating the analogy that I

318
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,779
say is no doctor is ever going to tell

319
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,879
somebody that is suffering from pain to

320
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,039
go buy a brown bag of heroin and put it

321
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,419
in a needle and shoot up now I'm not

322
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,509
saying that you are not extracting

323
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,789
medicine from that just like when you

324
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,740
are rolling up a royal joint which is a

325
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:54,750
dried flower in a bleach sheet of white

326
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,430
paper with glue something else that I

327
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,860
don't think many doctors would actually

328
00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:00,779
would like somebody to medicate with I'm

329
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,850
not denouncing that you are extracting

330
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,649
medicine from that but there's a reason

331
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,889
why over 90% of the patients with hello

332
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,059
cannabis are using sublingual oils so I

333
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:10,649
do believe that we need to have a

334
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,839
separation between medical and

335
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,850
recreation and when you are able to do

336
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,830
that you're able to facilitate all of

337
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,680
the different medical medical and adult

338
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,280
use users and you were able to start

339
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,069
differentiating different product

340
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,049
selection very great point yeah I mean

341
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,210
those are all fantastic points and I

342
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:31,049
fully agree as far as shopify is

343
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,190
concerned you know we in terms of like

344
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,379
the software that's involved or the

345
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,260
solution that's involved the the two

346
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:40,169
experiences we're trying to like make

347
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:44,610
them somewhat similar and what I mean by

348
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:45,839
that is when you're looking at a the

349
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,500
customer journey the patient journey

350
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:52,019
through online buying experience what

351
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,370
we're trying to do is tailor it to what

352
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,110
the what the LP is trying to do is

353
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,659
tailor it to the the patient as much as

354
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,190
they can so that the the products that

355
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,539
they see and the amounts that they can

356
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,100
purchase are conducive to their

357
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,279
prescription information it's a very

358
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,500
personalized buying experience and I

359
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,629
think recreation recreational cannabis

360
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,200
is wants to achieve that same thing they

361
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:15,769
want to to educate the consumer and to

362
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,360
have these personalized experiences

363
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,819
because you know we were talking about

364
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,919
this the backstage but

365
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,590
you know the the level of understanding

366
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,979
of the product still has so far to go so

367
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:31,790
that people understand what dosage and

368
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,129
what potency is gonna work best for them

369
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:36,929
and so you know I really it's it's

370
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,919
really excited it's exciting time right

371
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:39,329
now because I think there's a lot of

372
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,399
innovation happening in that space you

373
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,560
know you look not to put it on blast but

374
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,569
drew over there is it with strain print

375
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,599
is is effectively trying to do that try

376
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,650
to unlock the secrets of this plant and

377
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,779
allow people to understand how it

378
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,889
affects their body and what's good for

379
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,089
them and what's potentially bad for them

380
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,039
there's there's other those are other

381
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,780
people trying to do this as well for

382
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:01,110
shop fights part we want to kind of be

383
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,360
this central hub that these technologies

384
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,080
can build into to then be like layered

385
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,399
into the the commerce experience and

386
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,759
overall just like lift up the industry

387
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,549
through education so what's interesting

388
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,740
is this we had a different experiences

389
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:20,159
with our patients before legalization

390
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,500
came to Canada there was still a lack of

391
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,079
education and lack of information that a

392
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,799
lot of patients wanted but when it

393
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,210
became legal we saw an increase in

394
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,559
people coming to see us we thought it

395
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,269
was going to be the opposite at first

396
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,719
but what happened is a lot of these

397
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:38,730
people felt more empowered to go and try

398
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,920
cannabis once it became legal even

399
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:44,399
though the program was in place for the

400
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:47,069
previous 18 years people still weren't

401
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,659
aware that there was this this access to

402
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,790
it and we're talking a lot about seniors

403
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:53,699
now so we've seen a huge influx in

404
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:56,039
patients coming medical they've gone to

405
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,379
their recreational stores and by law

406
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,120
they're not allowed to give any medical

407
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,519
information or even relate a certain

408
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,139
strain to a specific illness and that's

409
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,909
where a lot of people have been turned

410
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,439
around and are now coming back to the

411
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:09,959
medical side so they can actually get

412
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
that information and we've seen quite an

413
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,320
increase in that and usually as the

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,750
seniors mark it's a fast and growing

415
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,640
segment that we've seen now and when

416
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,330
they walk into a recreational store ask

417
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,559
for information they are now being

418
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,030
directed either out the door because

419
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,049
they can't be of American or we're

420
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,610
working with some of these groups

421
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:29,459
putting this together so that they can

422
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,500
direct them to a medical clinic to get

423
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,990
more information on it so it is very

424
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,690
interesting that that amount of

425
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,310
increase in patient flow once we were

426
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,300
illegal it was very interesting we

427
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,189
thought it was gonna be the office of

428
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:44,370
him we saw the same experience what

429
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,930
after after the program was announced or

430
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,789
after the program launched in October we

431
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:49,979
saw an increase in in what we're calling

432
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:52,559
elder care so it's basically yes as well

433
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,500
yeah so an older demographic who's more

434
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,088
open to using cannabis and and

435
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,089
across-the-board are interested in

436
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,290
getting off of part of the poly Pharma

437
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,480
you know that's the concept of having

438
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:06,329
multiple medications for the same

439
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,330
symptom one to offset the other so we're

440
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,480
seeing a lot of that on our side too

441
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,830
okay

442
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,930
excellent thank you very much for them

443
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,580
great answers and one thing that's also

444
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,719
very important that we find in Canada

445
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,660
and it's gonna be very important here in

446
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,980
Germany is the issue of a compliance

447
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:22,230
compliance can be your best friend but

448
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,610
it can also be your enemy I wanted some

449
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,289
would hear from the panelists some of

450
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,269
the things that they see what are the

451
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:29,219
good things about being in have elated a

452
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,509
heavily regulated market and one of some

453
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,920
things that can potentially hurt in a

454
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:34,439
heavily regulated market an important

455
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,120
thing to note is you can be as compliant

456
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,070
as you want but your partners that you

457
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,929
work with also have to be in compliance

458
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,400
so just some thoughts about some pros

459
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:43,229
and cons about being compliant and the

460
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,338
importance of making sure that your

461
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,080
partner is complying because anything

462
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,430
they do actually hurts you as well and

463
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,759
roof you want to start us off so we're

464
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:53,189
working with some of the largest both

465
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:56,189
government and private entities in

466
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:59,010
Canada on driving what we call

467
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,920
transparency and and standardization for

468
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:04,558
products right now we don't actually

469
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,539
have consistency among the licensed

470
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,539
producers on what they label in their

471
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,009
products and what they share with

472
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,509
respect to expand and cannabinoids and

473
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,679
turkeys a very important that we

474
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,299
understand that patients want to know

475
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,360
what's in their products doctors want to

476
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,529
know what are in those products and

477
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,159
that's now gonna be driven from the top

478
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:24,838
levels down where the pharmacies are

479
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,160
saying we need to know what's in these

480
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,318
products or we're not gonna recommend

481
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,330
them and Health Canada which is the

482
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,889
governing board that actually decides

483
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,720
what gets bought and sold and who's

484
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,170
licensed they also would like to see

485
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,339
that they would like to see the industry

486
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,009
regulate themselves but that's not

487
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:43,169
happening right now so there will be a

488
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:45,059
little bit of a push from industry to

489
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,710
drive that end government to drive that

490
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,589
down and we

491
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,240
see from our perspective is when we're

492
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:54,629
working with LPS and any of the other

493
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,849
peripheral groups that we work with is

494
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,580
sometimes that lack of consistency so

495
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:01,558
for instance we are working with

496
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,480
patients we recommend a certain strain

497
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,639
the physician does our aftercare

498
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,950
specials help them go to that location

499
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,230
or that that particular LP but if that

500
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,880
LP has some kind of a recall or they've

501
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,649
got mold and mildew where something's

502
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,960
happen to that product that directly

503
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:17,428
affects the companies underneath it so

504
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,808
as we're working conjunction with them

505
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,330
something like that would really affect

506
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:23,369
it our reputations as well we'd make

507
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:25,470
recommendations to a certain group and

508
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:27,359
they've got inferior product and that is

509
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,089
where you know working in a partnership

510
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:33,269
everyone has to be on on point and if

511
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:35,398
one of that pieces of the chain is is

512
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:37,528
broken well that creates an issue for

513
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:41,489
the whole chain to supply the patient's

514
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:44,579
the doctors everyone gets in impacted by

515
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,069
that link being broken and it can happen

516
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:48,298
on any one of the steps of that chain

517
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,769
that goes around the physician to be

518
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:51,329
giving wrong information that could be

519
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:54,058
wrong product and so it's really

520
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:55,439
important for all of us groups to work

521
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:57,298
together and have a consistent

522
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,169
understanding of what we're supplying

523
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:02,730
and our roles in the that change so that

524
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,230
everyone gets the medicine they need and

525
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,140
it's consistent and it's safe at that

526
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:10,048
point absolutely I have to completely

527
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,090
concur with what Terry's saying here we

528
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:14,129
are basically the frontline for patients

529
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:17,129
so if a patient is a upset or unhappy

530
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,539
with their product hello cannabis or mmm

531
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,520
CRC I are the people that have that

532
00:19:18,538 --> 00:19:22,859
hearing so if we recommend a product in

533
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,538
that product is not as its stated or it

534
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,189
runs out and we've run into many supply

535
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,658
issues in Canada we're the ones that

536
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,610
face the brunt of it and unfortunately

537
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,860
our bottom line insolvency is dependent

538
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:33,898
on that so to come full circle back to

539
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:37,648
Alex's original question with respect to

540
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:39,418
regulation and I see a value in somewhat

541
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,769
having an unregulated system but of

542
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,020
course it needs to have a balance with

543
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:44,639
regulatory systems so when you're

544
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,288
looking at a medical component clearly

545
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,700
you can't have an unregulated market it

546
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:49,440
opens up the ability for the black

547
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,630
market to take in and you lack that

548
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,759
consistency in standardization which is

549
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,559
required with the medical product now

550
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,480
with a regulated product that are a

551
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:00,058
regulated industry you can start getting

552
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,460
this over-regulation which limits the

553
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:02,019
ability

554
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,029
for these LPS to be able to create that

555
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:06,339
supply chain and to be able to create

556
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,049
that quality that patients want so

557
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,909
finding that balance between an over

558
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,470
regulated market in an under regulated

559
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,630
market in my opinion is one of the

560
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,250
pivotal things that the European markets

561
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,830
really need to look at and unfortunately

562
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,869
I don't have the full answer for that we

563
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:21,250
are navigating through it it is a moving

564
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:23,079
target but you need to find a balance

565
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,880
where you are able to keep a

566
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,500
standardized product that is regulated

567
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,780
where you can confidently have

568
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,490
physicians back this product and have

569
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:32,170
companies and clinics like ourselves to

570
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,700
be able to support this product while

571
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,200
not restricting them from being able to

572
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,360
create a supply chain that could break

573
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,269
because once that chain is broken to any

574
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,379
of the one link in that chain is broken

575
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:42,910
everybody feels it and that's why we're

576
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,020
all a collaborative effort here and why

577
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,820
all of us work together

578
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,549
good good point to you yeah and I mean

579
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:51,189
that that's absolutely true I think that

580
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,879
touch on a few points but like my to my

581
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,650
point about consumer education

582
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,870
compliance is required in order to

583
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,880
create a consistent reproducible product

584
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,139
that then when you when you understand

585
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,780
these things about it it's going to be

586
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,440
consistent each time you use it with

587
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:06,970
with with our for our part we try to

588
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,910
strike this exact balance that Stephens

589
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,950
talking about of you know create as

590
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,150
frictionless a buying experience as we

591
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,730
possibly can

592
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,740
Wow also adhering to the strict

593
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,299
regulations and I think it's a it's sort

594
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,950
of a it is exactly that it's an ongoing

595
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:24,240
conversation it's a moving target and

596
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,410
it's it's it's that that is informed by

597
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,789
events like this where we all get

598
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,590
together and we talk about it and we

599
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:31,649
share things that have worked and things

600
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:33,849
that haven't worked and hopefully

601
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,850
legislators and regulators look to the

602
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:38,889
market and and try to you know intake

603
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,939
ingest information from that to make

604
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,430
sure that it is this collaborative

605
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,970
process where we're we're kind of

606
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,680
working to the craft this because as you

607
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,140
say striking that balance is key because

608
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,750
the unregulated market the black market

609
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,870
is not beholding to any of these things

610
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:59,220
and so the it's much more frictionless

611
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:01,929
so it is a it is a challenge there's a

612
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,870
cross provincial a B test going on right

613
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,490
now in Canada that we will share the

614
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,019
results of when it's a little further

615
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,109
along and we should have some updates on

616
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,519
that next year but to that point we've

617
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:14,229
learned a lot of lessons we've been at

618
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,569
this for about six years as an industry

619
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,450
started in 2013 and we've learned a lot

620
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:21,159
and we've made some mistakes and I think

621
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,600
Germany and other emerging markets can

622
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,880
learn from some other mistakes and maybe

623
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,469
Stephen you want to start it off with

624
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,280
some of the mistakes that we've made and

625
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,980
what we've learned it's not fair you

626
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:36,069
know all about mistakes it's a long long

627
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,269
list so I can say some of the mistakes

628
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:39,909
that we saw from a regulatory

629
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,990
perspective is again circling right back

630
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,360
to this over-regulation

631
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,000
it's very challenging for LPS to be able

632
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,149
to increase their capacity say you

633
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,589
bought a 40,000 square foot facility

634
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,240
that was not it that's certainly not

635
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:54,069
enough to be able to facilitate a large

636
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,870
medical market and when you create so

637
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:58,029
much regulation that you cannot expand

638
00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:00,729
this your supply chain gets completely

639
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:02,678
broken down I would say one of the one

640
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,470
of the personal mistakes that I made as

641
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,509
a business was one not being able to

642
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,509
facilitate proper funding for

643
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:12,519
scalability if I can give a personal

644
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:16,808
experience with respect to my failures a

645
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:18,609
young CEO a lot of CEOs I find they're

646
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:20,168
drawn to empowering people and hiring

647
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:21,879
people that they see potential in and

648
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:23,919
there's something really special about

649
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,200
seeing talent being able to foster and

650
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,850
nurture that talent and see them exceed

651
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,400
their own expectations of what you

652
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:31,959
expect out of them as well that that's

653
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,570
one of my favorite parts about being a

654
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,730
leader one big mistake I made is when

655
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:38,558
you have 13 people that you empower and

656
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,720
you see big talent and they also see you

657
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,950
as a leader in more or less the nucleus

658
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,750
of all of this knowledge and

659
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,340
unfortunately they need your leadership

660
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,710
and your knowledge to be able to do that

661
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:49,329
so it's completely unscalable when you

662
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,890
have 13 people that are looking at you

663
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,269
to be able to lead them every single day

664
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,490
while you're also trying to scale a

665
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:56,079
company well I thought you were gonna

666
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,730
say that everything's been perfect and

667
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,710
then we may be full everyone it's April

668
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,480
Fool's but I guess you didn't want to

669
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,970
make that joke that's also the second

670
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,980
mistake I've know mistakes right now so

671
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,319
I'm off to a great start Alex thanks for

672
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,440
reminding me yeah I was gonna say like

673
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,849
that's that I like your story there I

674
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,789
you know tend to try to surround myself

675
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:18,219
with people that are way smarter than me

676
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:21,759
so that you know it doesn't all land on

677
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,089
me so that's all I'll add to that that's

678
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,769
a blooper reel yea those blooper Terry

679
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:30,740
so one of the mistakes that we kind of

680
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:34,369
participated in very earlier stages was

681
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,519
the the lack of being able to work in

682
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:41,449
conjunction with the colleges for the

683
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,789
doctors they need to get up to speed

684
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,200
much quicker and get more education and

685
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:47,059
this is when in the earlier days was

686
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,460
very difficult because the doctors were

687
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:51,109
being actually reprimanded and told not

688
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,850
to support cannabis even though there

689
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:56,179
was a legal program in the country to do

690
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:57,949
that and so when you've got the the

691
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,720
medical body saying this is not a

692
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,400
quantified medicine there's not enough

693
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,740
studies and you've got the ability for

694
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,470
doctors to do it and thousands of

695
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,720
patients asking those doctors this was a

696
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,150
real challenge one of the breakdowns

697
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,730
that we saw in regards to be able to

698
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,080
support those patients and you know as

699
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,700
we go around the country and we're

700
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:18,889
seeing the resistance we still see some

701
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,620
physicians even with the large demand

702
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,630
for product that is one of the you know

703
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:25,069
the challenges that we have that I see

704
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,900
that we need to really push forward on

705
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:28,460
getting more education of those doctors

706
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,750
and the colleges themselves even though

707
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,000
you have doctors that are willing to do

708
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,470
it the colleges need to take a look a

709
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,890
closer look at this so they can actually

710
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:39,710
support that initiative rather than

711
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:42,110
resist it in Canada the CMA Canadian

712
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,180
Medical Association was had a statement

713
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,219
the president stated or that the CEO

714
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,870
stated at one time that they were glad

715
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,180
at recreational was coming in because

716
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:51,469
they wouldn't have to follow through

717
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,610
with the medical program and in fact

718
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,220
they should get rid of the medical

719
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:58,159
program so this is something that was

720
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,559
very serious in in our side of it to

721
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,269
have someone of that nature come out

722
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,799
with a statement like that because

723
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,089
there's no way medical is going to

724
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,490
disappear there's too many patients

725
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:09,740
there's too much benefit and what we see

726
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,710
is a direct separation of this industry

727
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,049
the exact same plant being used for two

728
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,579
different segments and a lot of people

729
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,839
think when you're growing cannabis to

730
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:19,189
growing medical cannabis you're going

731
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,409
recreational cannabis that's not the

732
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,289
cases the same product being processed

733
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,480
at the end of that grow period to

734
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:29,649
facilitate either one of those markets

735
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,150
and that's a breakdown in the medical

736
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,730
regime that we see and I think you know

737
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,610
anyone taking lessons from that and from

738
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:40,160
Canada would be would be looking at that

739
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:41,509
to get the education from the colleges

740
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,490
to get on board more

741
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,750
right and education is the magic word we

742
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,190
are gonna talk about that in a second

743
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,808
and uh I'll talk about the CMA in a

744
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:53,240
moment but to answer any thoughts on

745
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:55,609
that question I have to I have to I have

746
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,179
to reiterate what Terry was saying when

747
00:26:55,609 --> 00:27:01,099
the CMA doesn't support the cause it

748
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:03,169
really puts a damper on the good work

749
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:05,418
that people are doing too and and the

750
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,090
the improvements that thousands of

751
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,980
patients are seeing on a daily basis so

752
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:12,589
get your medical associations onside and

753
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,509
educated as fast as possible yeah I got

754
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,609
you've got to remember when that comes

755
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:19,308
from a source like that patients that

756
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:20,719
are hearing that are now maybe reluctant

757
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:22,460
to go down that path when they hear one

758
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,048
of the top authorities making those

759
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,058
statements and that's not fair to the

760
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:27,679
patients either when they are put in

761
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:30,980
that position and we have to remember

762
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,929
and in Canada the program was started

763
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,640
not because legislature said yeah you

764
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,960
know we should legalize this product it

765
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,520
was because the court said it's a

766
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,200
fundamental right and freedom to use it

767
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,440
as a medicine and they pushed it to the

768
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,548
Legislature's to create a program and so

769
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,919
you know we've evolved since then

770
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:49,308
thankfully but you can understand why

771
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,720
the the 80 years of prohibition have

772
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:52,099
left us with a dearth of research now

773
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,929
there's a lot of research in the last 10

774
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:55,639
or 20 years that is really starting to

775
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:58,400
ramp up and certainly the work of dr.

776
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,690
shulam predating that but if we don't

777
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,340
start looking at observational data

778
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,320
today we're gonna wait 10 years before

779
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:05,959
the doctors are happy with what's coming

780
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,730
out in the last 20 years in Canada and

781
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,298
and and North America there were

782
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,740
numerous studies done on cannabis but

783
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:15,410
96% of those were looking at the

784
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,759
negative effects of cannabis and this is

785
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,259
where it's changing now there's more

786
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,480
research being done looking at the

787
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:22,808
positive effects and that was really I

788
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,400
kind of turned and what the Medical

789
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:28,009
Association's look at our studies and so

790
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,780
that was really a challenge and one of

791
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:32,269
the roadblocks as well good point the

792
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:33,769
India but well you know these are all

793
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:37,668
great salient points for the medical

794
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:39,529
space just for the recs I'd in terms of

795
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:40,759
like mistakes or whatever you know I

796
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,490
think it's really important to look at

797
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:46,190
how quickly as a country we have done

798
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,410
this and it was it kind of had to be

799
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,029
done that way it had to be done so very

800
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,240
very quickly to make sure that it didn't

801
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:54,500
the path didn't deviate and so when you

802
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,279
do something like that you stand up this

803
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,769
industry that

804
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,440
or you know bring this industry into the

805
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,000
mainstream or into the light it's gonna

806
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,529
be there's gonna be lots of bumps and

807
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,529
bruises and and we're not gonna get it

808
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:08,359
right exactly we were joking like if the

809
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:10,609
we had stood up the right side of things

810
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,339
and everything went swimmingly well and

811
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:14,569
there was not a single problem I don't

812
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:17,449
know I would have assumed I was

813
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:19,129
unconscious in some sort of dream state

814
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,230
now there's no perfection I mean you're

815
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,060
still striving for that and one thing I

816
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,620
wanted to point out that Kari brought up

817
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:27,139
so Canadian Medical Association they did

818
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:28,819
come out and say that that they don't

819
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,440
actually want a medical system that they

820
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:32,029
wanted to get rid of it but I want to

821
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,380
put a little context to it and this is

822
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,119
an important lesson I think that Germany

823
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,530
can learn from I think what we did at

824
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,939
first so the government went to the

825
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:39,529
doctors to those Canadian Medical

826
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,120
Association they said we're gonna

827
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,559
consult with you on this program we're

828
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,689
thinking of having you do the medical

829
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,460
authorizations so they said great let's

830
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,840
have this conversation and apparently

831
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,100
the way I was told and speaking with

832
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,959
them is they said they woke up one day

833
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,009
and they were told that this is what's

834
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,809
happening and they said hey what

835
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,430
happened to all our consultation so

836
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:57,379
there's a lot of politics involved and

837
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,630
there's a lot of bitterness there and if

838
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,130
a lesson that could be learned is try

839
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,330
and involve the medical community right

840
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,070
from the start like we had to set up

841
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:05,899
this like alternative medical community

842
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:07,879
of selling directly to patients and

843
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,320
opening up separate clinics cuz because

844
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,370
doctors weren't prescribing so if

845
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,799
there's a lesson to be learned there

846
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:14,329
it's try and include the community and

847
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,099
try to work through the community rather

848
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,629
than try to avoid them because by

849
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:19,759
avoiding them you get other problems and

850
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,890
I remember going to conferences in 2013

851
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,809
when I started and our Minister of

852
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,250
Health Rona Ambrose she would say like

853
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,869
cannabis does not approve medicine

854
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,490
cannabis is not good for anything and

855
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:30,469
then I would be at a conference a

856
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,509
medical conference the next day amongst

857
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,620
like pharmaceutical companies and people

858
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:34,579
would walk might be like there and I

859
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:36,229
just hear you're not even a real

860
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:39,220
medicine what are you doing here I'm

861
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,930
like well I have a license to be here so

862
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,850
and that dad had the result as well that

863
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,830
all the Canadian pharmacies didn't get

864
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,719
on board right away that's is why we

865
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:50,299
have this vertical integration direct to

866
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,860
patient system now they're getting on

867
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:53,569
all right and full circle we do have

868
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:56,000
pharmacist on board the largest pharmacy

869
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:58,549
chain in Canada Shoppers Drug Mart is

870
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,410
also now on board so we expect a lot

871
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,180
more to come through and a key thing

872
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,410
that every year I come and it's a key

873
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,480
thing and I really want to touch on

874
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,620
again his education can't stress enough

875
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,390
everyone's so obsessed with like

876
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:09,469
marketing and promotion

877
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,850
that's not the right way to talk

878
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,470
cannabis doesn't need to be marketed it

879
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:14,689
doesn't need to be promoted it needs to

880
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,670
be educated on and I just started doing

881
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,620
I just did my first non-medical

882
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,390
education last week because now we have

883
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,489
retail stores and there's so many

884
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,840
similarities between recreational and

885
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,980
medical I think from an outside you

886
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,449
think there's a lot of differences but

887
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,099
still people are trying to find an

888
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,930
effective outcome they want to spend

889
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:31,250
money they're looking to instead of pain

890
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,950
and sleep management they're looking to

891
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,630
go to a concert or go to a movie or you

892
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,009
know something after a date whether it

893
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,620
goes good or bad maybe a different type

894
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:40,879
of variety to use but at the end of the

895
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:41,869
day there's a lot of similarities and I

896
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,430
think that's important and if we can

897
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:44,629
just quickly touch on education because

898
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,549
it's not I can't stress enough how

899
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,410
important that is it's helped us so much

900
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:48,740
when we figure it out and everyone here

901
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,380
I know

902
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,089
knows the value of education maybe if we

903
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,100
can start at the end with Andrew and and

904
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:56,329
what your thoughts are on education

905
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:58,909
he'll maybe have some advice and how

906
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:00,409
Germany can do it yeah I mean I can't

907
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,810
tell you how much we've learned just

908
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,279
watching the data grow that we've been

909
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:07,069
capturing over the last three years it's

910
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,960
it's you know things like how many

911
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:11,539
sativa is actually are high in Mersin

912
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,940
and cause drowsiness so you know sativa

913
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:16,250
indica doesn't mean anything right so we

914
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,539
hear that and we and yet people are

915
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,250
still talking in terms of sativa and

916
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,569
indica so we have to teach that there's

917
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,430
more than just the physical appearance

918
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:25,159
of the plant we have to teach that

919
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,769
there's more than just THC and CBD like

920
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,029
there's up to 450 chemical constituents

921
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:30,619
in every single plan and it's different

922
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:32,000
every time you grow it and every batch

923
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,029
is even if it's grown in the same

924
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,740
facility by the same people so there's a

925
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:38,930
lot that we have to understand in terms

926
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,509
chemical constituents there's a lot we

927
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:45,049
have to understand about personals and

928
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:47,329
anybody's endocannabinoid system which

929
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:49,639
is determined by genetics and them know

930
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:52,399
many other factors we have to understand

931
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,710
dosing much better you know we're going

932
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,350
to continue to learn as we go and and

933
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,120
you know a lot of Len Bias plug it's all

934
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:01,639
about data do do you feel like we need

935
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,000
to also be mindful that like the average

936
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,200
consumer isn't like a super science

937
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,940
person that's gonna be able to like

938
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,090
understand all that like to package it

939
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:14,000
in a more like digestible format yeah so

940
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:15,109
I you know I think you know what we do

941
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,369
is help to arm the people who are

942
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,199
creating the curriculums like you guys

943
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:21,149
and put them into the in the hands of

944
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,120
the patients and the doctors but

945
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,740
there's enough data out there now to

946
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,739
create curriculums that will be very

947
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,450
beneficial to doctors and patients so

948
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,920
it's up to you guys you know who or all

949
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,930
have that great education we're on that

950
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,360
background oh that was one of the

951
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,920
biggest issues when we started as again

952
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,299
we started when we started eleven years

953
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,700
ago there was very little information

954
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:43,200
out there and education was paramount

955
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,549
for our patients

956
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,259
there was a program they didn't know

957
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:48,029
anything about it people looked at

958
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:49,379
cannabis from a recreational point of

959
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:51,210
view of people getting stoned you'll

960
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,760
teach in cheong sort of scenario and

961
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:56,370
when we started to do the medical side

962
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,769
of it we were didn't have a lot of

963
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:01,739
education we really had to take that

964
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:03,359
from some of the original pioneers who

965
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,099
were working with patients through

966
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,539
compassion clubs so we really had to get

967
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,398
some knowledge from there get our

968
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,929
doctors on board start to train other

969
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:11,489
doctors but that was a real issue

970
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,450
because we didn't have the ammunition at

971
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,908
that point and it was really difficult

972
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,888
in many cases to get it to pass along to

973
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,510
the patient's but when a patient comes

974
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,849
to talk to us they have many many

975
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,830
questions and you can't just learn it

976
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,628
from reading they want to have a direct

977
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:26,730
conversation with their physician and

978
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:28,849
again we do training for pharmacists

979
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,898
which again we started several years ago

980
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:33,148
interesting enough when this program

981
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:37,039
came into effect in Canada originally

982
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:39,148
they had invited the pharmacy and

983
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,009
organizations to be part and parcel it

984
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:43,648
they declined to be part of the

985
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,480
organization at that point and it's very

986
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,679
interesting now that after all this time

987
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,590
has come through we're probably talking

988
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,269
Oh 15 years ago when that program came

989
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,190
about now they're coming back on board

990
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:54,659
make you see the benefits of it but in

991
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,398
the earlier stages if they would have

992
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,380
been included I think we might have seen

993
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,420
a lot different program than we do now

994
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,099
because this is where people are going

995
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,440
back to even when they talk to their

996
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,929
doctors they still have many questions

997
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,190
for their pharmacists and in many cases

998
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:09,929
they feel more comfortable talking to

999
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,789
the pharmacist than even their doctor

1000
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:13,500
given some of the things that happen in

1001
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:15,449
the past which helped us create this

1002
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,369
program where people were getting kicked

1003
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:20,339
out of their doctors offices for even

1004
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:22,019
asking to be prescribed cannabis and has

1005
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,519
changed dramatically since that time

1006
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,259
that's right that's how it started for

1007
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,670
sure people can't believe that someone

1008
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,080
would be threatened to be kicked out if

1009
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,240
they say I if I find out you're using

1010
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,039
cannabis you're I won't even see you

1011
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,779
anymore as a doctor that's people just

1012
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,619
cannot understand that that's all what's

1013
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,240
going on hold

1014
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,159
that never happens here Steve some

1015
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,750
thoughts oh my my orthopedic surgeon

1016
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,219
actually said the exact same thing and

1017
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,530
he is now something that is referring

1018
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:45,029
patients to hello cannabis and that

1019
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,160
transition happened over the course of

1020
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:52,260
seven years so it does require quite a

1021
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:54,599
lot of patience nope Wow all kinds of

1022
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,000
patience so with respect to education

1023
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,529
truly one of our mandates is of course

1024
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,940
trying to relieve all of this

1025
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,560
misinformation that's out there and

1026
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,320
Andrew touched on one of my favorite

1027
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:07,380
ones which is when you go into many of

1028
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,539
the so-called great gray area which in

1029
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,910
my opinion and the laws opinions is

1030
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:13,230
essentially a black market area they

1031
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,819
have this common statement like Oh

1032
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,349
sativa is something that's more cerebral

1033
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,140
that you want to smoke during the day

1034
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:20,759
and an indica is something that is more

1035
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:23,369
sedative and they want to smoke that at

1036
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,230
night and the reality is is that I

1037
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:26,969
they're a sativa is available that have

1038
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,590
the polar opposite effect of what

1039
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:30,989
they're what they're saying and we now

1040
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,820
have the data that's able to do this so

1041
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:34,619
our original goal was to be able to

1042
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,360
actually educate the physician so that

1043
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,679
way they were more comfortable when you

1044
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,940
go to see a doctor and they say take

1045
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,940
three of these pills every four hours

1046
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,309
you don't question it I think 99% of

1047
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,929
people just do it and physicians weren't

1048
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:48,090
comfortable doing that at first so that

1049
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:49,829
was what Terri was able to pave the way

1050
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,809
for many other people like myself to

1051
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:54,239
follow in I was fortunate enough as a

1052
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:56,400
previous role and I as an investment

1053
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,839
banker I knew a lot of physicians and I

1054
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,730
suffered a tragic injury that uh

1055
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,910
unfortunately rendered me as an opioid

1056
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,740
addict I quit two months into a lifelong

1057
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:07,589
prescription and I use medical cannabis

1058
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:09,419
to do that so they saw firsthand how it

1059
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,220
worked for me but this was completely

1060
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,840
anecdotal we now have data and

1061
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,659
thankfully because of because of Andrew

1062
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,710
as well where we have all joined forces

1063
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:18,869
combining data combined with the

1064
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,630
pioneers combining with people that have

1065
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,849
a very interesting and powerful origin

1066
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,130
story and connections with physicians -

1067
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:28,769
all combined forces in one giant circle

1068
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:31,170
allowing ecommerce to step in to be able

1069
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:33,869
to increase access and this is a very

1070
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,610
large group effort where I truly believe

1071
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:37,829
that the education needs to start with

1072
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,809
physicians and once the physicians are

1073
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:41,549
converted they will bring their patients

1074
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:43,799
and and then everybody else will follow

1075
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,000
if you are able to educate physicians I

1076
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,190
think you will be able to streamline

1077
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,420
this process and be able to relieve a

1078
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,829
lot of the headaches that

1079
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,180
we faced here right and and you know

1080
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:53,250
what that's a hopefully something that

1081
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:55,559
people here are taking back with them is

1082
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,940
that it it does feel very competitive

1083
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,349
but it's important that you collaborate

1084
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,909
together you're trying to build an

1085
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:01,739
industry together and sometimes it feels

1086
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:03,269
a little weird that you think you're

1087
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:04,829
giving away your secrets there's very

1088
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:06,659
few secrets in this industry and at the

1089
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:08,159
beginning are also worried about oh

1090
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,539
they're gonna learn what I want to do

1091
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,339
what you want to do is pretty much the

1092
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,320
same thing everybody wants to do so the

1093
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,269
faster you realize that you have more in

1094
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,230
common start working together create an

1095
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:18,690
industry and then you can worry about

1096
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,530
competing now I want to just do before

1097
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,750
there's I feel like there's some

1098
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,960
questions here will you just do super

1099
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,400
quick rapid-fire the future innovations

1100
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,050
and technologies are excited but I know

1101
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,210
there's two innovations and technologies

1102
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,190
up here besides yourselves what other

1103
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,019
innovations and technology are excited

1104
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,159
about the future just quick bullets and

1105
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,259
then we're gonna go to the audience for

1106
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:38,789
some questions yeah I mean not to

1107
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,720
continue to say this but anything that

1108
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:43,619
that exactly allows these patients and

1109
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,750
recreational consumers understand the

1110
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,299
product better we have to get to the

1111
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,130
level of where like alcohol and tea is

1112
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,920
right now where you like you know the

1113
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,390
the the the type and the amount that

1114
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,579
works for you we need to get to that

1115
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:59,009
level both from a medicinal standpoint

1116
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:01,590
and from a rec standpoint but also in

1117
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,630
general just innovation in the product

1118
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:07,260
someone was mentioning from the audience

1119
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:09,960
in the last panel about you know oils

1120
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,630
and vape pens and edibles and and nano

1121
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,860
emulsified beverages I think that's what

1122
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,079
really excites me I think very quickly

1123
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,620
those types of products you like are

1124
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,000
going to eclipse flower

1125
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:23,159
yeah and and you know especially

1126
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,760
especially beverages we are socialized

1127
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:28,679
to drink and be merry with our friends

1128
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,230
and once you can do that in a way that

1129
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:35,190
you know isn't so calorically

1130
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:37,380
overwhelming you can you know you some

1131
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,690
really cool stuff happens so Steve quick

1132
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,300
with respect to innovations I'm very

1133
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:44,220
much looking forward to regulated

1134
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,440
standardized forms of different product

1135
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:49,409
delivery systems we're starting to look

1136
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,619
look at a nasal inhaler topicals that

1137
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:55,710
actually penetrate through the epidermis

1138
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:58,159
even receiving things with with elderly

1139
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:00,449
patients and pediatric patients where

1140
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,828
suppositories that bypass the liver are

1141
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:03,929
being used and there are many diff

1142
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:05,548
ways to administer this product and when

1143
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:06,989
we look at the medical delivery systems

1144
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:08,309
I think the innovative products that are

1145
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,869
there are going to be able to help a lot

1146
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:11,548
of people and avoid a lot of pain and

1147
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:13,318
suffering that unfortunately has

1148
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:16,318
ironically been induced by the

1149
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:18,358
pharmaceutical industry that is using in

1150
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,579
my opinion and I believe many others far

1151
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,920
more harmful substances administers and

1152
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,749
far more painful in that opiate ways and

1153
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,338
suppositories although very popular in

1154
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:28,978
hospice and palliative care not popular

1155
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:30,659
parties so it's it's not happening at

1156
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:37,679
the regulation or maybe not the parties

1157
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:42,558
you go to right now I will mention that

1158
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,558
club but anyways Terry okay I won't

1159
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:48,659
quick innovation so you know some of the

1160
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:50,389
innovations we're gonna see here you

1161
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,889
know very simply you're gonna see a

1162
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:54,868
separation of the medical market and the

1163
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:57,179
recreational market the way the products

1164
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,349
are marketed and way they're developed

1165
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:00,719
are gonna be different you see the pills

1166
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:03,709
the patches the suppository is on the

1167
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,749
medical side and you'll see a lack of

1168
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:08,399
connection to specific strains whereas

1169
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:09,929
when we see them the recreational market

1170
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,639
and we see it going ahead they're gonna

1171
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:13,259
continue to work within the culture

1172
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,538
talking about different strains that are

1173
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:16,679
popular and more of the experience

1174
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,680
you're gonna have and that's what we're

1175
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:21,208
seeing now is is people looking and and

1176
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,889
marketing towards experience is you're

1177
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:24,358
gonna take this joint you're gonna go

1178
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,858
enjoy a movie you're gonna do this

1179
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,139
you're gonna enjoy that so I think

1180
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,880
that's the area we're gonna see as we

1181
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:31,379
push forward for rec and then Medical is

1182
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,479
gonna fall right into the typical

1183
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,849
medical products that you're used to

1184
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:36,958
seeing on the shelves and I understand

1185
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,789
you know in Europe you've already had

1186
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:41,759
CBD here for a while that's gonna start

1187
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:43,920
to happen in the in the TC side of

1188
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:45,599
things where you'll have specific

1189
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,278
products and then the names and the

1190
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,019
culture will roll through on the

1191
00:41:47,278 --> 00:41:50,400
recreational good one Andrew and then

1192
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:52,348
we're gonna take a few questions

1193
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,389
so I think exactly right we're gonna

1194
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:56,430
start to see real true personalized

1195
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:58,949
medicine so we're gonna see formulated

1196
00:41:56,429 --> 00:42:00,419
full-spectrum products that will be in

1197
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:03,298
whatever route of administration or

1198
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,269
whatever recreational form and that will

1199
00:42:03,298 --> 00:42:07,978
be true personalized forms okay cool and

1200
00:42:06,268 --> 00:42:10,978
just a quick one to add different

1201
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:12,899
cannabinoids and terpenoids seeing a lot

1202
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:14,788
of devices like a vape and I've just

1203
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,660
maybe terpenes there's a guy you should

1204
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:16,799
go visit him over there

1205
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:19,170
has it and there's all kinds of

1206
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:20,548
different future technologies relating

1207
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,740
to which cannabinoids and chirping will

1208
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:23,519
do different things in research

1209
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:25,318
questions from the audience all right

1210
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,150
yes let's hear for the panel one time I

1211
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:29,369
think we have time for one here maybe

1212
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:32,190
two questions here we go all the things

1213
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:34,349
to two questions hi guys it's sunny so

1214
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:37,108
kana new frontier data I was just

1215
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:40,230
wondering what is the physician patient

1216
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:42,239
privacy model in Canada as regards

1217
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:46,740
sharing you know the experience of a

1218
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:48,298
patient tough one yeah I mean it's as

1219
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:50,759
you would expect the highest level of

1220
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:51,838
privacy regulation around so anything

1221
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,720
that has to do with the medical record

1222
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,250
has to be dealt with in absolute privacy

1223
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,699
I don't know how else to answer it it's

1224
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:01,530
it's about any other market it's it's

1225
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:03,449
higher than we call it military-grade

1226
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,010
yeah and and there's a challenge right

1227
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:06,899
now where a lot of people are collecting

1228
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,760
data and if you don't have the patient's

1229
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,108
authority to do the data like in a

1230
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,670
stream print they get the data from the

1231
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:13,348
patient but some other people they

1232
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,940
collect the data from the EMR and from

1233
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:16,769
the doctors but the patient never

1234
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,240
actually gave them access so there's

1235
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,568
some interesting technology with using

1236
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:20,909
AI

1237
00:43:18,568 --> 00:43:22,199
to answer questions and do that where no

1238
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:23,909
one's actually collecting data it's all

1239
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,288
very anonymous so that could be

1240
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:26,608
something very interesting but we have

1241
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:29,480
very high regulations and if you want to

1242
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:31,920
quickly touch on it and yeah for Shopify

1243
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,690
we you know we actually stood up a

1244
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,400
Canadian hosted version of our product

1245
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:37,318
there's actually really cool blog post

1246
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,829
at our production engineering team put

1247
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:43,739
out you can go check out but we also

1248
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:46,650
plug into some of the major compliance

1249
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:49,259
platforms in a completely anonymized way

1250
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,180
so we just sort of like get a success or

1251
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,559
failure a notification from whether or

1252
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:55,679
not they're a patient and then that's

1253
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,028
all the shop I even really sees from the

1254
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,519
like seed to sale or like prescription

1255
00:43:57,028 --> 00:44:01,559
patient management tool what room time

1256
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,880
for one more you got the last question

1257
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,789
for us thanks a lot for taking my

1258
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,619
question quick one several Canadian

1259
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:10,528
producers own and operate their own

1260
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:12,028
clinics and I'm just wondering what your

1261
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:15,510
thoughts are on therefore the potential

1262
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:18,838
conflict of interest well by law they're

1263
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,849
not supposed to they have done it they

1264
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:23,250
try and separate themselves it's a

1265
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:25,890
little it is a little conflict of

1266
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,889
interest in that if you own that clinic

1267
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:30,679
obviously you want to direct them to

1268
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:32,210
your clinic supply of products so as I

1269
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:34,759
said it by law they're not supposed to

1270
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,199
be doing that they found end arounds we

1271
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:38,748
feel that the patient should have a much

1272
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:40,308
wider variety and much wider choice that

1273
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:42,709
they have and through our clinics we

1274
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:45,589
work with all the with all the main LPS

1275
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,720
as well and any patient can choose the

1276
00:44:45,588 --> 00:44:49,190
location or the LP that he wants to go

1277
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:52,909
through and we help them with making

1278
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:54,798
those choices as well but the clinic LP

1279
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:56,298
owning a sone clinic you know is it's

1280
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:58,369
difficult for the patients sometimes to

1281
00:44:56,298 --> 00:45:00,199
get a wide variety it's a very common

1282
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:01,548
question we get I mean Guiness does

1283
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:02,899
Guinness on their own bar that's a

1284
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:04,909
common thing I get don't know Steve last

1285
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,160
les Comet and then we got to go any less

1286
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:08,659
comments absolutely absolutely clean

1287
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:10,788
objectivity especially if you're

1288
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:12,259
actually caring about a patient you need

1289
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:13,700
to be able to direct them to exactly

1290
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:15,710
what is in the best interest of the

1291
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:17,689
patient while maintaining compliance if

1292
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,039
you own an LP that clearly is a massive

1293
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:21,170
conflict of interest and we very much

1294
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,450
disagree with that model are you saying

1295
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,548
that to the u.s. experience where

1296
00:45:23,449 --> 00:45:27,348
they're all vertically integrated right

1297
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:29,088
so it's a different lens in Canada the

1298
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:31,278
lens in Canada is Public Safety the lens

1299
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:32,748
in the u.s. is commercial so when we're

1300
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:34,369
around for more questions if you have

1301
00:45:32,748 --> 00:45:35,988
any other questions and hopefully we'll

1302
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:38,509
back next year to talk more about the

1303
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:41,809
fantastic let's hear once again for the

1304
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:43,909
panel I'm sure you can accost them in

1305
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:47,619
the hallway and they will be happy to

1306
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:50,328
answer Terrell Smith or something or

1307
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:52,099
