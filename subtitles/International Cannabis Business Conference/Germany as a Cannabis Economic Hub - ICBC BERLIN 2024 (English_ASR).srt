1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,480
coming up next to discuss Germany as a

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:09,519
cannabis economic Hub the chief econ the

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,440
chief Economist for Whitney economics

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,289
I've said economics like four times now

5
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:19,969
let's hear it for Bo

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,969
[Applause]

7
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,399
Whitney well thank you very much um

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,439
really appreciate the the strong turnout

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:34,399
and it's great to be back at IC BC again

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,960
um I think I first spoke here in

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,079
2017 um I spoke on the second day I was

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,679
talking about why people consume

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,120
cannabis um and Dr um rapael mulam spoke

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,799
the first day and he was going through

15
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:52,358
all of his um medical research and it

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,399
was striking to me that the research

17
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,920
that he was doing the clinical trials

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,239
and showing uh the effects on the human

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,679
body um very early on and he's doing IAL

20
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,838
trials and the like it mirrored almost

21
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,840
identical to why people were choosing to

22
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:11,798
consume cannabis there was anxiety uh

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,040
pain management um you know um dietary

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,960
stuff and and so um it was quite an

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,159
honor to be on that stage um and it's

26
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,919
quite an honor to be back here today so

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,799
today I'm going to talk about the

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,680
economics of of cannabis and and what

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,520
the impact of the reform is in Germany

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,240
um I generally go through I I gave a

31
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,319
similar presentation yesterday at the

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,719
global investment Forum which I thought

33
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,959
was an amazing event very very

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,560
successful um and then but I generally

35
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,559
go through just a high level Global and

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,159
then I'll look at the US I'll talk about

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,840
Europe and then we'll dig into some

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,240
details on the German Market always when

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,280
I started to talk was like and so a

40
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,599
little bit about me I'm from Portland

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
Oregon um I've been in the Cannabis

42
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,438
industry looking at this from the oh

43
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,798
there we go from the economic

44
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,798
perspective I've been looking at

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
cannabis for about 10 years now what's

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,080
up um and my firm Whitney economics is a

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,159
global leader in cannabis and hemp um we

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,840
do business Consulting we provide data

49
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:16,680
to the industry economic research we

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,560
advise uh individuals businesses uh

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,439
governments um Regulators legislators

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,000
and the

53
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,318
like and so just at a high level

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,560
cannabis is really three Industries in

55
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,359
one there's the adult use the medical

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,759
and the industrial

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,920
and the industrial can be broken down

58
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:39,919
into um fiber and grain fiber used for

59
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,759
Plastics and automobile parts and like

60
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,000
uh grains for feed for animal and human

61
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,560
consumption and then the cannabinoid

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,158
sector um and uh um countries are

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,519
viewing cannabis as a tool for economic

64
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:55,318
development um they really see the

65
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,959
growth potential they see the

66
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:01,238
environmental impacts and they really

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,439
like it um and um can abis in general is

68
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,319
a trillion Doll Market and so it just

69
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,560
needs to be realized it needs to be

70
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:11,759
supported and nurtured um as it

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,799
transitions away um and into um you know

72
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,439
more environmental environmentally

73
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,080
friendly practices um it can help

74
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:23,158
transition away from the traditional um

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,760
Industries um let's see oh and one thing

76
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:30,239
to note is that a lot of countries are

77
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:33,158
waiting for the US to uh reform and when

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,039
the US reforms then um other countries

79
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,919
will choose to reform um but my

80
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:42,000
hypothesis now is that with so much

81
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,000
things so many things going on in Europe

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,799
in Germany and the like that maybe

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,639
European markets will take the mantle of

84
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,040
leadership in the Cannabis Reform

85
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,318
movement um and displace the US there's

86
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,639
just too much dysfunction in the US

87
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,158
market right

88
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,238
now so currently there's 115 countries

89
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,719
that have legal access to cannabis um

90
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,200
and they choose the reasons for legal

91
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,680
access for different reasons it could be

92
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,679
um environmental it could be um you know

93
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,639
economic it could be job creation and

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,160
the like um but nonetheless it's a

95
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,600
there's a lot of um reform and this

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,800
reform is accelerating um the there's

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,160
about a half a mill or half a billion

98
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,439
consumers on the high end uh globally of

99
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,280
cannabis

100
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:37,478
um it's it ranges from a 250 to 500 um M

101
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,038
billion dollar market and then you've

102
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:43,758
got another 500 billion to 750 billion

103
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:48,959
on the hemp total addressable market so

104
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:54,319
um this is a a global industry and it's

105
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:57,839
huge so um I I do modeling economic

106
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,439
modeling using different data sets and

107
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,918
the more conservative side is the orange

108
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:08,439
bar and that's data taken from the UN

109
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:10,639
ODC the um un um they do these surveys

110
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,918
every year well not every year but from

111
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,199
time to time in different countries on

112
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:18,198
cannabis consumption and like drug

113
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,000
consumption um and their usage rate

114
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,199
levels um for consumers are are very

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
very conservative and it's

116
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
understandable if a government official

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,160
says hi I'm from the UN do you smoke

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,600
weed then you know if you're in a place

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,880
like Singapore or something then

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,439
generally your answer is going to be no

121
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:41,360
um even if you do consume cannabis so um

122
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:44,680
the the UN ODC numbers are rather

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,759
conservative um the green bar is um some

124
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,478
data that models that I put together

125
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,199
that I leverage the UN numbers but um

126
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,560
then I um update them a little bit from

127
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,199
what I'm seeing in different markets and

128
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,038
I tap into all these different markets

129
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,960
all over the world and then there's the

130
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,800
high end which which is um a you know a

131
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,680
little bit more aggressive approach to

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,400
the Cannabis consumer consumption rates

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,199
um but what I found when I looked at all

134
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,439
these 115 countries is that the total

135
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,080
addressable Market that's illegal and

136
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,800
legal consumption um put together what I

137
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,240
found is that in countries that have

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,439
medical reform there's actually those

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,598
are the largest markets combined right

140
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,680
now and so there's a lot of Economic

141
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:32,279
Opportunity if you get into these

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,879
markets and then um get a foothold and

143
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,079
then as they transition into adult use

144
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,839
then you're already um in those markets

145
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,560
and so you can just expand your capacity

146
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,239
um so this is the the 237 billion is

147
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,478
based upon the conservative side so just

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,720
think of the upside potential on some of

149
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:53,879
these more aggressive

150
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,120
forecasts so in the US um people look at

151
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,439
the US a lot so I'd be remiss if I

152
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,319
didn't mention a little bit about it um

153
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:05,279
last year $ 28.8 billion um in legal

154
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,800
sales in the adult use in medical space

155
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,038
um we're forecasting 29 billion U for

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,960
this year so it's 10% year-over-year

157
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:18,000
growth um most Industries would love to

158
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:20,399
have 10% year-over-year growth um but um

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,839
in the Cannabis space because in the

160
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:27,359
early days they experience 18 20 30 35%

161
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,598
growth um you know 10% is um kind of a

162
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
disappointment um but when you look at

163
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:35,159
and peel back some of the layers of the

164
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,560
onion um 10 states there's is kind of a

165
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,879
different story uh 10 states actually uh

166
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,280
saw declines in their revenue I and

167
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,599
that's kind of surprising because you

168
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,959
still saw growth but the growth wasn't

169
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,279
coming from the mature States it was

170
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,038
coming from all the new States um and

171
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,559
then there's you know some regulatory

172
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:58,560
issues there's test inflation um it's

173
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:01,319
rather rampid um THC um test inflation

174
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,639
uh less than 20% of lenses in a recent

175
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,479
survey that we put out and published a

176
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,598
report on about a year ago um less than

177
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,598
20% of the lenses were actually

178
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,639
profitable and um so there's economic

179
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:18,680
stress in the in the US market right now

180
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:22,000
um $3.8 billion in delinquent payments

181
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,560
so um vendors aren't paying each other

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,959
and Retail isn't paying their

183
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,720
cultivators and the like and so um this

184
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,959
is a major issue um we just put out a

185
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,519
report on this as as well um and there's

186
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,038
this hyperfocus on by Regulators on the

187
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,440
hemp derive cannabinoids and and they're

188
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,519
trying to bring that under the marijuana

189
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,120
um

190
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,480
jurisdictions um but I'm not quite sure

191
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,679
if that's the right way to go um and

192
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,720
then you've got a nearly 80 billion

193
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:56,079
elicit market so even though um there's

194
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:59,519
a lot going on in the US market um it

195
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,200
could be regulated much better than it

196
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,200
actually is um and there's some federal

197
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,120
reform that's um on the discussion table

198
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,399
from safe access to interstate commerce

199
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,720
um legalization efforts um but it's

200
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
really fragmented and it's really

201
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,399
dysfunctional at the federal level so

202
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,799
I'm not anticipating very much Federal

203
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,440
reform to occur in near term and so it's

204
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,078
going to be kind of the status quo um

205
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,800
you know at least for the next few years

206
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,919
um and resched is being talked about in

207
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:37,000
the US um but I don't know if that's

208
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,159
going to be the Panacea or the it's

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,679
going to it's not going to be as

210
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,120
beneficial to all as people think and so

211
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,078
um there may be some unintended

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,480
consequences on that

213
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:50,519
reform now um despite the challenges you

214
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,440
know we're looking for strong growth in

215
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,519
the US um and this a lot of this growth

216
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,959
just comes from these new emerging

217
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,799
markets and some that have already

218
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,119
deployed their programs but are just

219
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,359
ramping up and there was a question in

220
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,278
the audience in the last panel that

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,600
talked about um the Social Clubs and and

222
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,320
how do you get a bigger Market in

223
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Germany and one of the panelists Riley

224
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,120
said that it takes more than just having

225
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,759
Social Clubs in order to expand the

226
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,360
market here in Germany and I totally

227
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:26,439
agree with that because um unless you

228
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,879
have access you don't have legal

229
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,200
participation and so the more access

230
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,958
that you can get to Consumers the more

231
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,920
opportunities there are for legal

232
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,958
participation and that's a big key I and

233
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,360
I'll go into that in a little

234
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:44,518
bit but you know by 2035 we're you know

235
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,278
we're looking at what $87 billion it's a

236
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,120
pretty decent Market it's taking a big

237
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,958
chunk out of the Elissa

238
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,839
Market but it's all because of

239
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:58,119
access so contrast that to the EU in the

240
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,519
US they look at hemp and cannabis

241
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,600
differently um um in the EU it's all

242
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
cannabis and I think that's refreshing

243
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,360
and then they just regulate it based

244
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,800
upon the product intention and so that's

245
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,360
reasonable and so people aren't tripping

246
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,000
over themselves trying to figure out

247
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,759
what's hemp and what's not um and um a

248
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,360
lot of the countries here in Europe are

249
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,799
defaulting to the EU rules and

250
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,759
regulations um and but this this German

251
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,078
roll out here is one of those indicators

252
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,720
that could be a catalyst

253
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,439
um to um have different reform and

254
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,759
accelerate the reform throughout

255
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,920
different European

256
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:43,679
countries um but um I think that uh the

257
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:46,879
EU could be you know a sleeping giant in

258
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:50,399
this Regard in terms of not only um

259
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,720
showing increases um in reform movements

260
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,120
within the EU but throughout the world

261
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,120
as

262
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,759
well and so in terms of numbers the

263
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,240
total addressable Market that's ilicit

264
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,639
and legal combined in Europe

265
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,879
conservatively using the UN data is $ 53

266
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,799
billion um but if you use a more

267
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:14,879
aggressive U modeling then it's $126

268
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,519
billion and um a lot of the countries

269
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,879
are looking at reform and they're doing

270
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,879
things kind of differently some want

271
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:24,439
pilot programs some want Social Clubs

272
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,000
some want other things and so um it's a

273
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,120
little bit

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,120
directionless um there's no one model

275
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,480
that's emerging quite yet

276
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,078
um but if you think about it for the

277
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,440
Eastern and Southern parts of Europe

278
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:40,599
they could become the providers of raw

279
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,040
materials and and um finished goods U

280
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,519
product manufactured goods and then they

281
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,919
can export them into the central part of

282
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,198
Europe and I think that's a viable model

283
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:54,039
because you have lowcost producers and

284
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:56,879
suppliers um in the periphery and then

285
00:12:54,039 --> 00:13:00,078
you have the the more um higher

286
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,439
generating income earners and consumers

287
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,120
in the central

288
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,720
part um but there's not much data on

289
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,000
this quite yet um we can help of course

290
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,000
I have to Shameless plug right um but um

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,278
there's the we're getting better in

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
terms of the data and the data offerings

293
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,399
and so but I'm always looking for data

294
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,879
and I'm always willing to share my data

295
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,120
so if you want to collaborate with me

296
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:31,078
I'm I'm wide open I'm happy to do

297
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,959
so so of that 50 3 billion just five

298
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,078
countries make up the bulk of the demand

299
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,319
um France and this is based upon

300
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,519
consumption rates um and then

301
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,278
multiplying the number of consumers by a

302
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:48,799
certain spend and so France is at the

303
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,399
top um and it toggles between France

304
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,519
Germany and Italy um but those are the

305
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,839
the big three markets and then the UK is

306
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,440
in there um I call them EU even though

307
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,800
probably shouldn't um

308
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,440
um but it could be if you if you include

309
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,039
some of the other periphery countries in

310
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,759
Europe like Russia and the like then

311
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:14,639
there could be um as many as 84 million

312
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,278
consumers in the

313
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,680
space so that's kind of the background

314
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,879
so I'm taking a little bit of a breath

315
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,519
uh let's go into some of the data about

316
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,679
Germany so there's roughly 4 million

317
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,639
consumers on the conservative side it

318
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,319
could be as many as 8 million consum

319
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,399
consumers um now in Germany in a recent

320
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,199
poll 47% of the Germans supported

321
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,480
legalization and 42% opposed it and so

322
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:46,278
that could be the reason why there's so

323
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,839
few relatively few consumers um when

324
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:52,600
compared to the US Canada Uruguay and

325
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,880
others um and in order to support all of

326
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,079
the demand um for uh cultivated or for

327
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,039
products regardless of the delivery

328
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:06,319
mechanism oils flowers and like um it

329
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:08,399
would take about 948 th000 kilos of

330
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,720
cultivated output in order to support

331
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:16,360
the entire Market um now this looks at

332
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,399
Europe in this chart um 7.8 million

333
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,680
kilos of total demand in the market um

334
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,198
17 million pounds um now for perspective

335
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,719
California produces 22 million pounds

336
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,278
every year even though um about 18

337
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,560
million pounds of that is exported

338
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:34,559
outside of the State of

339
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,680
California um and so the total

340
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:47,519
addressable Market total potential in

341
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:50,278
Germany is 7.8 billion EUR um and with

342
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,720
greater social acceptance and increased

343
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:56,799
usage rates um that could be as high as

344
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,560
15.6 billion EUR um now for perspective

345
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,479
at 7.8 billion that's roughly the size

346
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,278
of the Florida Market or the New York

347
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Market it's not quite as big as uh

348
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:10,000
California or Texas um but it is Florida

349
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,120
and New York and so those are sizable

350
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,278
markets Florida is ranked number two in

351
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,600
the US by the

352
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:21,838
way um in terms of consumers I mentioned

353
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,720
this 4 million as many as 8 million and

354
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,519
this is why this is the slide where I

355
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,800
mentioned the Social Clubs may actually

356
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,799
limit growth in the near term because if

357
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:35,838
you only have 500 um club members per

358
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,359
club and you don't deploy as many clubs

359
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,000
fast enough if there's obstacles then

360
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,519
you're not going to get that legal

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,839
growth legal participation that people

362
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,839
are

363
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:51,078
anticipating and so I mentioned the

364
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,078
total Supply um it could go um the upper

365
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:57,799
bound is around 2 million

366
00:16:53,078 --> 00:17:00,719
kilos um but this this total Supply um

367
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:03,198
isn't needed and so as regulations are

368
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,720
deployed um you need to kind of baby

369
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,399
step you need to grow into the you need

370
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,519
to grow the supply as the demand

371
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,120
dictates it and so a lot of the common

372
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:15,959
mistakes in these jurisdictions um in

373
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,719
these countries or States provinces is

374
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,759
that they tend to overs Supply the

375
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,360
market at first they issue all the

376
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,959
supply licenses and then all of a sudden

377
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,038
there's over Supply there's not enough

378
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,519
demand prices go down and cultivators

379
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:32,038
are left holding the bag they're not

380
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,639
making any money um and so the initial

381
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:38,038
Supply requirements in year one from

382
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,720
what I see is between 25 and 50,000

383
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:45,919
kilos now last year I think Germany

384
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:49,400
imported 30,000 kilos and I think

385
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:53,280
13 um 13,000 went to the

386
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,519
pharmacies so you know there's if

387
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,079
there's already a lot of supply and

388
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,599
you're going to add more in these

389
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:04,240
suppliers um domes ially then this is

390
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,879
really setting up for an over Supply

391
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,440
situation so in club openings I I

392
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,559
thought that it'd be interesting for

393
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,640
people to kind of understand my take on

394
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,558
the number of clubs and how they would

395
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:22,159
roll out over time so in the first year

396
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:24,119
we're looking at 200 to 400 clubs now um

397
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,919
you know the policy is one club for

398
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,319
every 6,000 residents but not all cities

399
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,360
are going to deploy not all cities are

400
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:34,839
going to have clubs um and it's going to

401
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:37,319
you know take time to ramp this up and

402
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:40,000
this is not uncommon in any new

403
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:43,480
jurisdiction where there's

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,159
legalization um it takes a while for the

405
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,720
for the um consumers to participate and

406
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:53,159
join into the legal um system and it

407
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,759
takes incentive so the government The

408
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,880
Regulators The Operators all need to

409
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:01,599
incentivize provide a reason for

410
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,400
consumers to participate legally but as

411
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:09,240
they eventually um do then there'll be

412
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,519
more and more um clubs required now um

413
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,000
you know I'm not this this model um has

414
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,279
some ranges here um we'll know more

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,919
about um and we'll be able to predict

416
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,119
this more precisely once we see the

417
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,520
first year results once we have an

418
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,678
anchor um in terms of the data for the

419
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,839
first year then it's very very

420
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,600
predictable afterwards um and so you

421
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,798
know I'll keep you up to date maybe next

422
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,879
year um at the same

423
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,279
conference um people like to talk about

424
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,679
employment especially policy makers

425
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,079
because when you're adding jobs when

426
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,880
you're adding tax revenue and the like

427
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,399
then that gives the politicians cover it

428
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
gives them protection against people

429
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,159
that are more in favor of prohibition

430
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,640
but when you're adding jobs then that's

431
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,960
a good thing um and so the total

432
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,480
potential Market um is worth roughly

433
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,558
367,000

434
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,880
workers um but you're only going to need

435
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:10,558
4 to 8,000 full-time equivalent workers

436
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,440
in the legal market now the way it's set

437
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:16,759
up in Germany is you have all of these

438
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,720
part-time workers in these clubs and so

439
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,400
you're only allowed to have a certain

440
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,400
number of hours or pay them a certain

441
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:29,038
wage per month um and so you know the 4

442
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,559
to 8,000 workers is really 12 to 24,00

443
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,879
workers um part-time workers so I just

444
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:37,319
combine them all into one now for

445
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,679
comparison we just published a report

446
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,599
with um um a company called vanst in the

447
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:47,240
US and it just came out the report came

448
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:51,279
out last week and um we show that there

449
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,759
were 440,000 legal workers in the United

450
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,279
States and so I just wanted to provide

451
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:58,798
some comparison um the total market for

452
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:02,480
employment in the United States is about

453
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:06,798
1.5 to 1.6 million workers so when you

454
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,720
think about this um 360,000

455
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,720
workers um that's a lot of employment

456
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,000
there's a lot of economic impact that

457
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,640
cannabis has in these countries in these

458
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,119
communities and this is why there's um

459
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,720
it's accelerating the reform um

460
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,959
throughout the

461
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,798
globe and so in terms of opportunities

462
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,120
there's some immediate opportunities and

463
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,119
then some long-term opportunities um in

464
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,158
the immediate term

465
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:37,839
cultivation um software to track all

466
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,159
this stuff crm's customer resource um

467
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,439
management

468
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:44,200
software um you know because you want to

469
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,159
track your club members and like um

470
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,440
medical research this is one of the um

471
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,919
significant benefits to the deployment

472
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,080
of legal cannabis um in Germany um and

473
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,440
medical research is desperately needed

474
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,839
more and more of it and then there's

475
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,320
other ancillary businesses so if you

476
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,879
walk out in the exhibit hall you've got

477
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:11,879
all these ancillary businesses from grow

478
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,840
lights to you know um cooler dehumid

479
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,120
dehumidifier easy for me to say and um

480
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,759
you've got all these ancillary

481
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:21,359
businesses and so there's going to be um

482
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,720
a surge and demand for these ancillary

483
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,479
services so if you get in early um you

484
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,440
can really set yourself up for success

485
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,519
in the future but there are risks right

486
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,480
it's not just you enterer into a market

487
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,960
and all of a sudden you're printing

488
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,599
money um you know there's risk of

489
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,880
oversupply there's risk and delays in

490
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:45,038
deployment um it may be tough to find a

491
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,159
location because of um you know certain

492
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:50,480
jurisdiction restrictions like um

493
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,440
permitting and codes and compliance and

494
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,240
all this other stuff so um it may be

495
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,880
difficult and then there may be other

496
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,880
barriers to entry that um you know that

497
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,760
go beyond the rules and regulations um

498
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,720
you know access to Capital and other

499
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:09,278
things so um it's important to

500
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,079
understand not only the opportunities

501
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,720
but the risks when you um when you enter

502
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,399
enter into this

503
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,720
space and so in terms of predictions

504
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,120
I've just got a couple more slides and

505
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,159
I'll take some questions if I have time

506
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:30,158
um but you know expect except expect an

507
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:33,360
acceleration of reform as a result of

508
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,360
Germany um and there's bound to be a

509
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,479
response from the EU and the UN um

510
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:42,399
because does it violate certain parts of

511
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,440
the international treaties does it not

512
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,440
um how does the one country if it's

513
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,120
legal in one country it's legal in all

514
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,558
in the EU policy how does that affect

515
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:55,399
now that um Germany has entered into

516
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,599
this space it's very compelling um and

517
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,120
then look for certain restrictions or

518
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:03,439
barriers um to get into these markets

519
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:06,599
like requirement for certified seeds or

520
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,840
GMP and GAP EU GMP

521
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:12,879
certifications um those are good things

522
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:16,240
because they um um enable the companies

523
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,760
to track and Trace um uh they do more

524
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,720
discipline in their operations and so um

525
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,319
and this also is something that North

526
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,200
and South American and African suppliers

527
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,839
should be aware of is that if um that's

528
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,120
a barrier to entry to get into the

529
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:36,720
European space too so there's a trend

530
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:40,359
towards GMP and GAP certifications in

531
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,558
South America um less so in the US but

532
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:45,359
definitely in Canada so this will

533
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,319
differentiate who can participate and

534
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,278
who cannot so it's really important to

535
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,599
be aware of that and prepare for it in

536
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,119
the future because it takes a little bit

537
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:56,278
of time in order to get those

538
00:24:53,119 --> 00:25:00,319
certifications um and then you know I'm

539
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:01,759
also mentioning um in addition to Pharma

540
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,918
being more of a Pharma play and a

541
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,278
medical play here in Europe um but you

542
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,038
know hemp will also become a major

543
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,960
Market in the EU they already are um and

544
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,119
they have the possibility of expanding

545
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,399
if they have enough land and cultivation

546
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,798
in order to

547
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:21,119
support and so

548
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,398
recommendations um communicate talk to

549
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,359
one another go to conferences like this

550
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,918
um it's really critical to do that

551
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,798
networking um and then get established

552
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,038
in j Germany or in Europe but in Germany

553
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,319
initially um so that as the Market opens

554
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:39,398
up you already have a presence here so

555
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:42,359
if you're a us uh supplier

556
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:44,439
manufacturer um it's important to

557
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:48,678
partner up with folks in this

558
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,720
market um and know your cost structure

559
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:54,038
um the reason I've harped on I've

560
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,759
mentioned oversupply a lot is it could

561
00:25:54,038 --> 00:26:00,558
lead to a deceleration in price and it

562
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,960
decline price and if there's a decline

563
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,119
in price then it could put people out of

564
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,798
business if they're not aware of what

565
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,798
their cost structure is all about um and

566
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:13,839
be prepared for that and it's important

567
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,639
to also use data right to understand

568
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:20,038
what the data is um talk to me talk to

569
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,320
anybody that has data um and make sure

570
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,558
that you use datadriven uh decision

571
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:28,359
making because um cannabis can be very

572
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,678
emotional at times and while you know

573
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,319
know cannabis is very

574
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,440
local um it's important to be aware of

575
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:38,079
the global Marketplace and so when you

576
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,159
act local that's good because you have

577
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,240
to but be sure to think globally um

578
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,399
because this is definitely a trillion

579
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,278
dollar Global

580
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:50,439
Market so um that's what I've got so far

581
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,440
um thanks for your attention really

582
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,558
appreciate it if you have want to copy

583
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,919
of my slides happy to provide them just

584
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,798
shoot me a note um and so we're ready

585
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,600
for we're ready for some questions let's

586
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:02,720
hear it for Bo

587
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,599
[Applause]

588
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,278
Whitney we have three minutes three

589
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,119
minutes so that's like one or two

590
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,640
questions but apparently you have

591
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:16,038
educated them fully and they are all

592
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,399
experts okay Derek here we

593
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:19,798
go just the one question about the hemp

594
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:21,359
where you say that you think it' be a

595
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,240
big Market in the EU as well my

596
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,000
impression is that in the states it's

597
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,640
not going that well with the hemp

598
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,679
industry so could you expand a bit on

599
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,080
that in 2 and 1/2 minutes oh hey if you

600
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,880
can bring up my slides um just for a

601
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,720
second I've got some in backup that I

602
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,278
can I can show and demonstrate the

603
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,200
market for

604
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:47,919
hemp so with oh thank you

605
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,679
okay so in the backup of my slides I

606
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,200
talk a little bit about the modern uses

607
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,880
of hemp but then I also looked at these

608
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,679
various Industries so with the hemp you

609
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,200
can make um construction material

610
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,679
automobile parts textiles you can make

611
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,120
EV batteries for cars um you can make

612
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,559
Cutlery um like my sister company

613
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,918
everyday hemp um company does um you can

614
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:18,798
feed this to animals and the like and so

615
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,759
even with just a small percentage of

616
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,918
market share capture by

617
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,079
hemp it's a half a trillion dollar

618
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,240
market um and so you've got these

619
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,960
traditional Industries and then then

620
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,399
you've got these industries that you can

621
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,440
support and um transition over to a more

622
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,359
environmentally and sustainable product

623
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,440
and so um this is what I'm talking about

624
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:45,678
when I say that there's a major

625
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,200
opportunity in Europe um and um this is

626
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,159
already in existence it's just it needs

627
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,080
nurturing and growth um and so in

628
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:57,278
countries where they have favorable hemp

629
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:59,359
laws um you can look at what industries

630
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:02,119
that they're current have in their

631
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,439
country like Automotive for example um

632
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:07,359
and then you can start building products

633
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,720
to substitute for existing traditional

634
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:14,278
Industries um now 20% of

635
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,600
BMWs are made with hemp parts and so

636
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:18,200
already that's on their website and so

637
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:21,240
they already have this sustainable

638
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,399
mandate in the EU so this just like I

639
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,159
said needs to be expanded now when you

640
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:29,000
compare it to the Cannabis Market total

641
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,600
addressable Market 237 billion

642
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,398
you've got 500 billion for hemp

643
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:35,959
conservatively that's why I say that

644
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,518
there's these great opportunities that

645
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,120
just needs to if you have a good product

646
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,000
you have a vision and you follow through

647
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,918
with it um there's there's tremendous um

648
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,278
upside potential as well in this space

649
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,240
fantastic thank you we're up here uh

650
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,720
right way to ask a good question and get

651
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,839
a bonus slide way to go Derek one more

652
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,798
question up here um kind of picking

653
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:59,839
backing off of his um comment of how the

654
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,359
US hemp Market's not doing so well you

655
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,119
stated that it probably would not be

656
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,558
best for Regulators to bring hemp under

657
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,479
the Cannabis umbrella however wouldn't

658
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,599
that create an unnecessary competition

659
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,079
between the hemp and cannabis industry

660
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:15,119
such in US Florida's baned on hemp

661
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,839
derived products in your opinion what

662
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,558
would be a better

663
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,798
route um yeah that's a great question um

664
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,839
the what is going on in the United

665
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:28,398
States is that Regulators are not sure

666
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:30,439
what to do with hemp versus adult use of

667
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:34,439
medical they're trying to bring it all

668
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,278
Under One Roof um but they're focused on

669
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,159
the intoxicating

670
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:43,278
canono and so they're not really um uh

671
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,440
able or qualified enough to look at the

672
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,960
fiber Market or qualified enough to look

673
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,480
at the food market the animal feed the

674
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,759
human feed and so I think to in order to

675
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,440
solve this they need to look and

676
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:00,960
regulate at the product in ttention

677
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,440
level and not it's hemp or or marijuana

678
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,880
and so if you look at it at the product

679
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,840
intention level if you have intoxicating

680
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,120
cannabinoids sure that might be

681
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:14,079
appropriate to be regulated um under a a

682
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:16,439
medical or a marijuana regulator um but

683
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,319
certainly roof tiles have no business

684
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,679
being regulated by a marijuana you know

685
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,879
and so um but right now um there was an

686
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,639
over supply of hemp in the United States

687
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,919
um which led to a deceleration um a

688
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,479
depression in pricing and a lot of

689
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,159
people lost their um businesses as a

690
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,960
result they went out of business because

691
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:42,880
of the following prices a lot of people

692
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:45,960
exited and so now the um hemp Market in

693
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,278
the United States 30,000 Acres I'm not

694
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,120
sure what hectar that is but 30,000

695
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:53,038
Acres of licensed capacity um look for

696
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,918
that to actually grow that's actually

697
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,158
lower than it was five or six years ago

698
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,679
so there's tremendous opportunities even

699
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,519
in the United States um but it's just

700
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,440
going to take a little bit of investment

701
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,919
and a little bit of discipline and when

702
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,919
it comes to policymaking they need to be

703
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,960
much more precise in their rules and

704
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,720
regulations otherwise they could have

705
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,880
unintended consequences like in Florida

706
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,919
um that's a multi-billion dollar market

707
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,600
for hemp and it it's generates thousands

708
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,559
of jobs tens of thousands of jobs and so

709
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:28,638
if you um ban something without being

710
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,079
disciplined um then you're not going to

711
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:33,319
meet your objectives for um Public

712
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,480
Safety public policy objectives and

713
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,678
you're going to have all of this

714
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,399
displaced workers and other things so

715
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:39,040
fantastic Bo Whitney we're out of time

716
