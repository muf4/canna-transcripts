1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,359
so welcome everybody to the novel food

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,759
panel novel food is a regulation that is

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,279
specific to the european union still

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,280
across europe there are countries that

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,839
are not part of the european union like

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,839
the uk and switzerland those countries

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,439
carry a different regulatory framework

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,960
even though they're dealing with the

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,960
same ingredient

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
i'm happy to introduce to you three

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,479

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,960
experience with novel food and some

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,199
long-term prospects for europe

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,679
so let's start with dr marietta chesan

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,600
marietta works at farmerham since three

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,679
years her current position at farmerham

19

consumer products such as cosmetics food

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,159
supplements and medicinal products

24
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,320
and she's the responsible person author

25

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,558
authorization of novel food that were

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,000
successfully submitted to the ec and uk

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,558
fsa

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,640
then we have mr kaifri de nirman

30
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,560
kaifritri is a specialized lawyer for

31

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
kai puts his energy into

36
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,560
sustainably establishing a cannabis

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,719
industry as one of the most significant

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
industries of the future and kai is

39
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,759
working with different clients that are

40
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,199
in the process of the novel food

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,840
application

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,840
and then we have dr francis garland and

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
he's the founder and managing director

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
of cloud 9 in switzerland a life science

45
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,599
company

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
based focused on the development and

47
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,599
commercialization of pharmaceuticals and

48
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,239
nutraceuticals based on medicinal plants

49
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,719
particularly cannabis and his vast

50
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,319
experience in fast-moving consumer goods

51
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,798
tobacco fuel

52
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,239
future pharmaceuticals flavors and so on

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,720
so forth

54
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,959
so let's get started uh kai can you give

55
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,478
us maybe a quick overview on what novel

56
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,959
food is and what the process of the

57
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,759
applications are at the moment

58
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,879
yeah sure so last time i sat here at

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,318
icbc was april 2019

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,318
three months after the novel food

61
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,399
catalogue has changed and we predicted

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,799
at that time that strict law enforcement

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,120
measures will take place and guess what

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840
that took place until now

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,239
but

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,878
the whole story so

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,319
before january 2019

68
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,519
the novel food entry was that

69
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,919
cbd

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
is not a novel food unless

71
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,280
it doesn't exceed the natural contents

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,598
of the plant

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
so this was a very broad definition not

74
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,280
very precise

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,280
but the industry could live with that so

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,919
if you had a 2.5 5 cbd oil it would have

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,560
been marketable by that time

78
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,559
but then intense discussions between

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
several european member states it took

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,800
place

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
spain started that in august 2018 and

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,599
removed all cbd products from the

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
shelves

84
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,359
it went

85
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,839
on with austria in december

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,200
2018

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,439
saying that a

88
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,679
general decree issuing to the governors

89
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,239
of the municipalities

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,040
saying that they should um enforce the

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,878
novel food directive because all the cbd

92
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,560
oils were deemed as novel food and then

93
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,959
we had the

94
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,400
change in the catalogue in january 2019

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,640
addressing now all extracts of cannabis

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,840
all extracts of cannabis

97
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,399
and it doesn't matter which kind of

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,680
cannabinoid it can be cbd cbg cbn

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
so all these extracts of cannabis

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,640
from then on

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,239
novel food

102
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,479
and then we had in germany the

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,480
the the public announcement by the

104
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,199
federal protection by the federal office

105
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,919
of consumer protection um saying that

106
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,318
there is no constellation possible where

107
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,438
a product as food

108
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:02,958
is marketable when containing cbd

109
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:06,239
and that was the end of the cbd industry

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,680
we helped to know or we had known so far

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,840
to that point

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,519
and then i had the european industrial

113
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,560
hemp association decided in june 2019

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,478
to start a joint application procedure

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,720
ir by now has

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,039
over 300 members

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,400
taking part in this consortium in this

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,040
novel food joint application consortium

119
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,799
and every company can take part in this

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,400
consortium so

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,720
um the aim was to collect uh 3 million

122
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,679
3.5 million euros

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,759
for conducting several tax studies which

124
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,959
are necessary to get the approval by

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,879
efsa

126
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,120
for these

127
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,199
joint applications

128
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,280
for these joint applications

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,240
and

130
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,478
ir has achieved that so we are

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,240
one third of the way right now

132
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,918
um and um there are four applications

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,038
for for this novel food joint

134
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,918
application it's isolate it's a raw

135
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,918
product it's a gold extraction and it's

136
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,439
a raw product they are all

137
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,758
decarboxylated

138
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:18,800
but not the war one is not destilated

139
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
information you can see on ihr webpage

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
and

141
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,399
the

142
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,959
procedure started so the the top studies

143
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,959
are prepared and i are starting now in

144
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,839
the in the concrete phase

145
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,159
of really

146
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,638
doing the the talk studies starting with

147
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,960
animal later on in the later stage also

148
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,600
with human exposure

149
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,519
and uh yeah that's the that's the status

150
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,439
we have seen a couple of circumvention

151
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,319
strategies in the market

152
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,719
uh from labeling as cosmetic as aroma

153
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,038
extract as a roma product

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,199
but the next two years will be very

155
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,959
difficult for the companies to stay on

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,439
the market to keep their products on the

157
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,638
shelves um and

158
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,879
after that

159
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,038
the the the fully potential of the cbd

160
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,199
market will will unlock with the

161
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,759
with the with the uh

162
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,240
yeah approval by by efsa for noble food

163
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,080
and um

164
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
until then yeah let's let's see how it

165
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,478
works

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,478
okay thank you um francis you're a swiss

167
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,038
company but you're also looking at the

168
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,879
uk market can you maybe give us an a

169
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,240
quick update on what is happening in the

170
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,319
uk um actually i was calling

171
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
some friends of mine this morning to

172
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
find out and i was checking also the

173
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,679
website of the fsa to find out if there

174
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,000
was anything new there hasn't been

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,038
anything new since april 26th when they

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,519
published a document listing the

177
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,879
i think four different companies that

178
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,198
have had

179
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,399
their applications

180
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
validated

181
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,719
and i make the difference between

182
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,038
validated and authorized because to date

183
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,120
no products have been authorized by the

184
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,240
fsa in the uk

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,800
and we still seem to be quite far away

186
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,439
from that

187
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
of the products i think there are

188
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,918
there weren't that many actually most of

189
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,479
them were a synthetic cbd

190
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,560
and from the echoes that i get from the

191
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,399
uk market it's it's looking that

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,959
authorities are very more favorable

193
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,000
towards synthetic to to any broad

194
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,000
spectrum

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,839
extracts or anything distillates like

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,199
that

197
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,638
i also heard that uh in terms of process

198
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,639
and we were talking about it just before

199
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,840
normally the fsa they said they were

200
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,840
going to publish the list of companies

201
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,560
that have had their

202
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,399
applications validated

203
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,038
however that list hasn't changed since

204
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:49,598
april 26th so it seems to be um

205
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,959
in delay in terms of the publications

206
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:55,439
they're not the fsa are not

207
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,638
keeping to the process that they they

208
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,879
wanted to engage with and i think i can

209
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,038
understand that maybe there are some

210
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,400
legal implications as well

211
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,279
in terms of when the authority is

212
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,519
publishing a list of companies that also

213
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,679
has implications for business and

214
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,399
commerce right so

215
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240
um i can understand maybe the fsa are a

216
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,638
little bit hesitant to continue down the

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,478
road and and naturally they're probably

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
in communication with the with the

219
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:28,159
people in brussels as well to try and

220
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,319
maybe harmonize actions so there's no

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,719
real news

222
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,360
from the uk side of things

223
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,120
now i'm a swiss company i make chocolate

224
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,000
i make swiss chocolate with a broad

225
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,599
spectrum extract and a cbd extract that

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,519
i can only sell in jurisdictions where

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,800
novel foods authorization is not

228
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,440
required so we're we're doing that

229
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,399
and i'm waiting actually for my

230
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,560
suppliers to get their authorizations so

231
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,799
then i can make my application from my

232
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,039
chocolate to the authorities and get on

233
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,599
the market so i'm at the end of the

234
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,639
value chain so i'm the customer of

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,440
people like margrethe here who

236
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,879
are really at the at the call face uh

237
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,959
tackling all the issues with the

238
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,480
authorities

239
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,399
thank you

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,560
you have submitted applications to both

241
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,039
authority authorities in the uk and the

242
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,958
european union um what is your

243
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,559
experience with that and are there many

244
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,879
differences and how the applications are

245
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,518
hello everybody yes that is correct we

246
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,278
have applied at farmer hemp to

247
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,839
different applications now food

248
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,720
applications to boat authorities it's

249
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,760
been over half a year now since that

250
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,839
and what regards the the approaches that

251
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,600
both authorities are taking

252
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
basically the rules that apply with

253
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,320
which are pla which do apply are the

254
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,120
same they both follow irregulation and

255
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,800
novel food they both follow eu guidances

256
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,799
for the novel food

257
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,799
however when it comes to the cbd

258
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,799
products there are slight differences

259
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,759
that we have observed

260
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,078
um

261
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,799
one of them is definitely the approach

262
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,039
that fsas of food standards agency in

263
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,359
the uk has taken

264
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:14,159
they basically left on the shelves the

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,639
cbd products that are at the moment

266
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,559
related to the novel food applications

267
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,199
that were submitted

268
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,439
before the end of march this year

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,759
this rule has slightly changed as you

270
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,200
probably know the first announcement of

271
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,958
the fsa was that the valid that the

272
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
novel food applications have to be

273
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,599
actually validated

274
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,360
in order to have the products legally on

275
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,879
the market this has changed in the

276
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,278
middle of march

277
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,039
i guess the authorities didn't cope with

278
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,519
the amount of applications that they

279
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,399
were receiving by that time

280
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,519
so they've changed it to just submit it

281
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,799
and as my colleague here says before

282
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,039
this is kind of related probably to the

283
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,000
to the fact that it's just too many

284
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,799
applications over there and um this is

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,399
one of the main changes i would say that

286
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,359
when we compare

287
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,440
ec

288
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,600
or efsa to the uk food standards agency

289
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,640
the next one is the public list that we

290
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,639
also already discussed this is something

291
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,879
that ec hasn't considered yet and

292
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,000
probably won't consider

293
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,759
but in the case of uk authorities try to

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,958
be more

295
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,278
market oriented to how to say and the

296
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,359
list indeed hasn't changed till now

297
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,838
there are five companies there

298
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,278
it's about 50 products that have passed

299
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
the validation

300
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,958
the public list contains also additional

301
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,838
lists with the on-hold applications

302
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,078
but also that part hasn't been updated

303
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,560
basically it's empty since the the

304
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,239
announcement of that public list so

305
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,319
it looks like

306
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,039
something is on hold

307
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,200
by by them not by by the applications

308
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,199
themselves um

309
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
another one which i found quite

310
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,480
interesting is the fact that

311
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,720
the rapid alert system for food and feed

312
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,039
which is a

313
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,079
rasff system in europe

314
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,879
if you check the notifications on that

315
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:18,958
portal you can see that unauthorized use

316
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,399
of cbd products is relatively often

317
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,638
on the list

318
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,799
so authorities in eu members are kind of

319
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,919
dealing with the cbd products on the

320
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,278
market

321
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,399
but i've been certain i've been

322
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:35,439
following also the fsa list or their

323
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,958
announcements and there hasn't been any

324
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,279
recall or any unauthorized use published

325
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,719
on there on their web page so this is

326
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,799
another

327
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
thing that we can say that that's

328
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,879
different in the case of uk this might

329
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,639
be again related to the fact that they

330
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,439
are putting everything on hold i think

331
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,278
because they are not really

332
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,279
i think they have a lot of other things

333
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,799
to do as well because of the brexit and

334
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,480
they are basically

335
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:05,278
quite busy at the moment so yeah

336
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,440
thank you um so

337
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,078
we see there's apparently there's a

338
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,440
delay as well as in the uk as well as in

339
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:16,239
european union kai what are the biggest

340
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,279
important factors that uh or that can

341
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,440
delay

342
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,919
the process when it comes to novel food

343
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
and do you know how many applications

344
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,000
have been handed in in total with the

345
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,200
fsa in the european uh commission and

346
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,720
what the current status is there

347
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,278
i don't know the exact number it's hard

348
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,120
to find the exact number it's about 50

349
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,039
probably

350
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
you ask about the delay that's a good

351
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,078
question i'm just a lawyer not a

352
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,560
scientist but

353
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,439
the the talk studies will be the crucial

354
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:48,159
part of this uh these this process and

355
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,480
it's the biggest stock study on thc

356
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,278
commissioned by iha which there has ever

357
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,000
been

358
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:57,120
so i assume that on the way on these

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,360
talks studies they will pop up problems

360
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
which no one expected and which have to

361
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,879
be solved then and which maybe can

362
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,919
delight the the the process um it's not

363
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:11,120
only about cbd this this this novel food

364
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,639
joint application it's also about thc uh

365
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,799
which is um

366
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,198
is just as important because we have

367
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,799
these strict thc thresholds for food

368
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,519
in the european union

369
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,879
the the so-called ar fd

370
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,759
by by efsa the acute reference doses and

371
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,399
these reference doses is so low

372
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,759
that you hardly can put a

373
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,958
product on the market um without

374
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,078
yeah having to fear to to to break these

375
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,518
threshold

376
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,559
and to have a call back by the

377
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,519
authorities etc and the aim of iha is to

378
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,838
increase this threshold by seven times

379
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,000
so that you have seven microgram per

380
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,440
kilogram body weight uh as a daily

381
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
intake

382
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,480
and then you can work with these

383
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,800
threshold and what pops up in this

384
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,959
process in these toxicological studies

385
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,679
uh maybe mageita knows about that as

386
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,439
well uh this we don't know that yet we

387
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,919
are all confident that

388
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,480
the the the they will be conducted

389
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,559
successfully and and on time

390
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,199
but you don't know what efsa comes up

391
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,719
with and no that's not sufficient please

392
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,399
do some more

393
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,639
add something on there we have another

394
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,240
problem do this do that we can't we

395
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,879
can't tell that right now but we are

396
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,159
confident that the process will be

397
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,919
finished within 2023.

398
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,078
thank you so much

399
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,799
what do you think are important factors

400
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,479
that will help to get a successful

401
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,399
approval and maybe you can tell us a

402
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,120
little bit what you've done for your

403
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,039
novel food application and what steps

404
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,078
you had to go through

405
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,319
yeah so

406
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,000
rule number one followed essa's

407
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,800
requirements i think this is the most

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,440
important important one uh with all the

409
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,439
notes that they put in the guidances um

410
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,240
they really want to know everything for

411
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,920
now we've been in communication with

412
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,680
both the fsa and efsa and they really if

413
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,838
they say you know preferably five

414
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,159
batches you need to do the analysis on

415
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,199
all five batches it's it's as that

416
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,480
simple

417
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,439
um

418
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,399
another thing yeah regarding our status

419
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,240
we have both applications in the

420
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,519
pre-validation

421
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,720
step and if so suitability check

422
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,198
um for the that one which is now in the

423
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,160
phase of if so suitability check we are

424
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,639
basically we are having a tc conference

425
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,278
with afsa authorities they will give us

426
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,839
some further clarification on their

427
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,519
requirements that have been submitted to

428
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
us in august

429
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,278
so i'm having this conference which is

430
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,000
part of asa supports supporting

431
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:53,198
initiative in september we'll see how it

432
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,078
goes but usually they are quite uh

433
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,639
they do respond to our questions they do

434
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,679
try to answer also our questions so it's

435
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,359
a constant communication with them

436
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:08,879
the same goes with fsa they do respond

437
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,318
thank you so francis let's say um

438
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,480
in the uk

439
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,798
novel food applications go through like

440
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,199
if any but will this do you think if it

441
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,679
will have any impact on the european

442
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,720
market if the if there are products

443
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,919
approved with a novel food in the uk i

444
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,400
don't have a crystal ball

445
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
but i would imagine absolutely yes

446
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
because

447
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,720
i mean they're the biggest trading

448
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,960
partners between the uk and the eu

449
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,480
anyways so there's going to have to be

450
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,558
some sort of a

451
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,960
harmonization there between the two

452
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,079
systems probably the fsa will come first

453
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,319
before the eu because the eu seem to be

454
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,759
i don't know on life support there

455
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,960
there's no nothing coming out of

456
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,798
brussels you say you have good

457
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,480
communication that's great but they

458
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,960
don't seem to be making much progress

459
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,240
right at the eu level and i mean last

460
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,240
year you remember they put all the

461
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,480
dossiers on hold the 50 years old

462
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,640
dossiers back in when was it march last

463
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,880
year because they had the preliminary

464
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,000
review remember the legal review from

465
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,919
the

466
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,119
digi-sante and they said that it was a

467
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,120
narcotic

468
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,558
remember that and then we had to wait

469
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,399
until november when uh it came out that

470
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,639
from the european court of justice that

471
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
okay it's not a narcotic and then what

472
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,679
two two or three days later the european

473
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,840
commission came out with their statement

474
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,240
saying okay all the dossiers are back

475
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,439
back in progress again but since

476
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,400
november

477
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,960
nothing

478
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
right so um if

479
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,519
if the uk

480
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,400
get ahead in the race to actually

481
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,759
develop this market in europe for sure

482
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,000
there's going to be a consequence going

483
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,798
to be an impact do you think we we

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,119
should be more pushing from the industry

485
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,798
side that we get some results and that

486
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,558
there is more progress do you think we

487
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:54,720
should push more

488
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:56,480
uh at the european level

489
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,000
general

490
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,720
i think that's being done by your

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,319
colleagues in i i have eiha they're

492
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,720
doing that and there's some other

493
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,960
associations very active in brussels and

494
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,798
companies also in private comp you know

495
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,038
canadians they have offices set up in

496
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,599
brussels and they're doing a lot of

497
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,919
lobbying uh in in the

498
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,519
in the brussels corridors so i think

499
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,799
that's happening

500
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,798
i don't know if anyone's listening

501
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,399
that's where i have most of my doubts

502
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,400
yeah and then you know i think the uk

503
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,759
their authorities fsa like i think they

504
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,600
received something over 800 applications

505
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,440
a lot of them didn't even get past the

506
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,719
rf number when they registered you know

507
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
when you register online your

508
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
application you get an rf number and

509
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,919
then you go to the next step but a lot

510
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,519
of the companies didn't get to the next

511
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,759
step because they didn't have their

512
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,639
applications done the right way like you

513
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,359
guys

514
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,038
so

515
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,759
um

516
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,038
i can't really say any more than that

517
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,759
thank you

518
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,759
so

519
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,319
let's jump a little bit to another topic

520
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,480
but that goes to the same authority um

521
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,960
let's talk about health claims and false

522
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,720
advertiser advertisement kai

523
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,120
what is the problem with this from a

524
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,079
legal perspective

525
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,678
yeah this is a the third obstacle of the

526
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,839
cbd business

527
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,679
the the first is a novel food the second

528
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,119
is thc and the third is health claims

529
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,960
so

530
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:25,038
i started to work in the industry 2017

531
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,159
and by that time i didn't know what cbd

532
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,599
is at all

533
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,440
and everyone asked me what is that

534
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,279
how is it legally how can you see that

535
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,919
and then the work started and we jumped

536
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,599
in as lawyers and to gather and to

537
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
collect the legal framework what's

538
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,359
what's going on

539
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
and

540
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,600
then you saw the boom the cbd boom

541
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,558
so

542
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,519
numbers skyrocketing the sales numbers

543
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,000
and

544
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,918
why is that because this product is so

545
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,400
popular so many people having so many

546
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,520
expectations for their life for their

547
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,280
well-being for their homeless studies

548
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,240
i don't really can't i can't explain it

549
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,720
to myself

550
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,079
today even today that is so so popular

551
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,079
uh by

552
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,480
but by by that

553
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,918
by that expectations you have that

554
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,919
at this product

555
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,799
it's just one step to have a health

556
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,240
claim

557
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,879
it's good for your homostasis is also a

558
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,558
borderline case and if you start it's

559
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,360
good for cancer it's

560
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:30,399
it's good for even covet 19 maybe

561
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,639
it's a clear health claim and by that

562
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,798
you need to have an authorization for

563
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,320
that product according to the medicines

564
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:40,960
act in in in the european union

565
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,918
so but then the marketing departments

566
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,759
from the companies coming and asking

567
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,840
what can we say we need to say something

568
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,079
our ceo

569
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,839
needs some bullet points and

570
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:57,119
then they set up on their web pages

571
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,119
like cbd

572
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,480

580
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,400
in the eye of the

581
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,199
authorities and they find these

582
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600

designate your product as a medicine and

587
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,360

588
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,359
problem of the of the whole business you

people love it but you can't tell why

591
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:45,038
and you set up a nice brand and nice

592
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,038
graphics and you have a nice

593
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,880
shop in in berlin or

594
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,640
what is it a flex store and everything

595
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,480
looked nice and the people coming in and

596
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,880
you can tell them what what this is

597
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,798
about this is a this is a problem and

598
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,679
will only uh

599
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,599
be solved if there might be a health

600
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,080
claim accepted

601
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,119
and um and

602
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,558
in the we

603
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,279
we will be

604
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,960
accepted by the eu commission and will

605
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,839
be listed in the u health claim

606
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,759
catalogue then might be one day this

607
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,798
problem will solve but it doesn't look

608
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,359
like like this right now

609
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,359
thank you so much how are you dealing

610
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,279
with functional and health claims and

611
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,279
what is your opinion on the issue of

612
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,119
false claims

613
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,839
so i think this issue is a bit more

614
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,759
general it's not related only to the cbd

615
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,918
products it's basically related to all

616
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,119
consumer products that can be purchased

617
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,440
nowadays

618
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,239
the kind of new miracles that cure

619
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,640
cancer appear almost every day and i

620
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,640
think this is a common problem of false

621
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,880
claims for the whole industry not just

622
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,200
the cbd industry

623
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,679
um in the eu like it was mentioned

624
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,679
before we do have an established system

625
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,640
of nutritional claims the claims that

626
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,720
you know like low fat low sugar claims

627
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,720
which can be completely legally used for

628
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,798
certain products under certain

629
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,519
circumstances and the same goes with the

630
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,440
health claims there's a register

631
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,759
you register of

632
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,519
authorized health claims such as the

633
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,679
claims that are used typically for

634
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,759
vitamins for minerals

635
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,759
which can be illegally used so without

636
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,839
breaching any law

637
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,119
when it comes to the cbd it's true

638
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,038
there's no

639
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,678
authorized claim for the moment

640
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,919
available in the eu but we at pharma

641
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,000
hemp have decided to go a step further

642
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,759
and start with the project

643
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,759
another application for the

644
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,640
authorization of the health claim that

645
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,359
will be related or is related to the

646
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,200
certain condition

647
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,719
i'm personally involved i'm going to be

648
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,798
the author of this health claim

649
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,600
authorization dossier and i must say

650
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,679
that this is even more complex project

651
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,519
and even more demanding tasks than the

652
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,559
novel foods to be honest

653
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,200
um

654
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,720
partially this is related also to the

655
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,278
fact that the new transparency

656
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,159
regulation came into force this has

657
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:08,240
happened this march and i think that

658
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,039
the whole process because of that new

659
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,038
regulation is even more difficult and

660
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,278
even more complex but yeah we will try

661
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,119
to do it i'm working on this project now

662
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,759
for a few months

663
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,278
it is an interesting new thing a lot of

664
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,440
clinical data has to be reviewed but

665
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,720
we'll see how how fast will i be

666
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,640
hopefully we'll

667
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,880
submit the application by the end of

668
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,480
this year

669
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,159
and francis how are you dealing with

670
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,038
health claims

671
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,159
we don't make any health claims

672
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,919
simple we we comply with the law

673
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,720
and i mean when i started my journey

674
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,400
also back in 2017 at the same time the

675
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
first thing i did was i went and met

676
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,320
with my local authorities in switzerland

677
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,839
and i said what do i need to do to

678
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:56,879
comply with the law so they said things

679
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,959
like well it has to be a eu certified

680
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,240
hemp it has to be a traditional

681
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,840
extraction process can't contain any thc

682
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,440
because in switzerland we actually have

683
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,918
a regulation in the contaminants direct

684
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,880
ordinance for contaminants and food

685
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,320
products

686
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,840
uh specific levels unlike the eu i mean

687
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,278
we actually have a regulation in

688
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,278
switzerland uh for that and um

689
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,079
and basically it's it's

690
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,119
zero with a lot of decimal points okay

691
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,439
um

692
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,879
and um and no health claims that was the

693
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,320
final thing they said to me they said

694
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,559
you cannot make a health claim because

695
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,720
it's a food product falls under food law

696
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,678
so that's it simple

697
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,919
thank you

698
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
so um can i add one more thing though

699
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,520
sure because um

700
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,599
to follow on what margarita was saying

701
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,038
about the category of like vitamins

702
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,399
probiotics because that's a nice

703
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,519
category where

704
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,038
if you do get a product approved and we

705
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,798
are actually in the process of doing

706
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,839
that in canada at the moment for our

707
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,480
chocolate

708
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,000
not the cbd one but using hemp seed oil

709
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,599
so we're using the nutritional

710
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,159
properties of hemp seed oil as a

711
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,240
superfood to also get it approved as a

712
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
as a natural health product because in

713
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,960
in health canada they have that category

714
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,798
of nhps so then we can also sell our

715
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,720
chocolate in pharmacies or power

716
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,119
pharmacies or health food stores and

717
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,960
make health claims

718
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,558
that's very interesting

719
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,038
so um

720
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,720
maybe again to you francis um

721
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,200
maybe you are brave enough to look in

722
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,038
the glass bubble um so how long do you

723
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,278
estimate will it take to get the first

724
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,839
approval of cannabini cannabinoid

725
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,759
related novel food ingredients and how

726
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,480
long will it take to bring those uh

727
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,480
market products to the consumer and what

728
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,599
which products do you think will be most

729
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,038
likely

730
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,359
yes

731
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,440
authorized

732
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,038
we've been waiting two i know i i my

733
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,200
supplier has been waiting two i know a

734
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,038
year and a half years since they they

735
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,480
made their applications to the authority

736
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,240
they didn't wait till march to make that

737
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,278
they made them already a year before in

738
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,720
the uk still waiting uh same with the

739
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,720
european commission still waiting in

740
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,278
brussels so i don't know i mean i really

741
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,519
don't know i and i don't think anyone

742
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,278
knows yeah

743
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,200
wait do you think any products have a

744
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,640
better chance of getting faster approval

745
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,880
over others

746
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,278
yeah this is what we've discussed before

747
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,360
maybe the synthetic cbd is the most

748
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,679
prominent one however

749
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,158
also with what regards natural hem

750
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,000
derived products i think that

751
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,559
the isolated forms of cbd might be

752
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,278
a bit faster than than the full spectrum

753
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,119
or broad spectrum extracts but

754
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,519
again this really depends on the

755
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,239
application itself if it's

756
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,359
good quality application it might be

757
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,919
faster

758
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,639
and not rejected at the end

759
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,360
thank you so um another question kai

760
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,080
what do you think if there are approvals

761
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,158
of

762
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,000
novel food applications how will this

763
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,399
affect all the other companies who don't

764
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,038
have approval

765
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,798
yeah so we at i have we

766
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,558
are assuming that

767
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,918
by these talk studies which are

768
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,398
conducted now

769
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,240
we will get or this application will get

770
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,479
data protection

771
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,919
according to article 27 of the novel

772
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,960
food directive

773
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,360
so no other company can refer to the

774
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,798
results of these talk studies

775
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:22,240
only the licensees of iha of iha project

776
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:24,839
gmbh can refer to these results for a

777
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,278
period of five years

778
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,119
so uh

779
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,000
all members now who joined the

780
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,359
consortium have a have a clear market

781
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,558
advantage

782
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,079
in this time

783
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,480
this is for sure

784
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:41,038
and all the other companies which did it

785
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,480
on their own as well so probably you

786
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,640
have to have a lot of data and a lot of

787
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,599
stock studies and this data protection

788
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,038
will be granted we assume that very very

789
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:51,678
strongly

790
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:56,079
and all others companies which are not

791
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,798
licensed but don't have any any um

792
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,439
we are not affiliated or associated to

793
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,639
any of the licenses or of these noble

794
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,960
food

795
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,600
authorizations will have a problem

796
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,000
and not i only i have will

797
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,759
kick them out or we'll send them the

798
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,599
cease and desist letters

799
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,240
for stopping distribution

800
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:19,439
the authorities as well so

801
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,798
it's still time to join iha

802
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,360
it's maybe i can tell it's a

803
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:28,319
2 500 euros for the membership

804
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:31,119
as a minimum fee below 1 million

805
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,839
euro revenue and it increases the more

806
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,479
revenue you make it stops at over 20

807
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,439
million revenue per year it will be

808
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,880
actually 190 000 euros

809
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,880
you can pay that in three um

810
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,640
three parts

811
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,080
and um

812
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,200
yeah so

813
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,038
it's

814
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,880
nineteen thousand

815
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,440
and two thousand five hundred below one

816
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,440
revenue that's the starting point uh and

817
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,480
uh the fees will increase every half

818
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,440
year

819
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,599
and uh aya is still open for uh for new

820
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,000
members in this consortium

821
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:09,599
i can only strongly recommend to

822
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,880
to to to organize something like this

823
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,759
okay thank you

824
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,360
so

825
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,200
we're basically through with our

826
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,879
questions but this will leave us a

827
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,640
little bit more time for taking

828
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,799
questions from the audience

829
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,399
if there are any

830
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,359
that's fantastic let's hear it for lisa

831
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:25,359
in the panel so far

832
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,398
thank you to all the panelists also

833
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,319
so i've got a question actually this is

834
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,319
an issue that kai brought up and i think

835
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,599
maybe francis will be facing uh

836
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:40,319
obviously novel food is not just cbd

837
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,158
right it's anything it could be thc

838
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,439
what's going to happen in switzerland as

839
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,600
of next year how is food going in in you

840
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,159
know with thc going to be dealt with or

841
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,079
etc and what if how

842
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,159
if any way do you think that path is

843
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,798
going to be different

844
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,799
i'll start to answer that because i what

845
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,759
margarita is referring to

846
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:05,519
is since may the 15th in switzerland our

847
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,919
ministry of health has opened uh to

848
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,440
receiving applications

849
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,919
for a new swiss pilot program that has

850
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,919
been approved by the government after a

851
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,840
couple of years of going through the

852
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,840
legislative process to modify our

853
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,959
narcotics law

854
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:26,798
allowing for a study to take place

855
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,120
so it's a study a minimum five years

856
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:32,319
to evaluate um

857
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,639
and to collect data uh on whether we

858
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:37,278
want to legalize uh recreational

859
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,440
cannabis in the country so you know

860
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,960
switzerland loves to do referendums

861
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,480
we're always doing referendums every

862
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,399
three months practically

863
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,319
so probably in five years time there's

864
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,079
going to be a big referendum

865
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,398
the nice thing is that in order to

866
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,398
change just to modify the narcotics law

867
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,239
actually all a lot of the stakeholders

868
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:55,918
in switzerland

869
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,919
were favorable to it they they allowed

870
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,159
at the political parties and

871
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,240
representatives the the medical

872
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,080
community so it's it's interesting

873
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,000
because we realize that in switzerland

874
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,759
we have over 220 000 uh consumers of

875
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,919
illegal cannabis

876
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,759
in the country so it's not a drop in the

877
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,880
ocean anymore you know for a population

878
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,319
of 9 million so so there's a consensus

879
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,000
and you know this also falls in line

880
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,678
with switzerland's more progressive

881
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,038
attitude uh for many years um on

882
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,320
on

883
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:31,119
drug drug laws so um

884
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:34,158
the idea there marguerite is that

885
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:37,119
it'll be under uh the protocols of a

886
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,159
study so it's a scientific study so

887
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,599
that's how we are being allowed now to

888
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,278
uh put products into the market and and

889
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,678
the thing is the participants of the

890
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:51,200
products now will be recruited by the

891
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,399
study organizers 5 000 participants per

892
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,558
study in all the cantons we have 26

893
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,239
cantons so you can do the math and you

894
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,879
can see what the potential market will

895
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,679
be for this particular study

896
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,080
so under that under that framework of a

897
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,159
scientific study it's been approved it's

898
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:12,319
been allowed okay so from next year um

899
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,919
we'll be able to put into actually i'm

900
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,559
starting now actually because we have

901
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,918
our we have our application i got nice

902
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,918

903
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,279

the database and made available to all

906
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,519
the study organizers in the country so

907
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,560
we'll be able to do a nice swiss

908
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:37,269

912
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,398
any more questions

913
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,878
no one has questions

914
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,720
at all not even for like maybe the

915
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,759
recipe for the swiss chocolate with the

916
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,439
cbd how much thc should i put in it

917
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,760
we're allowed up to 20

918
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,679
up to twenty percent well let's start

919
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,040
let's start with that uh i don't know

920
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,519
i've become a lightweight now so like

921
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,759
five milligrams per serving so ten

922
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,759
little squares on our bar

923
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,680
five migs per little square you should

924
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,560
almost do like one big for little square

925
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,679
because who's going to eat half of a bar

926
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,759
yeah exactly you're going to eat the

927
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,559
whole bar maybe some food but might get

928
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,720
better

929
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,639
than your 83 more so yeah

930
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,480
you know that's how it goes no no

931
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,519
questions at all

932
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,599
closing statements

933
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,358
sure i wish everybody success who has

934
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,359
applied for novel food so

935
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,599

936
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,160
