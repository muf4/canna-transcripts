1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,278
you can hardly see police you know

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,919
embarrassing people for a joint so I

3
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:08,320
remember when you went to jail and there

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:11,638
was a movement here in Slovenia to free

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,879
B we cannabis scientists we know that

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,519
cannabis has no influence on the driving

7
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,600
when you are regular user I don't know

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,439
what your audience think about former

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,840
Yugoslavia but former Yugoslavia was not

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,518
the Eastern block I have an important

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,109

special in terms of the Cannabis

17
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:51,280

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,840
we do here in the

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,920
Balkans uh boo why don't you just tell

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,960
us a little bit about uh Slovenia just

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,359
describe in in your own

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,478
words uh how you feel about Slovenia how

33
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,640
would you would describe Slovenia to uh

34
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:35,879
someone else

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,719
else H Slovenia generally is a miniature

36
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:42,599
country but uh we have everything you

37
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,399
know we have a beautiful sea we have

38
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,679
mountains in Slovenia you can ski and

39
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,439
swim in two hours

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,560
difference uh we have still quite

41
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,718
healthy

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,879
environment but the only thing we don't

43
00:01:54,718 --> 00:02:00,118
have yet in Slovenia is can good

44
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,319
cannabis policy good cannabis policy but

45
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,280
uh when I'm walking around the streets

46
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,478
here in

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,959
lublana uh I see weed everywhere I I

48
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,080
actually get to smoke my joint uh with

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,360
impunity it seems the cops this I've

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,800
lived in a lot of different countries

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,800
and though the Cannabis policy here uh

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,760
needs to modernize for sure um they say

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
uh implementation is 90% of the law and

54
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,799
so when you're on the ground here and

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
you're and you're and you're smoking

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,160
weed and the you know some places you

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,680
feel the cops you feel this like this uh

58
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,799
we would call a police state right but

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,599
in Slovenia in ter uh uh in comparison

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,840
to all the other places I've lived on

61
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:45,439
the planet it does not feel so much like

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,840
a a police state can you speak to that

63
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,878
at all yes of course uh generally

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,640
speaking you know police uh regarding

65
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:57,439
cannabis is way

66
00:02:53,639 --> 00:03:00,518
more tolerant uh than our bureaucrats

67
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,439
because uh we achieved through l 15

68
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:08,400
years many ver verdict on the Supreme

69
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:11,000
Court and police is following it so uh

70
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,920
nowadays you cannot find almost any

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,360
police who will uh put charges on some

72
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,399
uh patient who is growing for himself

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,799
you can hardly see police uh you know

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,640
embarrassing people for a joint in

75
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,640
lublana you can openly smoke almost

76
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,639
everywhere uh so

77
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,719
in practice is way better than in theory

78
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,679
say I yeah no and I think everywhere uh

79
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,840
on the planet you see a disconnect with

80
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,080
where the people are at with where

81
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,158
versus where the politics are at but a

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,719
lot of times you'll find the police are

83
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,120
in line with the politics and so

84
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,199
there'll still be cracking skulls for

85
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,599
for for yeah not in Slovenia there are

86
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:01,158
some data that almost one3 of Slovenian

87
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:05,359
are using cannabis on regularly almost

88
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:09,399
oneir almost one3 and I think also many

89
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,159
police is uh in this onethird of the

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,158
population for me it seems very accepted

91
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,959
it seems that everybody when you bring

92
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:20,279
up like when I tell people what I do

93
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,040
here in Slovenia everybody's everybody's

94
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,799
interested and everybody's curious and

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,919
I've had nobody say or I felt I've never

96
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,879
felt I can hardly think of one one

97
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:36,439
example where someone like

98
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,360
uh recoiled had some visceral recoil

99
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,959
because I told them something that they

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,160
were just appalled by no it's actually

101
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:47,599
on the contrary exactly people are so

102
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,400
open in Slovenia so why do you think the

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,720
public is so because I've lived in other

104
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,879
European countries also and it's not

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,600
like it is in Slovenia I've lived in

106
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,279
Holland also and it's not as open that

107
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,879
in for General Society here it just

108
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,198
seems like people really just don't give

109
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,478
a [ __ ] they just know that it's cannabis

110
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,840
is a benign plant they just in general I

111
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:10,639
think people don't give a [ __ ] here and

112
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,599
what I mean by that is they they they

113
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,879
think you do your thing I do my thing we

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,879
leave each other alone is that kind of

115
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,879
what's going on here yes more or less

116
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,639
more or less and this is the result of

117
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:28,600
the our movement or let's say activism

118
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,400
in last 15 years you know uh because we

119
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,160
didn't we were mostly focused on the

120
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:39,159
patients and the sick people mhm not on

121
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,439
the smoking M yeah yeah and uh with this

122
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,080
especially if you have a lot of

123
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,319
scientific data

124
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:50,839
behind uh you you turn over the public

125
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,919
opinion against some things mhm you know

126
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:57,799
uh we already started and the one reason

127
00:05:53,918 --> 00:06:01,318
is also because we organized like 10

128
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,680
scientific conferences until now mhm uh

129
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,319
back in the days when I was in jail it

130
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,360
was everywhere in on the national

131
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,039
television all newspapers you know

132
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,720
magazines and this is when people start

133
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,360
to think really you know when so I

134
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
remember when you went to jail and there

135
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,280
was a there was a movement here in

136
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:24,799
Slovenia to free bjo yes um and that's

137
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,198
that's still your email domain to the

138
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,120
state can you tell us what happened

139
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,120
because as far as I know you went

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,519
on a hunger strike in prison yes I went

141
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,038
on a h hunger strike interesting times

142
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:43,839
uh yeah the I was I had open one old

143
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,399
case from

144
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:50,318
2008 uh but I wasn't prosecuted for 4

145
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:54,918
years and then in

146
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,240
2012 uh they imprisoned me uh because of

147
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,918
uh few

148
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,478
plants you know on my garden

149
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:06,240
uh but I openly grow cannabis since I

150
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,478
don't know 20 or more years I never hid

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:14,319
it because you cannot hide a 4 met plant

152
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:17,519
on your in your garden you know um so I

153
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,840
knew it was very unjust because it was

154
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:24,240
for actually very small amount yeah you

155
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:28,318
know and uh the judge

156
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,800
was let's say not very happy with

157
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,160
cannabis because I live in very rural

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,680
area on the Hungarian border and the

159
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,400
situation there is way different than in

160
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,280
lublana you know uh I used to have a

161
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:46,198
friend he unfortunately died he I met

162
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:50,119
him in prison where he got in morco soot

163
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,639
a one year prison for one gram of wheat

164
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,038
one gr was that a possessions charge or

165
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,840
did they somehow get for cultivating or

166
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,878
Distributing too no just possession just

167
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:05,478
possession year for that how long ago

168
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,400
was that uh 12 years only 12 years ago

169
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,639
and you don't just to to to interject do

170
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,799
you think that would happen now no not

171
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,680
even in your area and that was also

172
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,800
unjust in in in uh for that time it was

173
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,000
an abnormal case very abnormal case and

174
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,560
I didn't know actually that it happened

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,959
until uh I went to the jail and he was

176
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,519
in the same cell with me and he

177
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:31,759
presented me the papers you yeah because

178
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:36,240
Canabis you know in

179
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:40,799
Slovenia let's say 20 15 years ago was

180
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,000
uh easy money for police for prosecutors

181
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,399
for attorneys and for J yeah so that's

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,600
what I mean about the police state

183
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,360
usually the police will or a lot of

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,920
jurisdictions they'll go for that

185
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:55,000
low-lying fruit so how did that

186
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:59,559
change they realized that it's

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,879
counterproductive you know uh I I am

188
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:06,879
helping people since 2012 when I was in

189
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:09,360
jail I can tell you that we freed uh at

190
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:14,559
least 15 or 20 people on the Supreme

191
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,440
Court who were already uh already um no

192
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,278
convicted so you know so your activism

193
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,000
work started setting new precedents yes

194
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:26,200
uhhuh all the way to the all the way to

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,320
the Supreme Court mhm yeah I was lucky

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:35,399
to have a good uh friend uh

197
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:40,079
very high in this circles lawyer and so

198
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:43,600
on and he advised me how to do it but uh

199
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:46,439
I was always calling out the human

200
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,399
rights you know the human rights aspect

201
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,680
of why we should cannabis prohibition of

202
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,200
course we have listen cannabis is the

203
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:58,319
most research plant on the planet more

204
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,920
than 150,000 studies it means like seven

205
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
studies a day

206
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,319
are published on cannabis and we are

207
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,759
still imprisoning people because they

208
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,278
want to help themselves you know this is

209
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:14,958
this is really crazy because none of

210
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:17,679
those who were convicted was uh

211
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:21,919
trafficker it was always just for

212
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:24,278
themsel growing growing cannabis at home

213
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,039
you know so you're talking about a lot

214
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:29,320
of convictions in Slovenia we're just

215
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,719
for cultivating at home cultivating most

216
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,680
mostly in possession uhhuh it was never

217
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,240
trafficking even mentioned but you know

218
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:42,039
courts and uh prosecutors they

219
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,919
somehow put on the on this Eagle Eagle

220
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,599
uh equal scale yeah it should not be

221
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,519
trafficking is trafficking and

222
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,320
possession is something else for sure

223
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,839
yeah I mean I think it all should be we

224
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,160
are we both think it all should be legal

225
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,440
but when you're looking at it from a

226
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,439
legal lens clearly one's more benign

227
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,839
than the other I would say legal you

228
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,480
know legal uh I agree but uh cannabis is

229
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,839
legal in Slovenia like right now

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,360
legality it means that we have certain

231
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,839
laws about cannabis but it should be

232
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,360
regulated

233
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:19,160
more more logically and more uh

234
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,360
towards patient orientated you know so

235
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,078
if you could what would you do if if you

236
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,959
could snap your fingers and make new

237
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,958
policy now in Slovenia what would you do

238
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,559
and is there any are there any other

239
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,958
countri countes in Europe or the or

240
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:38,159
America or the or states in America or

241
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:42,719
the world that you see as um

242
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:46,519
exam examples to use for Slovenia

243
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,440
uh if I pick from different countries

244
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,639
different regulations we can put

245
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,839
something good together you know what I

246
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,360
mean because always something what

247
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,920
should not be Let's uh for example Czech

248
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,639
Republic yeah they legalized how many 15

249
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:05,399
years ago yeah where we are now and uh

250
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,200
last year when I was on Cana Fest the

251
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,559
police is still bothering people for

252
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,278
smoking a joint on the cannabis event

253
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,359
you know it's really don't but still

254
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,919
they can AFF Fest their police still

255
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,759
because I knew I heard they were

256
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,078
sometimes at cultiva a couple years very

257
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,399
also in cultiva many people are losing

258
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,559
their driver's license you know because

259
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,198
they are checking this is another issue

260
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,039
with cannabis uh you know it's crazy

261
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,559
America when they used to just uh cops

262
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,198
used to just sit outside the Grateful

263
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,359
Dead wait till the Grateful Dead

264
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:39,679
concerts were over and just bust people

265
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,839
but you know very similar yeah very

266
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:47,078
similar but we we cannabis users and

267
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,839
cannabis scientist let's put it that way

268
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:53,958
we know that cannabis has no influence

269
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,120
on the driving when you are regular

270
00:12:53,958 --> 00:13:00,119
user well that's funny and sorry if you

271
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,919
don't mix it with alcohol of course yeah

272
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,320
of course well that's funny you say that

273
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,799
because there I think there's two

274
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,120
studies done on that there was a study I

275
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:11,039
think in Jamaica done about that uh

276
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,240
driving in cannabis and you know I think

277
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,319
that's the dirty little unknown secret

278
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,399
you know that all us cannabis users

279
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,278
clearly know that you're not impaired

280
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,799
because it's a matter of impairment you

281
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,879
know cuz I know when I've had three or

282
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,479
four drinks in a couple hours maybe if I

283
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:31,198
know I probably shouldn't drive you know

284
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,560
but when it comes to cannabis you it you

285
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:35,559
just you know your impairment level each

286
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,759
individual knows their impairment level

287
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,518
so there was another study done by I

288
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,198
think it was sanj Gupta when he came out

289
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,759
with that second uh CNN that his first

290
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:45,198
one was the charlott's web which blew

291
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,600
everything up you know which really

292
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,958
helped the the movement in America and

293
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,680
Beyond and then the second he said

294
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,359
that's was their conclusion is they did

295
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,958
a they did a an experiment and they had

296
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,240
a two I guess you'd call them test

297
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,559
groups not a control group but their

298
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,198
there was the the drivers who were uh

299
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,919
who were had smoked not see this is the

300
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,719
point just because you smoke pot doesn't

301
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,879
mean you're stoned so there was the

302
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,320
drivers that smoked pot that had smoke

303
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,000
that were regular pot smokers and then

304
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,278
there was the drivers who smoked pot

305
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,919
that were uh uh not regular uh pot

306
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:24,639
smokers and clearly uh the drivers with

307
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:27,078
that could uh that were regular users

308
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,919
were were not impaired they they drove

309
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,198
perfectly fine and the the ones who

310
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,958
weren't used to cannabis and were just

311
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:35,679
high as [ __ ] you know it's like you

312
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,879
wouldn't recommend to anyone who who was

313
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,559
a novice uh you know it's like hey if

314
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,559
you're going to smoke don't don't drive

315
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:45,078
so I think these are like really

316
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:47,239
interesting almost esoteric uh facts in

317
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:50,159
the Cannabis world that make cannabis

318
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,600
something like you know it in alcohol

319
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,958
you can even in alcohol there's there's

320
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,879
hey you could have8 08 in your system

321
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,518
and some people be able to drive better

322
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,759
than others yes and some people are not

323
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,120
able with uh 0.2 in the system ex

324
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,639
exactly therefore the doctor's job is to

325
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,959
determine your impairment exactly

326
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,198
exactly no not just because I have

327
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:17,239
metabolites in the blood you know I I

328
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:20,838
smoke for

329
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,839
47 years now cannabis I have to knock on

330
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,880
wood I never had car accident and I

331
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,000
smoke all the time you know me yeah uh

332
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,600
so uh I can clearly say it doesn't

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,679
affect driving you drive slower you

334
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,720
drive way more careful right especially

335
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,120
than on alcohol but there is another

336
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,160
senses are heightened too of course

337
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,799
there is also another thing last year I

338
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,958
was on

339
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:49,439
the Parliamentary committee for health

340
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,559
health committee and there was also a

341
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,120
guy from

342
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:57,439
police Ministry of uh Internal Affairs

343
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:01,000
and he was you know giving us some data

344
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,920
on the traffic accident and so on so

345
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,159
alcohol is responsible for more than 30%

346
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,958
of all uh ex car accidents in

347
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,039
Slovenia and you can have up to

348
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,000
0.5 you know is that what it is in

349
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:20,559
Slovenia yes

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,159
0.5 uh you don't pay a fine and later if

351
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:27,278
you're drunk as hell you can get your

352
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:32,679
driver's license back on pero mhm you

353
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:36,159
know uh and you pay some fine the in

354
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:39,198
cannabis or all drugs in Slovenia are

355
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:43,879
responsible for 0.3% of the all

356
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:47,879
accidents uhhuh uhhuh and you pay 100

357
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:50,360
1,800 Euro fine and uh they take your

358
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,720
driver's license away for what yeah and

359
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,800
they take it if you're driving I heard

360
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,120
in Germany they take your driver's

361
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,719
license if you just get caught with

362
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,159
cannabis in your system even if you're

363
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,199
driving or not yes

364
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,119
it's crazy you know it should not be uh

365
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:09,038
and there is another issue which I want

366
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,438
I hope that I will uh soon bring

367
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:15,838
somebody's case to the Supreme Court uh

368
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:20,079
because nowadays also in uh Public

369
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:24,240
Service Services uh public jobs let's

370
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:27,359
say you know Court police and so you

371
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,519
should not use cannabis at all do they

372
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:33,558
drug test yes and this is completely

373
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:36,200
against the Constitution because if you

374
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:39,399
are my uh

375
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,360
employer it's not your business what I

376
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:47,679
do outside of my working time yeah yeah

377
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:51,279
yeah until I uh I fulfill my

378
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,519
contract uh with you as the employer do

379
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,319
they add prescription drugs to that

380
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,480
also uh not really not really just

381
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,519
ilicit drugs just elicit drug drugs but

382
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,679
you know elicit drugs are more than 400

383
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,639
uh in on the list but they just check a

384
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,679
few cocaine

385
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,679
heroin and uh cannabis and

386
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,640
methamphetamines maybe and such no but

387
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,000
again here is the here's the the Crux of

388
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,759
the issue I think is impairment if

389
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,038
you're driving are you impaired or not

390
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,679
if you're at work are you doing a good

391
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:28,200
job or not are you in and I think a lot

392
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,440
of this stuff I know a lot of this stuff

393
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,600
in America has to do with liability

394
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,120
issues and so they've got to they've got

395
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:38,079
to put the blame on someone at some time

396
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,558
yes uh the system and so they'll they'll

397
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,639
basically you know because of liability

398
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,558
they'll have to be like well hit a canis

399
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,960
well no you even though that's mistake

400
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:52,000
was made but but it we can't associate

401
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:55,279
it with you being impaired it's some

402
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,279
maybe other spous thing that happened

403
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:01,200
that well you've got to go you drug

404
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:03,599
tested no so but this could be a good

405
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,600
employee but then the system is

406
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,519
compelled to fire them or let them go

407
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,558
because of liability stuff is that

408
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,918
similar in Slovenia at all because I

409
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,158
generally in Europe they don't have

410
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,880
quite as much liability Europe is very

411
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,960
very very strange on this issue of

412
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,320
cannabis and drugs you know because

413
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:29,000
Europe have a big uh bureaucrat system

414
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,519
and it's divided from Europe to the

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,599
national

416
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:37,158
and Europe is not good example for

417
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,959
anything uh on the field of drugs but uh

418
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,919
there are some

419
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,000
uh bright lights I'll just talk about

420
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,360
drugs makes me want small yeah uh you

421
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,240
know there are bright lights like uh

422
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:54,038
Malta now uh Germany especially because

423
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Germany is very strong country in

424
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:59,119
European Union

425
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,279
Luxembourg and others but the differ you

426
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:05,199
know we live in the same countries it's

427
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:08,038
similar like in the states in California

428
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,840
or in you can smoke anywhere everywhere

429
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:11,558
but in Arkansas they will lock you up

430
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:16,038
for 20 years right right right right

431
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:19,960
right you know it's it's crazy and uh I

432
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:24,798
think that punishment and the uh

433
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,159
the policies towards any drugs should be

434
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,240
based on

435
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,559
scientific data not just because use

436
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,880
drugs you know do you think it's going

437
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,480
to change and and doesn't I hope so and

438
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,840
do you think obviously the EU has to or

439
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,120
the UN and the EU have to change their

440
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,839
their mandates towards towards drug

441
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,439
policy or or Germany just has to do what

442
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,240
Canada does and just say [ __ ] it we're

443
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,519
going to do what we what we want you

444
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,319
can't really how punitive can you be

445
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:56,400
against us or towards us uh if if it's

446
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,079
Germany the economic engine so I'm not

447
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,480
sure if Germany will good example for

448
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:04,319
Germany now you mentioned Germany is

449
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,279
that they asked European Union if they

450
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,519
agree you know with the changes on

451
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:13,079
cannabis policy in Germany and they

452
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:16,200
didn't but they did it anyway right you

453
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,960
know what I mean right so it can be done

454
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,159
right it can be done and more uh more

455
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,600
States or more countries will join this

456
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,880
club easier will be for others so so for

457
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,359
Slovenia are they ever going to they're

458
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,440
so small you know we only have so much

459
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:37,439
arable land here are they uh where do

460
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,759
you think uh where's Slovenia is uh

461
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,919
niche in terms of the Cannabis Market in

462
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:49,240
Europe the niche is knowledge

463
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,038
science and boutique products we don't

464
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,640
have big areas like Ukraine or you know

465
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:57,599
other big countries to have thousands of

466
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,520
hectares of hemp Slovenia is 22,000

467
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,519
square kilometers

468
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:05,440
you know it's that's a size of New New

469
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:07,278
Jersey yeah something like that uh but

470
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,278
uh maybe

471
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:13,720
until last September when you organized

472
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:16,119
the ICBC in uh in Blade you didn't even

473
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,440
realize how much knowledge is already in

474
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:23,199
Slovenia you know how many people are uh

475
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,600
uh working on the Cannabis research from

476
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,640
hops Institute to everywhere actually

477
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:32,678
yeah and uh this event was very good

478
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,600
because we showed the Cannabis and all

479
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,840
the movement from different angles so

480
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:42,119
you have a company uh you're not just an

481
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:44,199
activist you're a businessman also uh

482
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,319
tell us a little bit about your company

483
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,600
uh research nature

484
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:53,759
yes uh it's all started back in

485
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:57,839
2014 when I realize that there will be

486
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:59,759
no changes if you don't do it properly

487
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:03,278
so I start

488
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:06,759
organizing uh scientific conferences MH

489
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:09,240
I uh I invited people the best uh

490
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:10,359
researchers uh researchers from all over

491
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,679
the

492
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:17,558
world uh and

493
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:21,278
we started that way then I realized that

494
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:23,639
it's not enough if I want to do

495
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:26,679
something or we all together want to do

496
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:31,600
something with this field we have

497
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:34,559
to take scientific approach so I or uh I

498
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:40,278
founded research nature Institute with

499
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:44,200
my unfortunately late um partner from

500
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:47,038
Slovakia uh the guy had a prostate

501
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,080
cancer and he was cured of it now he

502
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:54,798
died from some other things uh which

503
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:59,399
were uh we will not talk about this

504
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:04,079
today uh and he bought us

505
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:06,919
uh uh gcms so you know gas

506
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:10,918
chromatography because one of the goals

507
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:14,880
was I wanted to prove to our uh

508
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:17,278
government that there is no influence on

509
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,200
driving uh under

510
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:23,480
the when you smoke cannabis so uh there

511
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,000
was a project with Ministry of internal

512
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,120
affairs and police where we wanted

513
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,159
because we have some polygons in ransco

514
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,000
for safe driving you know where we

515
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,520
wanted to

516
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,640
prove what is the influence of cannabis

517
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:42,319
on the average but they stepped back and

518
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,960
you know because they know uhuh there is

519
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,918
no

520
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,798
influence but then again already back in

521
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,278
2015 we started to profiling the

522
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:57,519
Cannabis products uh which are on the

523
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:59,519
black market people buying from dealers

524
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,879
you know or

525
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:06,119
suppliers and uh then step by step we

526
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,159
developed then uh you know lot of

527
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:12,599
product projects going

528
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:15,799
on then with my uh colleague

529
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,719
Roman uh we someh how succeed I still

530
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:21,038
don't know how that was with that was

531
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,200
with University of L yes yes so there

532
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:27,158
was an idea Roman you know Roman stukel

533
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,080
he was on the faculty of Health Sciences

534
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,840
doing some other things

535
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:35,720
and he said uh listen we could do

536
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,918
something would you buy Dad UV detector

537
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,600
for cannabinoids you know and maybe we

538
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,559
start profiling cannaboids and I said of

539
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,918
course you know and that's when you

540
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,359
started working with the University of

541
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,600
Lan yes so first we bought I bought our

542
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,798
our Institute bought thead

543
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:57,839
detector and when the we got the gcms we

544
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:00,759
signed the agreement of cooperation and

545
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:03,319
I in installed the GCM at the machine on

546
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,038
the in the laboratory of faculty in

547
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:09,678
lublana

548
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:13,200
uhhuh so that was the start until now we

549
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:16,200
um participated on 12

550
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,679
phds with our machine with our help

551
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,759
uhhuh uh we are profiling for uh for

552
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,519
patients for Growers for

553
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:29,200
industry uh you know

554
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,038
so as any other thing it's Dev in

555
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,798
through through years if people want to

556
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,679
reach out to you uh is there a website

557
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:39,960
you can go to research.com

558
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:43,840
research.com yes but you know uh

559
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,600
Slovenia is so small that hardly anybody

560
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,639
is this just for slovenians or can other

561
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,599
people outside of Slovenian participate

562
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,520
it's uh outside we also do some uh

563
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:57,079
profiling for big companies

564
00:26:53,519 --> 00:27:01,000
uhhuh uh but still we are growing muh

565
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,678
you know and you have to start small and

566
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,440
well for sure and Slovenia is small it's

567
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,399
a great place to Beta products I I think

568
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,320
and uh if you can make it in Slovenia I

569
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:11,759
think you can make it uh anywhere and uh

570
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,079
what's what's great about what you said

571
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,440
is Slovenia does have it's like a A

572
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:19,398
Little Switzerland a little Holland a

573
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,278
little Israel that's how I feel when I'm

574
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,079
here a little bit of everything yeah and

575
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,159
the people have this connection they're

576
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,359
very high Highly Educated people I think

577
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:31,320
it's the Dutch and the slovenians that

578
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:35,240
speak the most languages per country uh

579
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,599
uh uh per individual uh on average and

580
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,000
and when I'm here I'm really Blown Away

581
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:43,798
by the the talent uh in Slovenia and all

582
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the research capabilities you know we've

583
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:47,679
had meetings with uh all the all the

584
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,159
people we've had meetings with all these

585
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:55,080
institutions and uh it's uh it's a high

586
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:56,640
level of uh work that they that they do

587
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,918
and uh I think it's only a matter of

588
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,679
time that I agree with you I think that

589
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:05,679
slovenia's Niche is research and

590
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,960
development and I'm excited toh see

591
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,960
where where that goes but uh but I have

592
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,640
an important question to ask you Bojo um

593
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,840
so how old were you when you first when

594
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,278
you first smoke weed 13 13 where was

595
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,599
that in mka so in Mora behind the school

596
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,798
behind the school yes did you get

597
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,719
high you know cuz sometimes you smoke

598
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:28,158
the first couple yeah not I didn't get

599
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,079
high the first time I either not really

600
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,960
I was 12 yeah but you know back in the

601
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,960
days that was

602
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:41,918
1975 uh-huh nobody bothered us because

603
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,640
of cannabis it's all started later when

604
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,559
let's say after

605
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,559
the 2000 so that was actually one of my

606
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,640
questions so it started after 2000

607
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,839
interesting what was the Canabis scene

608
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,278
like in Yugoslavia because that in the

609
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,639
70s was obviously Yugoslavia it was

610
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:05,359
elicit drug it was ilicit nobody but

611
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,799
nobody gave a [ __ ] so kind of like kind

612
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:14,199
of like now or in like now now like no

613
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:17,038
it was you know hard to buy hard to get

614
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,080
but it was everywhere I studied in in

615
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:23,359
lublana everywhere everybody was smoking

616
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:26,000
cannabis you know yeah but more hiding

617
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:29,359
it was more private it's not it's not

618
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,200
open like today but no body went to jail

619
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,119
actually and who was using cannabis then

620
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,000
did did it have a certain demographic

621
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:41,558
like the the the the the the the artists

622
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,159
quote unquote or was it the the workers

623
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:47,119
or was it students you know fessors yeah

624
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,840
it was still a hippie movement back in'

625
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:53,319
70s uhhuh yeah you know yeah because uh

626
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:55,678
I don't know what your audience think

627
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,639
about former Yugoslavia but former

628
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,080
Yugoslavia was not the Eastern block we

629
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,200
could go anywhere with Yugoslavian so I

630
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,278
think that's a really good distinction

631
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,840
that the audience should know because I

632
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:12,359
uh it's a it's a very it's a big

633
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,959
misconception that Yugoslavia was part

634
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,479
of the Eastern block which meant that it

635
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,720
was part of the Soviet Union which meant

636
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,960
that it was more of a stalinistic

637
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:26,319
communism not at all it wasn't it was a

638
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,480
Tito communism which is bordering on

639
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,359
like heavy socialism I think the biggest

640
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,720
distinction cuz I remember growing up

641
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,918
you know in the 70s and ' 80s and and

642
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,159
and thinking the Soviet Union was the

643
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,360
most evil place in the world solely

644
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,840
because you couldn't leave the country

645
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,759
without special permission and we had

646
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,519
people that would defect and that was

647
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:50,480
always like a big thing um but I but but

648
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,200
but in Yugoslavia you didn't have that

649
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,839
restriction correct no you could you

650
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,558
could go travel anywhere yeah with

651
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,879
Yugoslavian pport passport could travel

652
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,519
to Moscow or to Afghanistan or to yeah I

653
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,399
remember there was United States

654
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,798
wherever that the Yugoslavian passport

655
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:09,638
actually could go to more countries than

656
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:12,960
an American passport for a while or yes

657
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:16,839
uh actually Yugoslavia was a promised

658
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,159
land for Easter block mhm because uh

659
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,240
hungarians bulgarians everything

660
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,639
surrounding it they they could not go to

661
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,399
the vest but they could go to Slovenia

662
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:27,719
to Yugoslavia really really interesting

663
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:29,319
because Czechs slovaks hungarians they

664
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,038
uh visited

665
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:35,200
Yugoslavia U the coast Dalmatian Coast

666
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,240
as a tourist really oh I didn't know

667
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,759
that that's fascinating but so they

668
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,079
could go as a tourist but then couldn't

669
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,960
they if they wanted to escape then from

670
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,480
CAA

671
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,519
was you know I live just in Hungarian

672
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,200
bord and my

673
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:57,240
uh uh Aunt lived in um Hungary uhhuh and

674
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:02,600
always when uh their um family came over

675
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:05,519
one of family has to stay home so I get

676
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:09,240
it you know what I mean yeah so you can

677
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,440
go but somebody is behind oh my God yeah

678
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,240
and I think that's the reason most

679
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,919
people didn't defect because of those

680
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,319
yeah that's that's a really good point

681
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,159
but interesting I didn't know that they

682
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,158
had the privilege to come into

683
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,080
Yugoslavia so they could go to they

684
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,960
could go to De brck or split or

685
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:27,439
something oh W that's that's interesting

686
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,399
so the Cannabis scene but then you said

687
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,639
in

688
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,119
okay so then Yugoslavia breaks up

689
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:35,678
Slovenia becomes a country what in ' 91

690
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,398
something like that yes and then and

691
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,798
then it then you then it got bad for 10

692
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,558
years is or things started decline first

693
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:47,960
10 years it was a chaos uhhuh more or

694
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:51,200
less but then in 2000 we accepted uh uh

695
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,278
the law about the illicit drugs uhhuh

696
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,000
and then the

697
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:59,240
bureaucrats saw their opportunity and

698
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,079
police and they started to really push

699
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,038
you know oh so it started to get bad in

700
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:07,278
2000 yes in 2000 was and then after this

701
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,440
uh that because Slovenia was coming into

702
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,319
the EU and wanted to be a good boy or

703
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,240
whatever no just because the new law you

704
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,278
know just because of the new law uh

705
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,159
because always when the new law is

706
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,960
introduced they want to show that they

707
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:29,039
are fulfilling everything but uh it

708
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:33,278
doesn't uh last for long you know uh um

709
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:37,319
because uh they mixed up criminal law

710
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:40,880
with the minor uh offenses because since

711
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:44,519
2000 nobody in Slovenia or yugos

712
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,039
Slovenia sorry should not be jailed for

713
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:51,519
possession of any illicit drug because

714
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:53,759
possession is not a criminal offense

715
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,880
trafficing Cas yeah yeah yeah so that's

716
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:59,319
when you say drugs are or cannabis is

717
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,000
legal you kind of you said before that's

718
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:05,480
the qualifier right there uhhuh yes uh

719
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,358
but the problem is that every bureaucrat

720
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:13,878
or every police or every prosecutor you

721
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,878
know try to push a bit more so yeah well

722
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,799
so but they they can't and when you say

723
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,960
try the prosecutor would then have to go

724
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,599
for well they're trafficking or

725
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,240
something right because they can't get

726
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,159
them for possession and for trafficking

727
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:31,039
they have very very stupid reasons like

728
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,878
too high electricity

729
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,320
consumption or if you are unemployed and

730
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:39,239
you have plants at home you will sell

731
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,960
them and such a [ __ ] you know so

732
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:45,239
without any evidence and this is what we

733
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,800
start to fight and today you know a

734
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:52,039
friend of mine the doctor medical doctor

735
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,960
grew for his wife cannabis because he

736
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:58,159
has cancer and police came they want to

737
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,000
prosecute him but it stops on the

738
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,358
first level on the court you this is not

739
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,599
a criminal offense yeah right right so

740
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,440
the police will still sometimes try to

741
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,960
yes push where they can and then at the

742
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,639
generally the first level especially

743
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,838
some rookies in police uhhuh you know

744
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:21,239
they want to prove themsel mhm but

745
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:24,559
uh before Slovenia had around 2,500

746
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:26,838
criminal cases on cannabis a year on two

747
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,199
two million people that's a lot mhm you

748
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:30,239
know yeah

749
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,118
but that's a lot that's a lot it's two

750
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:37,879
and a half or it's 1

751
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,680
1.25% yeah uh not as much as in the

752
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,800
States but a lot it's a lot well I don't

753
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:45,239
know per capita that's almost as much as

754
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,000
the states maybe per capita but not

755
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,919
today anymore not today anymore if they

756
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,159
don't catch you with really big big big

757
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,440
amount with some proof of trafficking

758
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,480
you will just get fine or not even this

759
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,599
I feel extremely safe so was that the

760
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,400
time you became an

761
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:07,039
activist yeah the the activist what is

762
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,200
activism you know yeah uh when you

763
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:12,960
proactively started to the first the big

764
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:17,078
jump into activism was when I was impr

765
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:20,440
prisoned you know then I was stupid and

766
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,880
stubborn enough that I said [ __ ] you I

767

know I just got on pero for one year so

778
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:00,280

00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:46,400
charges and I was actually just one was

820
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,799
and successful for and that was your

821
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,880
probation then you got from that oh my

822
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,240
God what a story well I know you changed

823
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,400
Slovenia in a big way uh and uh you know

824
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:58,838
I think that's really important for

825
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,480
people to know in the cannabis

826
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:04,239
industry we think we just got here and

827
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,639
now here we are but there was a lot of

828
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:10,159
people who took risk went to prison

829
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:13,039
actually cared about it you know it's

830
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,838
not just the economics of cannabis

831
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,400
shouldn't be legal because the economics

832
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:19,000
it might be legal because of the

833
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,039
economics of it exactly but the human

834
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,639
rights aspect of it is the it's a civil

835
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:28,880
liberty to uh to use cannabis and I

836
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:32,078
think you you proved that in uh in uh

837
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,640
Slovenia and made really big inroads in

838
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,000
the culture

839
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:41,400
here we all did yes it was a long way

840
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,599
with torny way you know uh but yeah you

841
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,480
can see the difference you started to

842
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,559
come to Slovenia 20 years ago mhm 20 21

843
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,079
years how was 20 years ago everybody

844
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,559
hiding more or less actually 20 years so

845
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,079
that was so that was that's actually a

846
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:57,480
funny story because that's one of the

847
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:01,560
reasons I fell in love with Slovenia

848
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,079
because I Mo I I came here in 2002 to

849
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,920
pan right and I had a little tiny piece

850
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,318
of hash with me and then after like 3

851
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,760
days it was gone so I started I started

852
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,318
asking on the streets in puran and the

853
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,280
first thing when I did get to puran

854
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:17,039
spray painted on the rocks on the

855
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:21,599
prominade around the Punta yeah uh was

856
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:25,679
Pam P PanAm PanAm and I was like pamer

857
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:28,000
Dam Oh shoot that's that's cool and so

858
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:30,118
then and this is a true story

859
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,760
so I found someone on the street he I

860
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,119
said can I get some weed he's like he

861
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,440
said yeah come to the Puna bar at

862
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:42,358
7:00 at 1900 and I said okay so I went

863
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,318
to the Puna bar and I uh was expecting

864
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,838
to see him just in the cut in the corner

865
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,358
or whatever in back and he was at the

866
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,719
the Shrunk the uh the the bar she was he

867
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:55,440
was at he was at the bar behind the bar

868
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,439
and I was like uh Hey and he was like

869
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,920
Hey and I was like you know I just

870
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,599
wanted uh an uh like a few five grams or

871
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,639
whatever and back then it was toll ours

872
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,480
and he was like well it's 5,000 tolls or

873
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,598
something like that right which would be

874
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,119
about 20 EUR or something like that and

875
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,599
he reached under the counter and without

876
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,318
a bag or anything just put some I think

877
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,599
it was some Albanian wheed so it was CED

878
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:25,079
whatever but I was happy to have

879
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,519
something and uh I just looked at him I

880
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,160
looked at him I gave him the 5,000 totet

881
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:31,079
and he just looked at me and there was

882
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:34,039
the weed all over the and I just took my

883
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,039
shirt and I put it into my shirt rolled

884
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:39,039
up my shirt and kind of duck walk back

885
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:41,400
to my hotel with my weed and my shirt

886
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,559
and I just knew that I had found home at

887
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,639
that point you know what I mean so for

888
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,838
me and you stayed yeah and I was coming

889
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:50,239
I had I had lived in Amsterdam for that

890
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,000
yeah and I stayed um and but I was

891
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,279
living in Amsterdam and I actually

892
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,920
thought wow this there's something even

893
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,680
more free maybe that's cuz that was

894
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,358
obala that's how we say Co here

895
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,318
in but uh maybe there was some other you

896
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:06,440
know little bit different Spirit but I

897
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:09,239
also remember going to lublana at that

898
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,240
time and going to the schmoutz and

899
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,279
smoking weed at the schmoutz and nobody

900
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,959
gave a [ __ ] and I was like exactly I was

901
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,680
like wow this is uh this is uh this is

902
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,838
insane it felt it felt so open even back

903
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:25,598
then right

904
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:28,000
now people seem to smoke everywhere in

905
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,400
lublana and it's no big deal when you

906
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
pass through Liana every 5 m you smell

907
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,160
wheat or something you know yeah boo so

908
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
even 20 years ago it was pretty open and

909
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,838
that just shows how crazy it is because

910
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,440
you were on the coast and in Liana if

911
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,639
you would come to our region then it's

912
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,200
something else I know I know I I moved

913
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:50,199
to styka for a while and it was it was

914
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,719
definitely different but at the same

915
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:56,679
time there was the I used to go to a

916
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,639
place called picara to do music and it

917
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,799
was like

918
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:02,799
it was like it felt like what was

919
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,359
Christiana in h Denmark where they kind

920
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,440
of have that open that squat that open

921
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,279
free yeah or matela or well matela I

922
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,400
didn't know

923
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,119
matela actually I did know I knew they

924
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,599
both existed so matela is is the bigger

925
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,119
version of uh the free state of lublana

926
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:21,800
where they take the old army barracks

927
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,838
and turn it into a a squatter's uh uh

928
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,680
area and then the squatters make it what

929
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:28,639
it is and the cops kind of leave them

930
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,358
alone or it's to at it's tolerated here

931
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,199
and then when

932
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:35,400
rookies are in Liana because they send

933
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,118
them usually from the rural area to

934
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,119
lublana they may have some problems you

935
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,680
know but it's very

936
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,760
very rare that you have any problems

937
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,679
because I will tell you do you think

938
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,040
that police didn't knew what is going on

939
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,919
in PNA or in metova they could raid the

940
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:56,440
place every day yeah right but they

941
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,159
didn't right because not nothing

942
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,440
happened there there was never any

943
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:03,078
problems you know what I mean because

944
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,760
where is the wheat there is no problem

945
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,119
right that's that's amazing and that's

946
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,720
why that's why I that's one of the

947
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,519
reasons I I've always loved Slovenia uh

948
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,358
they're just really cool on the weed

949
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,039
scene and you go outside of Slovenia you

950
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,679
don't feel that safe or that yeah and

951
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,719
then you come back into Slovenia and you

952
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:21,399
feel super safe so here we are in

953
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,159
Slovenia with this very open liberal

954
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,838
these very open and liberal attitudes

955
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:28,358
towards

956
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:31,679
cannabis politically or policy wise eyes

957
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:33,239
uh where do you see Slovenia in 5 years

958
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,279
do you have hope that things are going

959
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:38,959
to change in Slovenia yes my hope is for

960
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,480
years now I guess you always got to you

961
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,240
got to always have hope yeah but uh now

962
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,880
you are in Slovenia and you know a bit

963
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:53,000
about our political system about our

964
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,200
parties and so on yeah we have usually

965
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,119
we have very unstable governments rarely

966
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:03,078
one government stays all four years you

967
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,519
know yeah and before the election they

968
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,318
all promising we will do it we will make

969
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:11,358
it better we will legalize or regulate

970
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:14,759
or whatever but they all forget after

971
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:16,440
the elections mhm and this is now for 20

972
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,400
years like this I guess the better

973
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,318
question is where do you want Slovenia

974
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,240
to be in 5 years normal country uhhuh

975
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:28,719
you know regarding human rights because

976
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:33,159
uh uh you use of cannabis is also human

977
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:35,838
right because every use of cannabis is

978
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:38,039
therapeutic and what has to happen then

979
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,960

995
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:28,760
