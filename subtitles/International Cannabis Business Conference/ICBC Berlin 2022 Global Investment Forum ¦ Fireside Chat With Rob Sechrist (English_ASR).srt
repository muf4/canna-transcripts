1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,080
so i'm very excited to introduce our

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,638
guest here today another california

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,359
industry pioneer uh to talk about some

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,278
of your insights and experiences in

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,079
cannabis financing

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,439
so

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,719
let's just kick it right off i just want

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,719
you to tell me a little bit about

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,640
yourself and your background and what

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,399
brought you into cannabis investing well

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,320
thanks mary and thanks for having me

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,079
we're happy to be here

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,000
we just attended the last conference at

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,039
london and that went very well and we'll

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,399
be at the uh the conference in zurich um

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,558
we find these conferences very

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
informative to aggregate all the

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,640
information that's coming in through uh

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,480
the european markets and and basically

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,520
everywhere outside of the united states

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,000
market but we were the first dedicated

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,879
lender in the united states that was

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,799
privately held doing bridge loans to

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,479
cannabis use specialties properties in

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,799
the united states

26
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,959
prior to entering cannabis we've done 5

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,000
000 transactions for over 5 billion

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
dollars

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,640
we had the skill set when our local

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,640
congressman dana rohrabacher

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
passed the roebuck or blumenar amendment

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,640
which in the united states was the most

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,560
consequential legislation ever passed

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
that nobody ever talks about that

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,719
legislation defunded the department of

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,799
justice from any prosecution of a

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,319
cannabis related business so

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,400
when congress used what we call the

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,839
power of the purse to take away the

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
money from the department of justice

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
from prosecution we quickly realized

42
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,000
this was the largest newly created asset

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,079
class in the world

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,159
of 50 billion dollars is now what we

45
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,359
have been able to project out that just

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,000
the real estate asset class in the

47
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,560
united states so we started lending in

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,959
the sector by 2016 and today we've done

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,640
69 transactions for 435 million with 34

50
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,478
payoffs we've originated more

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,280
transactions had more payoffs than any

52
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,679
other lender and we've seen over 2 000

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
transactions in just the cannabis sector

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
we've also aggregated all that data to

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
have the most robust data sets of

56
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,759
anybody in the world

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,399
wow that's incredible thank you for

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,199
giving us that great background

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,120
you know it seems like six years is a

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,919
short time but in cannabis years it's a

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,920
very long time uh it's been about 10

62
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,919
years since the united states started

63
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,479
really getting into commercial cannabis

64
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,280
for personal legal use

65
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,959
and you know 10 years into it

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,159
knowing what you know now is there

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
anything that you would have done

68
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,159
differently

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
when you were getting started

70
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,280
we're on the real estate side so we're

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,800
not um

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,598
owners in the cannabis equity businesses

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,760
so

74
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,199
we tried to move into it as early as we

75
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,799
possibly could

76
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,560
2014

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,439
was the year that that legislation

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,759
passed

79
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:52,239
we were actually trying to lend in 2014.

80
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:55,039
just couldn't get our third party

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,158
service providers title insurance

82
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,158
property insurance our investors our

83
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,079
legal teams our compliance our errors

84
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,878
and admissions insurance to sign off on

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
it

86
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,878
and

87
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,359
you know being a leader in an industry

88
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,719
is not always about doing things in the

89
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
most center of this of a circle of the

90
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,318
of it being the safest in the center

91
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,238
sometimes you need to be all the way to

92
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,359
the edge of the outer perimeter of that

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,840
circle where you're on the edge of risk

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,720
and so that that that circle of of what

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,120
risky is and what what is on being on

96
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,519
the edge is something that as you're a

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
leader in an industry you're constantly

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,759
redefining that and you're we're

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,480
poloris was the one that was

100
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,798
establishing getting the first fdic

101
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,238
insured warehouse lines of credits

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
getting the first investment credit

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
grade ratings in the industry getting

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,360
the first institutional

105
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:54,000
uh investors as a privately held fund so

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
you know that that per the the risk is

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,560
perception and if you have the data and

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,480
the facts to back back you up you can

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
continually move that that risk

110
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,479
perspective out as long as you're

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,200
shoring it up with with

112
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,560
facts and data to to de-risk the

113
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,560
downside of it

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
okay well i'm glad you brought up risk

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,799
because i actually wanted to talk to you

116
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,519
a little bit more about that um

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,840
you know obviously the economy is in a

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,639
difficult place right now we've got

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,359
global inflation uh you know what are

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,040
you doing to mitigate that risk i know

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,560
you're you're speaking about a lot of

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,600
data but you know what else are you

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,360
doing to to mitigate the risk sure so

124
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,280
there's two sides for us there's the

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
borrower side and how we look at risk

126
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,079
there and then there's also how what

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
we're doing to

128
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,279
offset those costs on the investor side

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
or or the fund administration side so

130
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,439
for the borrower side

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,280
we want to underwrite each of these

132
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,759
transactions so we look at the real

133
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,839
estate as one part of the equation so we

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
call that the property company and then

135
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,439
we look at the op the cannabis business

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,079
side the prop or the the

137
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,000
the operating company and so for the

138
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,918
operating company when we look at these

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,279
transactions we want to look at their

140
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,839
make sure that they're an expert an

141
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,758
existing experienced operator we can't

142
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,000
afford to work with somebody that's just

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
getting in the industry it's it's too

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,478
complicated of an industry for us to

145
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,279
take that that risk or for our borrower

146
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,038
the property owner to take that risk

147
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,279
but the second thing is is for that real

148
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,240
estate it has to be specialty purpose

149
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,679
built for cannabis use and that requires

150
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,680
certain licensing

151
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,319
specific tenant improvements specific

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,478
equipment specific power specific water

153
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,759
all these things and so what we want to

154
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:42,159
do is we want to underwrite 100 of all

155
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,479
the costs that are necessary we can't

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,919
leave anything to to guess or

157
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,719
speculation

158
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,120
so when we do an an underwriting of a

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,199
transaction we want to understand what's

160
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,199
the total cost for the property purchase

161
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,879
what's the total construction cost or

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,120
tenant improvements and what is the

163
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,000
equipment that is necessary to get that

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,399
facility up and running we want to we

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,079
underwrite 100 of what the costs are

166
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,198
required to get that all the way to

167
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,839
being a cash flowing facility and then

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,080
from there we'll typically lend up to 60

169
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,399
of that so the borrowers need to know

170
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,159
that they need to come up with 40

171
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,719
but the difference between us and a

172
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,919
traditional bank and by the way we'll

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
talk about banking in a second in the

174
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,959
u.s

175
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,800
the difference with us is we're a cost

176
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,758
basis lender so we're going to look at

177
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,000
that 100 percent cost basis of all those

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,439
things the the acquisition costs the

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,038
tenant improvement construction and

180
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,600
equipment we're going to count that as

181
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,038
100 cost basis and we'll go up to 60 of

182
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,759
that whereas

183
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,918
banks or other lenders are only going to

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
look at the real estate value and

185
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,159
99 of all of them are going to look at

186
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,439
what's called the alternative use which

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,840
is not cannabis use and so that value is

188
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,478
probably going to be half of what the

189
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,159
valuation is so you're you might there

190
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,879
is traditional finance in the u.s

191
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,160
there's 704 depositor

192
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,800
fdic insured federal and state banks out

193
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
there there's four dozen banks that are

194
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,079
uh that are traditional banks that are

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,038
lending including ours in the united

196
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,318
states so

197
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,800
believe it or not

198
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
as much as you may hear differently

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,598
out of the 2000 transactions we've

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,519
looked at since 2014 we've never seen

201
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,680
one transaction that didn't have banking

202
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,359
in place if it did would be a massive

203
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,959
red flag to us so

204
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,038
there is banking out there it's

205
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,359
typically state banking any bank in the

206
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,038
us can accept cannabis deposits if they

207
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
wanted to they just don't have the

208
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,199
compliance to risk their their banking

209
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,478
license to accept that the banks that

210
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,160
are doing it they have their own

211
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,399
specific compliance department for each

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
state they're charging for that

213
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,478
that deposit so imagine paying money to

214
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
make a deposit it's usually point two

215
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,279
percent and they have higher banking

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
fees so

217
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,719
so there's those robust banking out

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,319
there um but um you know we we just we

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,319
just are trying to

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,520
basically all these cannabis operators

221
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,280
are entrepreneurs and we are our goal is

222
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,120
to take whatever equity that you've

223
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,038
raised and take it as far as you

224
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,598
possibly can because when you're doing

225
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,680
that initial equity raise it's the worst

226
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,918
possible valuation it's your lowest

227
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,918
valuation possible so we want to

228
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,439
minimize what equity you need to raise

229
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,598
and you want to come to us and

230
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,000
understand how much equity do i need to

231
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,120
raise so that i'm not raising selling

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,879
too much my company too early

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
uh well it sounds like your model is

234
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,639
working

235
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,320
uh you know i really appreciate all that

236
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,080
you've done to really help a lot of

237
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,760
these companies get a start because you

238
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
know it was so difficult in the

239
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,559
beginning to get investors or to get a

240
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,320
loan or to get banking and you know what

241
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,079
drew you into being one of the first

242
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,600
when when there wasn't really very many

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,360
people that were already doing it well i

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,519
i wish i had some awesome story um and

245
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,159
and some of our my my

246
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,039
partners uh we do have stories but for

247
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,120
us it was more um just that we had the

248
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,799
skill set to do

249
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,278
the the building and acquisition of

250
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,958
these types of properties and dana

251
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,759
roebacher is our friend and local

252
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,559
congressman in my my state

253
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,120
so that when that's passing when we

254
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,119
launched our fund he was he was on the

255
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,959
on the congress floor got calling in for

256
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,039
a live interview when we launched the

257
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,199
fund so that was that was kind of the

258
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,360
genesis for for us

259
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,080
but as we've been into it and get

260
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,159
further and further into it um we're

261
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,200
hearing and we're learning all these

262
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,278
stories and just as a kind of a metric

263
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
this is about a 50 billion dollar asset

264
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,360
class of real estate once it's built out

265
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,000
there's been about 3 billion put out of

266
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,240
that 3 billion we've done 435 million of

267
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,320
it so our facilities are generating

268
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,399
probably at least 2 billion worth of

269
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,519
revenue coming through the united states

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,000
each year and for me personally

271
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,399
the the fact that that that much

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
cannabis is being legally produced

273
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,559
some some of those people that are

274
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,760
purchasing that are not purchasing

275
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,759
opioids and for me even if it was just

276
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,759
one percent people are

277
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,078
that that five opiates are now

278
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,879
transitioning over and using a cannabis

279
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:16,000
instead that's a win for me um there's a

280
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,799
it's an enormous economic uh driver out

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,200
there it's a lot of jobs and as nick

282
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,120
said earlier you know it's it's it's

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,759
resilient to recession and economic

284
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,839
downturns and even during covid we were

285
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,600
deemed an essential business none of our

286
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
transactions had any distress during

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,278
that time that's that's fantastic well

288
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,199
thank you for everything you've done in

289
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,078
the united states now switching into the

290
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,839
european markets um you know this is a

291
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,838
really exciting time i'm curious what

292
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,160
kind of due diligence you're doing as

293
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,640
you prepare for a growing european

294
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,639
marketplace it's hard to do

295
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,720
due diligence from a

296
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:54,078
a debt perspective when you have no

297
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,360
rules so so we're we're here building

298
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:59,759
relationships trying to get a lay of the

299
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,519
land it takes time to

300
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,919
to understand these markets and how

301
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,120
they're emerging and and the underlying

302
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:10,159
things that that you don't see in the

303
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,200
uh pitch decks and the and the data sets

304
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,879
out there

305
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,278
perceptions and and how things will

306
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,360
really shake out sometimes takes time so

307
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,200
so for us it's just starting to build

308
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,278
those relationships starting to look at

309
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,759
transactions starting to run those

310
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,278
transactions through our modeling to see

311
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,039
okay this would me

312
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,519
this would all work here but what would

313
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,919
we need to solve for that so for a debt

314
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,600
provider we need to have attorneys that

315
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,519
are licensed in those states or those

316
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,839
countries we need to have right we need

317
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,480
to have relationships with regulators we

318
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,320
need to know what do we need to be able

319
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,399
to do in the event that we had to

320
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
foreclose on that facility and we're

321
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,159
going to be potentially directly in the

322
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
business ourselves and so we have to

323
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,879
think all those things all the way

324
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,560
through

325
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,159
my my job

326
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,078
at one point was i was worst case

327
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,399
scenario rob because i always had to be

328
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,479
the one that that broke the transaction

329
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,278
the models to see what are we going to

330
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,839
do in these worst case scenarios to make

331
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,720
sure that we can unwind that transaction

332
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,639
get it repositioned and it sold so

333
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,320
for us right now we're looking for our

334
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,839
third party service providers which

335
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
attorneys i earlier uh at the conference

336
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,040
this morning there was four attorneys up

337
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
here and two of them were our attorneys

338
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,599
so i thought that was pretty funny um

339
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,439
denton's and zuber um so

340
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,000
and but there's other things we need

341
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,760
construction consulting companies to run

342
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,480
our feasibility reviews

343
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,399
we need to have um you know who are we

344
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,759
going to be using for insurance there's

345
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,078
it's a little bit different nuance in

346
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,159
the uni in europe and united states in

347
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,638
the united states these traditional

348
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,679
third-party service providers errors and

349
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,480
admissions insurance property insurance

350
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,559
are it's federally illegal so there is

351
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,120
in any policy that you traditionally get

352
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,518
it says that it's null and void if you

353
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,679
break the law and so you you need to

354
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,519
make sure that you're uh in the united

355
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,838
states that you've got those carve outs

356
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,759
that they acknowledge that that as long

357
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,440
as it's legal in the state that you're

358
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,240
that the policy will still be enforced

359
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,680
so we have to understand how how

360
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,039
how these things are going to work and

361
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,799
and the biggest question i've been

362
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,399
asking some of my some of the people

363
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,759
i've been been speaking with already at

364
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
this conference and the one previously

365
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,039
is

366
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,039
i personally and all of our team really

367
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,039
needs to get comfortable with you know

368
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,120
these these facilities and we only do

369
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,639
indoor facilities we

370
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,039
production facilities we don't do any

371
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,360
agricultural deals so that's a farming

372
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,919
lender and that's not what we are so

373
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
we'll only be doing cultivation testing

374
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,198
distribution dispensaries things like

375
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,479
that and we we need to understand we

376
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,559
know how much it costs to build these

377
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,759
facilities we've seen these facilities

378
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:48,000
and when you're putting out 10 20 50 100

379
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,879
million dollars into a facility that is

380
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,399
an enormous capex expense how are you

381
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,439
going to re

382
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,440
re recover that capex and be profitable

383
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,560
when you can import from

384
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,120
countries that have lower capex and opex

385
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,638
costs and i just that's that's the

386
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,278
biggest one we're struggling with right

387
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,600
now and it's not that it's it's that

388
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,399
it's uh unsolvable we just need to

389
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,240
understand how we get comfortable with

390
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,600
that because if we can't get comfortable

391
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
with it we certainly aren't going to be

392
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
able to

393
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,680
uh get it get our investors comfortable

394
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,480
with it oh yeah that's for sure now

395
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,559
i'm also really curious as this market

396
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,000
blows up and and how that relates to the

397
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,319
u.s market on the u.s federal uh time

398
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,720
frame for rescheduling what that might

399
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,480
do for interstate and international

400
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,000
trade and if you're looking at that as a

401
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,759
as a way to gauge how you're going to

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,720
enter this marketplace

403
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,958
so

404
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,839
in the united states uh for the my

405
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:50,559
political prognostication is is that

406
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,600
there's there's always a push to get

407
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,119
the next bill through the house and our

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,959
it's the senate you need to get through

409
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,919
and to get 60 votes in the senate means

410
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,159
you're going to need 10 republicans and

411
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,479
there's actually 17 republicans that are

412
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,799
identified as being pro-cannabis but

413
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,959
they're not pro-cannabis when you throw

414
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,278
every single thing that the democrats

415
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:14,078
want and the democrats are not going to

416
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,559
let their trophy piece of of of what

417
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,759
they run on go through unless they get

418
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,078
social justice reform and social equity

419
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,519
components put in there and i think that

420
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,439
the republicans and i think the whole

421
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,679
industry is okay with that but the the

422
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,240
democrats problem is they always go

423
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,319
so far overboard that you can't keep the

424
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,320
republicans on board so

425
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,639
that i i don't see any

426
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,320
i my prognostication is it's going to be

427
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,839
in the next administration whether it's

428
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,278
republican or democrat at best and

429
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,600
that they're not going to see any

430
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,720
meaningful reform in the united states

431
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,879
and

432
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,360
eventually we do see it being

433
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,838
deconflicted from from federal policy or

434
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,079
federally legalized but even if that

435
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,160
happens i don't

436
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,638
i don't think that the united states is

437
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,600
going to allow importation if it becomes

438
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,600
federally legal and you know true leave

439
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,680
is betting that it will be x be able to

440
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,159
be exported they have one of the most

441
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,159
advanced facilities in in the world in

442
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,559
southern florida or sorry just in

443
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,719
florida and that facility is being built

444
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,278
to gmp certification so that they could

445
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,519
potentially out uh you know

446
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,000
ship it internationally

447
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,839
it's just going to be interesting to see

448
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
i do think that there'll be some

449
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,399
compacts put together between states

450
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,919
that you can cross state lines but

451
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,159
right now i think it's just going to be

452
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,159
the status quo and the further

453
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,000
it gets down the line like in the united

454
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,919
states where you're 38 states with

455
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,320
separate uh compliance for every single

456
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,479
state the harder it is to wind all that

457
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,959
back in and make it under one compliant

458
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,759
package i just i don't see it we

459
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,719
yeah so well all right well that's

460
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,399
that's

461
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
you know a lot to think about obviously

462
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,120
i'm thinking of the importing and

463
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,278
exporting and a lot of international

464
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,839
trade um we'll look forward to that in

465
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,198
the meantime you know there's probably a

466
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,680
lot to be said about how you're going to

467
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,038
be investing from other countries that

468
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,599
are going to be doing trade before we

469
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,959
get a chance to do that ourselves with

470
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,639
uh with europe in america um but since

471
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,558
we have only just a few minutes left i

472
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,759
wanted to just first ask you one last

473
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,359
question and then open it up to the

474
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,558
floor to see if anybody else has any

475
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,678
questions

476
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,759
for any

477
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,439
new entrepreneurs or investors that are

478
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,959
just getting into the industry what

479
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
advice would you give them

480
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,558
so

481
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,160
we had a lot of investors and raised a

482
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,240
lot of capital when we entered the

483
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,160
cannabis space i had the mistake of

484
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,640
thinking that you know we would be able

485
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,480
to use those same investors to to go

486
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,880
down this this direction

487
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,200
and that wasn't the case at all

488
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,440
and the opportunity

489
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,960
was passing us by and we were not able

490
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,679
to uh lend for 24 for two years

491
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,160
and so i've tried all kinds of different

492
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,400
strategies so i've been on the same side

493
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,798
as as many of these entrepreneurs

494
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,559
as this market has emerged it's a little

495
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,558
bit easier for us to raise debt than

496
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,759
than you guys because we have a secured

497
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:08,558
asset but there's not the upside either

498
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,440
um and so if i could give a

499
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,399
super

500
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,720
massive piece of advice is

501
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,960
you always hear try to get you know as

502
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,919
few investors as possible and as big a

503
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,880
checks as you can but in reality

504
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,200
nobody

505
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,080
that's a very difficult proposition and

506
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,000
so what i would tell people is don't go

507
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,439
the traditional way of of trying to

508
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,279
raise capital try to have the the lowest

509
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,360
entry point or the lowest size check

510
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,160
writer in the and the most amount of

511
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,319
investors because raising money at five

512
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,759
twenty five thousand dollars at a time

513
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,798
is going to get you further down the

514
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,599
line than waiting for guys at 100 000 or

515
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,558
250 or a million at a time and you need

516
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,599
that basis of capital to get the bigger

517
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,639
check riders so just just when you start

518
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,839
thinking about how you're going to do

519
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,720
your raise think about your your

520
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,839
securities offering or your structuring

521
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,440
or your how your the the third parties

522
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,279
that you're going to use to manage your

523
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,919
investors in the united states that

524
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:13,279
might be k1s or investor portals just

525
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,080
think about using third-party facility

526
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,079
third parties that can facilitate a way

527
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,399
higher the maximum amount of investors

528
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,079
that you possibly can and minimize those

529
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,798
those investment amounts

530
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,798
it's better to have uh to have capital

531
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,639
flowing in all the time than keep

532
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,240
talking to people and they're they're

533
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,160
thinking about it you need those checks

534
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,279
flowing in all the time and so we

535
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,880
switched to retail investors in 2016 and

536
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,599
today we have about a thousand and

537
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,679
eighty of those so our fund is is

538
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,918
currently about 303 million assets in

539
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,320
our management and it's compromised

540
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,799
it's con consists of probably at least

541
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,918
95 it might be 98

542
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:55,119
of individuals and so an individual is

543
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,440
going to be able to give you a decision

544
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,359
within a day or two because they're

545
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,200
their own credit committee when you

546
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,119
start going to funds when you start

547
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,519
going to institutional investors when

548
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,959
you start going to these other people

549
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,200
you lost that that direct connection to

550
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
the person making the decision of being

551
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,798
able to pitch your story and answer

552
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,039
those questions that they might have

553
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,359
when you tell somebody and they go to

554
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,640
tell your story to a credit committee in

555
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,599
cannabis

556
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,759
good frickin luck trust me

557
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,599
i mean we have four years of audited

558
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,919
returns we're investment grade rated we

559
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,158
have institutional investors and

560
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,080
still it's it's enormously and

561
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,679
challenging and i have a lot easier than

562
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,639
most people are because of the history

563
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:43,120
we have so that would be my my primary

564
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,520
advice and and another thing too is that

565
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,519
it you should be using data and facts to

566
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,240
educate them the investment should sell

567
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,279
itself it's not about sales it's just

568
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,079
about giving it educating them letting

569
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,000
them know um you know what

570
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,599
what what this is going to do and this

571
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,679
is why this is how we're supporting

572
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,158
these facts based on the information we

573
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,000
know today and that event information in

574
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,000
facts is going to continue to evolve and

575
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,319
change and that's okay but as long as

576
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,400
you're using facts to back that up

577
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,639
great great that's great advice did

578
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,559

thank you as a um a u.s multi-state

598
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
operator um i'm

599
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,679
thinking about coming into the european

600
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,319
markets so do you write underwrite in

601
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,000
the european markets currently and then

602
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,240
the second part of my question is going

603
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,720
back to the u.s markets how do you feel

604
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,720
about the opportunity zones and is that

605
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,759
an area of development within your own

606
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,480
business

607
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,440
great so the first one is

608
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,880
we are looking at preliminarily looking

609
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,720
at transactions here in in europe in in

610
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,919
foreign countries

611
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,480
if we if we land on a on a transaction

612
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,799
that that meets all of our our metrics

613
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,279
that we've established in the u.s

614
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,960
and then we can get past answering some

615
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,558
of the compliance or the uh the the the

616
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,558
the underlying questions that we're not

617
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,279
sure of we're willing to come here to

618
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,599
you to we're willing to lend the next

619
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,158
part is our fund is only authorized to

620
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,839
lend within the united states so then we

621
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,080
have to decide are we going to do us

622
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,359
stand-alone transactions or launch a

623
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,359
fund here

624
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,959
right at this point there's not enough

625
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,359
business for us to launch a half a

626
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,798
billion dollar fund here there's it just

627
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,798
doesn't make sense we would have dead

628
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,038
capital so we'll probably aggregate a

629
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,960
few transactions and then assign those

630
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,879
into our funds in the next three to five

631
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,480
years something like that but we're here

632
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,960
early to get an understanding and build

633
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,720
these relationships today as it relates

634
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,960
back to the united states and

635
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,038
opportunity zones and opportunity zones

636
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,038
in the in the united states is just a

637
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:31,919
zone where you have really beneficial

638
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:33,440
tax

639
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,720
structures and

640
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,679
we are just a lender so we don't own the

641
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,278
property so the owner of the property is

642
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,559
the one that would benefit from the

643
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,278
opportunity zone not us as the lender

644
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,000
but

645
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,319
as we do have our own division we do own

646
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
lots of projects we have a whole

647
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,678
separate division the company that

648
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,080
entitles stuff

649
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,240
entitles projects for cannabis and that

650
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,558
builds relationships with with the

651
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,720
cities so that we can

652
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,000
take advantage of those so we are and

653
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
we'll probably launch a fund in the

654
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,079
united states that is not an opportun

655
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,278
opportune zone focused fund but we're we

656
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,359
believe that there'll be some

657
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,079
repositioning of distressed transactions

658
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,399
in the u.s in the next 12 to 24 months

659
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,399
and so we're positioned to to

660
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,798
reposition those assets with that that

661
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,200
fund a great question

662
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,798
