1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
I do appreciate your company and that

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,778
you're joining me here and for this very

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,279
short presentation I want to say right

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,439
up front you need to know my background

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,660
I I have been in this industry for two

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,480
years I joined brains bicycle two years

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,399
ago prior to that I was a pharmaceutical

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,320
executive so I was a senior vice

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,839
president for a biotech company called

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,579
Biogen in the USA I managed their

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,339
neurology business about seven billion

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,198
dollars worth of business and then prior

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,359
to that I was the managing director in

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,399
the UK and Ireland and for the same

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,500
company and I was also the chairman of

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,079
the industry group so I worked with

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,600
um the Prime Minister and and the

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,219
industry I was the industry chair and

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,260
for the group to try and bring about

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,420
health care reform so this just played

21
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,519
right into that in terms of developing

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,100
the science and also changing the

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,440
political landscape for us to be make

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,300
sure that patients get access to these

25
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,979
incredible treatments

26
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,538
so what I want to do is to just start

27
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,359
for those of you who don't know brains

28
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,219
biosutical and we are an evidence-based

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,899
and a science-led company all right and

30
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,460
so for me that is quite critical knowing

31
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,640
my background you know I'm not surprised

32
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,559
by that and you know we we are an API

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
producer one of the parts of our

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,000
businesses we produce API

35
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,618
um and the reason for that is that we

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,079
want to make sure that scientific

37
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,759
studies are not compromised because of

38
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,280
inconsistency

39
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,799
um within the API or that they meet the

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,500
criteria that is required

41
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,299
um for for a clinical study which is GMP

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,040
and you've got to have a DMF and all of

43
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,618
those type of things that is so

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,420
important because you know I I I get

45
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,459
saddened and I'm sure some of you will

46
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,859
be able to relate to this how many

47
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:44,879
failed studies are emerging at the

48
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,978
moment and that it's failing not because

49
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,438
um the the drugs don't work not because

50
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,299
cannabis or the cannabinoids don't have

51
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,798
a role to play in treating some of these

52
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,140
diseases it's failing because the

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,939
studies are poorly designed or because

54
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,618
we haven't done

55
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,179
um double randomized perceiver

56
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,759
controlled studies you know so people

57
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,320
can compare and what the true benefit is

58
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,459
so

59
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,859
um yeah

60
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,139
I'm excited about this space as as

61
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,060
somebody in this industry

62
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,859
um I've I've researched the data before

63
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,780
coming into the sector thank you for

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,760
welcoming me in

65
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,140
um and you know what you see over and

66
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,479
over again these are two Landmark

67
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:25,019
studies that were done reviews and one

68
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,119
by the NIH and in the U.S in the USA

69
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,640
um and the other ones here in the UK but

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,259
the conclusion was the same if we could

71
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,359
learn how to modulate the

72
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:36,419
endocannabinoid system we could

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,640
potentially find solutions for every

74
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,079
major disease that humans are facing at

75
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,759
the moment

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,040
the other thing that we're starting to

77
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,219
see is that there is the emergence of

78
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,519
really exciting new targets and so we

79
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,800
tend to think of of cannabis or

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,439
cannabinoids in in the realm of CB1 and

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
CB2 receptors but I'm also really

82
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,280
excited about the fact that it works on

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,560
other Pathways why is that important if

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,039
you look at migraine for example we know

85
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,900
that CBD works on your yours your CV

86
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,179
receptors but it also works on your

87
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,459
calcitonin Gene related peptide pathway

88
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,200
now that could that that's where all

89
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,420
your triptans work at the moment so if

90
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,579
you have something that works on two

91
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,679
major Pathways potentially you could

92
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,200
have something that is more beneficial

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
than what is currently available or you

94
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,799
could have something for those that

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,158
aren't responding to triptans that could

96
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,659
benefit from Cannabis based or

97
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,699
cannabinoid-based treatment so really

98
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:35,219
excited about that

99
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,199
however the reality is there's only

100
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,060
three approved drugs on the market so a

101
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,859
lot of activity in the space that you

102
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,840
know clinicaltrial.gov there's over a

103
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,459
thousand clinical studies there but I

104
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,158
think we as an industry need to

105
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,259
potentially do better and I know that a

106
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,239
lot of you are in the area of medical

107
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,519
cannabis I'm really grateful for that

108
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,180
but you know medical cannabis at the

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,039
moment my home country which is the UK

110
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,599
um you know at the moment only about one

111
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,298
percent of patients that could benefit

112
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,699
from medical cannabis or cannabis or

113
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,640
cannabinoid type treatments are getting

114
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,899
access to it why it is so difficult you

115
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,458
know you've got to be a specialist

116
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,500
you've got to have a license you've got

117
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,819
to be certified you've got to have all

118
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,000
of these things and every single country

119
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,459
is different but there's still a a lot

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,680
of hurdles that one has to go through in

121
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,439
order to give patients access to this so

122
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,840
be serious about giving patients X to it

123
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,759
then you know Insanity tells me that

124
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,319
doing the same thing but expecting a

125
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,259
different result is a little bit

126
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:37,019
ludicrous so that's why we're trying A

127
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,120
New Path at brains biosutical and you

128
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:42,180
know what we're trying to do is to to

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,978
really look at drug development you know

130
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,900
I I've come from as I said from a

131
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,699
pharmaceutical background so if you

132
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,560
can't change the rules played by the

133
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,620
rules that's that's what I sort of say

134
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,079
and um and we are looking at at all

135
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,478
elements of due diligence in terms of

136
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,120
developing product for this market so

137
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,740
you know starting with good API as I

138
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,199
said you've got to show something that

139
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,939
that any treatment that you bring to the

140
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,919
market has to be better than the current

141
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,779
standard of care it's got to be

142
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,159
commercially viable so you know if

143
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,439
you're comparing yourself to a

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,240
genericized market it most probably

145
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,978
isn't going to be worth the investment

146
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,199
you've got to formulate it because

147
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,360
patents are so important in the

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
pharmaceutical industry if people are

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,800
going to invest Millions into that and

150
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,478
then design the studies properly so that

151
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,400
you can have measurable outcomes and

152
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,038
measurable endpoints

153
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,138
so just a little bit about about that

154
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,060
you know this is just an example this is

155
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,100
not an advertisement for brains but just

156
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,100
the length that we need to go to in

157
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,600
order to pursue this path so the very

158
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,600
first thing is you've got to make sure

159
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,419
that you meet all the specs of rchq7 and

160
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,840
you can see that as an example our CBD

161
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:54,799
98 to 102 the impurity levels are less

162
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,619
than 0.15 THC is undetectable

163
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,120
0.000 and a four percent

164
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,639
um you've got to have consistency you've

165
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,439
got to be compliant with rchq 7 you've

166
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,120
got to be compliant with the journal

167
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,879
from a German pharmacopoeia you could

168
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,538
have stability data toxicologists data

169
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,038
we've got all of that all right and over

170
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,719
and above that you've got to walk the

171
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:17,279
talk you've got to do the studies and

172
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,979
you've got to have we've got to drug

173
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,619
Master file and we also got an r d

174
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:25,800
element so we're looking at THC Delta 9

175
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,780
we're looking at CBN and CVG why because

176
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,060
that review paper that I showed you

177
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,679
that's where the Sciences go at the

178
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,079
moment those are the cannabinoids that

179
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,079
that scientists and researchers are

180
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,758
looking at and I think part of you know

181
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,038
where the industry is going is

182
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,740
potentially being able to to bring

183
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,659
different cannabinoids together and to

184
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,660
formulate them in a way so you know we

185
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,120
know that CV CBD work together with CVN

186
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,919
is better than any of those two agents

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,959
on their own for things like anxiety and

188
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,758
insomnia so you know being able to

189
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,978
combine them so take the US let's

190
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,780
combine them and reformulate them as a

191
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:03,719
key step in where we're going

192
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:06,179
we've just enlarged our facility so that

193
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,639
um the No No Surprise our facility is

194
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,160
the old FASA facility in the UK in

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
Sandwich so um you know once again the

196
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,460
pharmaceutical connection we've just

197
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,258
enlarged it to make sure that we can

198
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,839
meet demand for both today and tomorrow

199
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,660
because so many studies as they progress

200
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,638
into phase three and the voism volumes

201
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,500
increase people can't meet those

202
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,079
increased in demand so we wanted to make

203
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,139
sure we were ready for that and then we

204
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,598
are in partnership with DSM femini which

205
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,060
is a a world leader pharmaceutical

206
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,519
company in the area of formulation and

207
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,379
why that is important is we know that

208
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,959
cannabinoids are broken down with your

209
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,060
first pass metabolism and so you know

210
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,418
the bioavailability of cannabinoids is

211
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,339
is low and so we need to make sure that

212
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:51,839
that we can formulate these drugs in

213
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,359
different ways that we can increase the

214
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,219
loading increase the stability as well

215
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,620
as increase the bioavailability so we're

216
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,240
doing that together with our partners

217
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,639
and um

218
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,460
you know then the next step is for us to

219
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,319
make sure that we that we we do the

220
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,698
clinical studies and I just wanted to

221
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,740
leave you with this one little thing so

222
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,319
this is one of our partners that we are

223
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,300
supporting in Philadelphia and this was

224
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,500
a study that's pre-cleaned so you know

225
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,840
Please be aware that it's as

226
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,660
pre-clinical not clinical but you know

227
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,399
this excites me you know and this is one

228
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,400
of the leading causes of death if you've

229
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:29,219
got cancer melanoma and the other one is

230
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,439
in lung cancer the other you know in the

231
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,080
top three causes of death if you get

232
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,620
these forms of cancer and the fact that

233
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,620
CBD that this is an Ana formulation has

234
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,560
been shown to reduce tumors in in this

235
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,019
in this in this cancer and as well as

236
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,500
prolonged love is is incredibly exciting

237
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,600
these are powerful Therapeutics and I'm

238
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,539
absolutely privileged to be part of this

239
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,459
you know and actually the the you know I

240
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,019
love that last question like Terry why

241
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,819
did you join this industry and why are

242
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,519
you doing what you're doing and I think

243
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,140
for me you know it's all about that we

244
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,179
leave the world in a better place that

245
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,699
you know because of our presence that

246
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:11,219
we're making things better and even once

247
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,140
we've moved on into other things that

248
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,540
that impact loss and yet you know I

249
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,639
think one of the speakers said you guys

250
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,819
are changing the landscape you guys are

251
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,860
game changers history makers and and I'm

252
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,440
really grateful to be part of this group

253
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,300
as we go and navigate and Pioneer this

254
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,399
new area and make a difference in the

255
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,240
world particularly for patients so thank

256
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:37,339
you for your time

257
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:39,480
[Applause]

258
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:43,380
there you go

259
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,379
is there a question yeah

260
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,060
yeah yeah yeah

261
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,580
sure

262
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,559
okay so so the question is do we do

263
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,019
asset forms and do we do them in a

264
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,939
formulation that is stabilized so once

265
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,278
again the research is really excited to

266
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,100
run some of the asset forms all right at

267
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,259
this current stage we don't would I like

268
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,519
to get into that area absolutely and I

269
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,458
think you raise a good point because

270
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,500
what I would love to see is rather than

271
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,000
you know the football analogy I I don't

272
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,919
know for those of you when my kids were

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,659
younger you know it used to be so much

274
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,458
fun watching them play football or

275
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,919
soccer or whatever you know because they

276
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,899
would all run after the ball you know no

277
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,699
one's played in position everybody ran

278
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,919
off to the ball and I think so we as a

279
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,500
company as an industry have to get

280
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,259
better at not all running after the same

281
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,179
Ball but complementing each other so we

282
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,220
don't do asset forms but potentially

283
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,559
somebody out there does do asset forms

284
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,240
so let's work together you know rather

285
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,879
than I saw chasing the same Ball but

286
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,339
great question thank you yes sir so um

287
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,860
Bo Whitney Whitney economics

288
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,940
um in the United States the largest

289
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,519
contributor to anti-cannabis reform

290
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:03,600
legislation is Big Pharma yeah

291
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,220
um in I recently spoke at the parliament

292
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,180
in Ireland

293
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:12,899
um huge Pharma presence the doctors are

294
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:15,179
that the medical program is fledgling

295
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,200
because of the influence of big Pharma

296
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,778
yeah

297
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,000
um how can

298
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:24,179
one question is why is Big Pharma so

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,100
afraid of and you know we all know that

300
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,479
this question why is it so afraid of

301
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,839
cannabis but

302
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,100
how can the Cannabis industry

303
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:38,640
kind of work with big Pharma to develop

304
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,920
stuff in parallel rather than being

305
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,740
assumed to be a threat to the big Pharma

306
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,240
industry well okay so I'm going to

307
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,930
answer that question in the next 30

308
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,539
minutes

309
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:51,299
[Laughter]

310
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,939
um you know what the short answer is Big

311
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:57,240
Pharma want to know two things is it

312
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,399
safe and number two show me the evidence

313
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,778
and I think that's exactly what I was

314
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,339
talking about now we can maybe get into

315
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,559
it in a little bit more detail in the

316
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,959
panel to conversation but I think at the

317
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,259
moment rather than doing signaling

318
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,299
studies or proof of concept studies or

319
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,338
um you know trying to trying to trying

320
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,439
to do real world evidence Pharma doesn't

321
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,200
get engaged on that they get engaged

322
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,480
when you've got a solid pre-clean or

323
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,399
phase one phase two clinical study the

324
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,159
evidence is there it's shown to have a

325
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,879
benefit over Placebo or other current

326
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,039
form so I think for me you know I I'm

327
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,899
very comfortable with the fact that that

328
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,599
people need access to these medicines

329
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,720
now so that's where the medical cannabis

330
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,540
per se is playing a role but if we want

331
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,600
to if we want to engage farmer and and a

332
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:48,000
broader populace of patients then some

333
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,860
of us have to start going and it's a

334
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,200
it's a journey you know we know it takes

335
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,079
about 10 years from molecule development

336
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,600
through to to an MMA a marketing

337
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,578
authorization but what I would say is we

338
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,159
don't have to start even at drug

339
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,078
Discovery anymore because there's so

340
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,278
much evidence somebody asked me today

341
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,199
they said Terry what do you think of

342
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,419
real world evidence and I said to them

343
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,079
real world evidence in my old world

344
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:15,240
never replaces a pivotal clinical study

345
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,159
but no clinical study should start

346
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,019
without real world evidence because you

347
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,059
want to minimize as much risk as you can

348
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,399
so I think it's complementary but I

349
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,319
think big Pharma will get involved when

350
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,179
we start to do the studies that show

351
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,800
them that these are powerful

352
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,859
Therapeutics and their pipelines are

353
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,599
drying up you know so you you know I

354
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,639
think they're waiting for us as an

355
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,399
industry to up our game and do some of

356
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,919
these studies thank you so much I was

357
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
perfect

358
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,509
oh yeah no that's okay everybody's ready

359
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,658
one more time for Terry o'rigan

360
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:48,658
[Applause]
