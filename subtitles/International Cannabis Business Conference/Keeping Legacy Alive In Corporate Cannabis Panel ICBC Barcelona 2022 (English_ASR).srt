at least the jamaican rastafarian

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,680
culture back in the 1850s and 1860s

92
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,119
really kind of bringing it to the fold

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,158

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,959
terms of how the legacy market is being

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,799
impacted as legalization is becoming

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560

118
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,318
really you know have been watching the

119
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
industry

120
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,879
really from a very u.s center you know

121
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,798
focus as leading the u.s trade

122
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,279
association so i'm not going to speak

123
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,560
for europe but what we see is that you

124
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,159
know as we've

125
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
we have done a really great job of

126
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,639
moving public opinion in the right

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,280
direction away from prohibition you know

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,759
switching state laws over and over and

129
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,959
over into 37 states of medical 18 with

130
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,600
adult use

131
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,120
um but you know the good good side of

132
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
that is that means less there are less

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,959
arrests but on this on the flip side uh

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,520
we have not done enough to create

135
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,478
regulatory regimes that are accessible

136
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,319
to

137
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,240
minority-owned businesses

138
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,719
um other you know small mom-and-pop

139
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,800
operators uh who who

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,800
were at one time legacy operators

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,360
meaning they were operating in the

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,199
previously unregulated market

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,919
and so we need to be doing a lot more

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
both at the federal state and local

145
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,519
level

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,120
in the u.s to open up these markets to

147
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,560
everybody

148
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
julia what do you think about that in

149
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,360
terms of impacting the legacy market

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,879
being impacted by legalization

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,038
i was born and raised in northern

152
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,839
california i was in middle school in

153
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,120
1996 when prop 215 was passed so

154
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,359
cannabis was everywhere i never

155
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,439
considered it a drug so for me my entire

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,800
community and my perspective

157
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,959
is that it's medicine i've been a

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
patient since you could be a patient

159
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,079
i've been selling it smoking it and

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,918
growing it my entire life it put me

161
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,519
through grad school and it's brought me

162
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,279
where i am today so to see the

163
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,120
extinction event happen to a lot of the

164
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,119
legacy farmers that

165
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
weren't considered during the regulatory

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,720
process and were left out as aaron's

167
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
mentioning it's

168
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,840
when i used the word extinction event i

169
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
mean that in the literal economic term

170
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,359
and there's been multiple of them so i

171
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,280
would say maybe 90 of the people that we

172
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
used to work with before it was made

173
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,439
legal a few years ago are no longer in

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
business for various reasons of course

175
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,319
everyone knows that capitalism is

176
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,360
in a lot of ways a game of greed if it's

177
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,360
not conscious capitalism it's kind of

178
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,759
got a predatory perspective and

179
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
unfortunately with capital you have more

180
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,879
more play in this space and so a lot of

181
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,560
our job is to make sure that these

182
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,719
things are not lost and we say grounded

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,959
in our roots whether it's as frenchy

184
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,039
cannoli says the terroir of the place so

185
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,719
in northern california we have a very

186
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,478
special mediterranean-type climate that

187
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
grows a specific kind of cannabis with

188
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,519
certain cannabinoids and terpenes and

189
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,680
profile that is really rich and it's you

190
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,918
know we were proud of that heritage and

191
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,079
so to lose that from just making

192
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,240
something that's a magical mystical

193
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,000
medicinal plant and do a typical

194
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,519
consumer package good there's something

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
lost there and we're here to really just

196
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,719
remind that there has to be some purpose

197
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,319
and um respect for this plant and the

198
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,319
plant medicine and everything we do and

199
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,080
not just treat it like it's another

200
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,680
consumer good because it's really not it

201
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,279
needs to be treated in a special way or

202
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,879
else we're going to destroy it yeah

203
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,399
right on and so like you know that's

204
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,159
really really important you know because

205
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,079
the fact of the matter is it comes from

206
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,120
the culture you know this is the folks

207
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,719
that built this industry right so having

208
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
to be able to resonate with that is

209
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
super super important in the way she's

210
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
talking about i mean wouldn't you agree

211
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,198
needy i mean tell us a little bit about

212
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,439
what you think absolutely i i run a

213
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,598
brand uh based in california so like

214
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,439
luna you know my perspective is very

215
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,759
california centric

216
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,000
and you know we're watching the

217
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,240
cultivators loon supports craft

218
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,079
cultivators we really they can make not

219
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
just a concerted effort but it's part of

220
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,399
our ethos to

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
buy flower from small farmers that they

222
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,719
are getting pummeled right now as we're

223
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,598
seeing you know the big corporate grows

224
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,720
come online the economy of growing is

225
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,038
upside down in california it costs 700 a

226
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,160
pound to grow and cultivate the market's

227
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:55,279
at 300. so you know in

228
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,680
2022 we're hearing about farmers killing

229
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,038
themselves every day in california it is

230
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,639
an extremely volatile moment and you

231
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,560
know there's a lot that the newer

232
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,960
markets can learn from this there's it's

233
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,519
it's it's really unbelievable because

234
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,519
you know the thing to really focus on

235
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,959
for all of us here interested in this

236
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,038
business is

237
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,038
the best behaved part of the supply

238
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,719
chain is the consumer a lot of the

239
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,519
problems we have in this industry are

240
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
man-made we can control and do things

241
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,038
differently so you know i would say

242
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,918
that's that's the big thing that we're

243
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,598
seeing at loon right on india very very

244
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,598
well familiar with the california market

245
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,360
but learning from the california market

246
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,598
is very very important when we take it

247
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,918
all the way across the world over to a

248
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,440
place like germany lisa give us your

249
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,278
thoughts on some of that

250
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
well i think in general it is very

251
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,480
important that we learn from each other

252
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,720
and that we

253
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
trying not to only create these local

254
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
markets i mean if you look at europe for

255
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,599
example there are individual zones like

256
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,239
you know from the states and i think in

257
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,159
the end it should all be that we are

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,399
more connected and that we are lobbying

259
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,639
also for changes in global drug policy

260
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,278
that we can create a global cannabis

261
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,919
industry where it is not only like

262
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,838
individual markets where you then see

263
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,360
these effects like these price drops

264
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
weigh more

265
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
than than if you have a harmonized

266
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,320
system where you can

267
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
where you can

268
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,080
trade and you can exchange products and

269
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,240
they're not only stuck in their local

270
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,839
markets but i think it's very important

271
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,839
with the countries that are a little bit

272
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,800
further ahead that we learn from them

273
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,600
that we as entrepreneurs exchange and um

274
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,759
yeah just learn from the mistakes also

275
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560
that happened in other more further

276
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,080
developed areas yeah so these folks i

277
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,559
mean you understand that they've been

278
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,040
traumatized in a way multi-generational

279
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,278
farmers who have known just this is the

280
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,000
way they need to operate and education

281
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,600
is so important to help bridge the gap

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,480
and create that conduit between your

283
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,159
business

284
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
and the consumer right so i'd like to

285
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,439
actually roll that into this next

286
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,879
question which is you know since each of

287
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,360
you guys you know someone have a little

288
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,799
bit different of businesses um how are

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,639
you how are you guys you know tell our

290
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,639
audience actually how your business in

291
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,958
general is currently connecting with

292
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,879
consumers at that level that resonates

293
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,479
with industry culture

294
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,679
you want to go uh luna you want to try

295
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
it out

296
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:18,159
well we do dope hardware we lean hard

297
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,278
into the concept that this is um a

298
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:24,000
beautiful high-end luxury lifestyle it's

299
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,240
not just for losers and stoners and lazy

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,919
people we have dab rigs that are

301
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,839
induction heating that are really high

302
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,439
in technology but still are a nod to the

303
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,440
old school dab culture if you don't know

304
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
what dabbing is it's high temperature

305
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
vaporization through something like a

306
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,719
bong but it's specifically for

307
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,959
concentrated thc or any concentrated

308
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,240
cannabinoid really um for usually for

309
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,838
people who have a really high tolerance

310
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,159
and they want a lot of thc or they want

311
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,079
to have a custom experience so for us

312
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,838
we're able to have you know bring

313
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,278
technology and innovation into a space

314
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,640
that really hasn't had much innovation

315
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,919
people are still using the same pipes

316
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,838
and joints that they've been using for

317
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,159
you know 40 to 100 years however you

318
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,839
know apples or whatever you find so for

319
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,559
us we're really trying to be

320
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,959
sophisticated and polished and show the

321
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,439
the cannabis consumer and to normalize

322
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,879
it culturally um and also to investors

323
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,120
or to people who are on the fence about

324
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,879
it to legitimize it as this business but

325
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,320
also not leave people behind there's a

326
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,320
lot of brands that will brand themselves

327
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
like as anti-stoner and they put that

328
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,800
down to define themselves we're not

329
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,399

people what they need and it's actually

337
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,240
a form of like love and respect and flow

338
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,000
and you're the hook and so we we we wear

339
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,519
that to show that whatever you need we

340
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
got you on that whether it's policy

341
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,759
whether it's parties whether it's

342
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,680
culture whether it's dab rigs vape pens

343
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,639
it doesn't really matter where you're at

344
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,000
if

345
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,759
you're you know contributing to the

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,679
normalization of this plant that's what

347
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,679
we're all about we have you know we

348
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,199
always focus on hiring women people of

349
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,638
color trying to incorporate as many

350
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,160
folks as we can

351
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,560
when we partner with people we give

352
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,838
preferential attention and support to

353
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,000
people that have marginalized

354
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,240
backgrounds queer folks people who are

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,159
giving back to non-profits so we do a

356
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,799
lot of corporate social responsibility

357
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,719
work we do uh beach cleanups and we give

358
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,319
back where we can because if you're not

359
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,920
giving you really shouldn't be in this

360
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,519
space this plant is giving in its nature

361
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,278
great that's awesome and then i would

362
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,799
love to actually jump to you lisa with

363
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,799
mj universe

364
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,078
which is a platform that's providing

365
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,319
access to experts and again education is

366
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,319
key here right so tell us lisa how are

367
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,800
you how are you guys bridging that gap

368
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,519
well for us it's all about

369
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,359
yeah explaining cannabis to mainstream

370
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
businesses also a lot of my clients for

371
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
example are pharmaceutical companies

372
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,120
they don't know anything about cannabis

373
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,959
so you really start from scratch about

374
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,679
explaining what the plant does about the

375
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,439
contents and bringing across

376
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,159
this potential of cannabis to

377
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
conventional industries that exist but

378
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,600
like if you talk about this donor

379
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,319
stereotype for example i think this is

380
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,800
often also abused in certain ways

381
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,800
because we for example in germany we

382
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,519
just had a raid in a supermarket they

383
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,559
had a promotion for hemp products but it

384
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,240
was all labeled as hash brownies and all

385
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,078
these kind of things it had little rasta

386
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,039
people on it which is like really like i

387
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,638
don't know

388
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,159
not acceptable exactly and in the end it

389
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,240
was all about ham products and they

390
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,399
didn't make use of this vest potential

391
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,799
that is in the hemp nutrition that they

392
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,360
could have used easily but they decided

393
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,519
to take this donor stereotype make it a

394
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,360
red yellow green and then put a raster

395
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,198
man on it which is really a lot of

396
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,639
cultural appropriate appropriation also

397
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,879
that's yeah that raid was unfortunate

398
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,560
um so needy tell us a little bit about

399
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,159
how your products are connecting with

400
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,278
consumers your business in general is

401
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
connecting with consumers in the

402
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,240
california market

403
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,879
how's it going

404
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,519
yeah this is everything that we think

405
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,519
about every day at loon as a brand that

406
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,000
is really focused and committed to

407
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,480
building out a new narrative telling new

408
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,559
stories about the 3.0 consumer what is

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,879
possible for our industry i think we all

410
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,638
understand that there is a lot of

411
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,078
potential here which is why we're all

412
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,399
here

413
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,039
but creating that bridge telling the

414
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,679
stories both the social justice reform

415
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,919
stories in a palatable way to a consumer

416
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,159
we put out a quarterly magazine at loon

417
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,919
called honestly grown it marries

418
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,399
lifestyle so there might be a feature

419
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,639
about how to style your weed cart

420
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,879
instead of having a bar cart and then

421
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,198
also tells a story about social justice

422
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,000
reform and how we can actually

423
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,759
actionably get people out of prison for

424
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,919
some you know serving these non-violent

425
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,000
cannabis crimes this is something that

426
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,919
every single one of us should be very

427
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,198
not just passionate about but feel as a

428
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,039
moral imperative is part of our work and

429
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:56,319
at loon we take that as part of our

430
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,480
mission so it's it really you see it in

431
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,639
the packaging is recyclable you know the

432
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
little details that really like feed

433
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,720
into we know a lot about cannabis

434
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,360
consumers they care about mother earth

435
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,519
they care about conscious consumerism

436
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,519
how that outlays and how we market and

437
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,959
message i think is so important so

438
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
absolutely it's part of everything

439
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,399
really in the brand ethos and that

440
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,159
bridges the culture i mean it's really

441
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,320
getting people to feel comfortable i

442
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,319
love that palliative stories

443
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,560
that's just awesome palliative stories

444
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
around your brand right and then also

445
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,239
focusing on a lot of the issues and

446
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,440
challenges and aaron i'm sure you can

447
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,198
give us a little bit about that with

448
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,399
ncia in terms of a lot of issues and

449
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,319
challenges in terms of restorative

450
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,440
justice and how that works gives you a

451
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,199
little bit

452
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,959
yeah thanks well when we put this in

453
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,198
perspective um

454
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,278
this you know we've been facing nearly

455
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,879
100 years of marijuana prohibition at

456
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,879
the federal level in the united states

457
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,480
that prohibition policy was put in place

458
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,240
to subjugate people

459
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,720
uh blatantly

460
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,879
um and and let's face it it's not people

461
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,000
that look like me it's it's to subjugate

462
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,759
black and brown communities and we

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
absolutely as we move away from

464
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,199
prohibition we're still in prohibition

465
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,480
but as we move away from it we

466
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,039
absolutely

467
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,959
must ensure that the industry

468
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,958
does everything it can to try to repair

469
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,359
the harm associated with with the

470
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,479
previous policies and nci is always

471
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
there

472
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
educating entrants into the industry

473
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,000
because we are the first place that many

474
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,480
people go when they're they're coming in

475
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,720
to try to find their place in cannabis

476
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,480
and making sure they understand

477
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
that you know what that history is and

478
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,399
what our new role is and this this is a

479
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
once in a lifetime experience that we're

480
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,000
or once in a lifetime opportunity that

481
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,039
we are all engaging in here and creating

482
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
a brand new industry um and an industry

483
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,559
that

484
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,360
we could just you know seed it to big

485
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,159
tobacco big pharma big alcohol

486
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,240
but no we're making sure that we stick

487
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,399
to the values that are you know taught

488
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,879
to us you know through the legacy of the

489
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,360
cannabis plant and the previous industry

490
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,360
that's a big part of us as ncia is being

491
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,839
kind of part of the bully pulpit so to

492
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,320
speak um on the policy side there's a

493
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,199
lot going on at the state and

494
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,199
national level kind of focus on national

495
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,839
um you know i look at what the work we

496
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
do is really kind of bifurcated into two

497
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,759
tracks

498
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,318
lobbying congress and the administration

499
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,359
to pass the kind of ultimate

500
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,599
perfect marijuana bill that's going to

501
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,798
um you know that that will have all of

502
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,719
the you know all the bells and whistles

503
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,119
that we all want to see in a land where

504
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,679
marijuana is legal at coast to coast um

505
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,279
and then also what we can get done like

506
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,038
today or in the you know in the near

507
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,918
future what's politically

508
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,519
possible um on the more comprehensive

509
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,480
legislation side there are something

510
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,400
like seven cannabis bills in congress we

511
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,079
support all of them to some degree um

512
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,519
we're really excited about a new bill

513
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,279
coming out though from that kind of

514
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,679
brings elements from all of them from

515
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,240
senator uh senate majority leader chuck

516
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
schumer should be out by the uh

517
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,558
before the election

518
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,399
which we're really focusing on lobbying

519
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,200
him and his office to understand the

520
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,360
need to include restorative justice

521
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,038
measures in that in that legislation to

522
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,359
ensure that there if there's a federal

523
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,599
licensing system which will be proposed

524
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,279
that that we don't have arbitrary caps

525
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,159
on those licenses that the barrier to

526
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,558
entry capital requirements etc are at a

527
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,480
point to where you know not just anyone

528
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,879
can get a license but

529
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,279
anyone with a reasonable acumen can can

530
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,880
get a license at the federally and then

531
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,200
leave a lot to the states we want to

532
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,160
leave as much as possible to states

533
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,960
because the states have been the

534
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,279
laboratories of democracy all along um

535
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,640
on the kind of what's more practically

536
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,519
likely to happen in the next couple

537
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,520
years i think the biggest most important

538
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,839
policy objective we're working on

539
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,240
is this is a piece of legislation in the

540
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,798
u.s called the safe banking act uh which

541
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,120
would allow u.s banks to do business

542
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,679
with cannabis operators

543
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,359
and licensees without fear of you know

544
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
getting their you know getting shut down

545
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,558
by the feds

546
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,400
and also would allow the cannabis

547
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,480
industry to access financial services

548
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,480
without being gouged many of them are

549
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,960
being gouged with exorbitant fees just

550
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
to deposit their you know

551
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,840
deposit their cash at the end of the

552
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,759
night not to mention they don't have

553
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,079
access to lending and traditional

554
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,720
lending and financial services this bill

555
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,240
would allow would open up the open up

556
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,038
those opportunities which are really

557
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,319
mostly needed by the smaller operators

558
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,720
the big multi-state operators have they

559
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,119
have private sources of capital um and

560
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,640
are not as dependent on uh the things

561
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,719
like the small business administration

562
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,640
and other uh mechanisms that we have for

563
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,079
small businesses in the us

564
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,559

to support these folks

580
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440

states like new york um you know it

582

measures or ways of of supporting these

584
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,399
folks and bridging them from the

585
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
unregulated market to the to the

586
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,960
regulated market you know also bridging

587
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,600
the gap between culture and corporate

588
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,120
here um you know in multi-generational

589

these folks you have been targeted by

594
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,080
the war on drugs let's say um you know

595
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,000
to create opportunities to work with

596
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,759
them in these new types of markets linda

597
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,599
you want to give us an idea what

598
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,440
ispire's doing in that space right now

599
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,879

602
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,520
actually just ran a

603
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
holiday

604
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,200
gift that we donated in instead of you

605
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,119
know spending a bunch of money to send

606
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,038
something we sent a custom we make a

607
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,879
wand which is a torch replacement we had

608
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,079
them custom painted by our friend jv

609
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,840
arty is a well-known artist in the

610
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:06,079
united states and we made a sizable

611
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,399
donation per gift that we gave away in

612
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,720
that person's name to the social impact

613
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,600
center which is founded by two women of

614
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,679
color in san diego and

615
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,359
they are working on

616
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,640
basically the drug war so people have

617
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,479
been

618
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
in disproportionately impacted by the

619
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,798
war on drugs so usually people of color

620
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
people that live in highly policed areas

621
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:27,759
um and really working on initiatives to

622
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,679
make sure that they

623
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,279
are able to vote afterwards and they can

624
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,720
participate in democracy that they can

625
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,599
get good jobs that they're able to move

626
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,679
forward in their lives and um yeah

627
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,558
really the the most important thing for

628
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
us is that pete is is autonomy

629
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,440
sovereignty and everyone being able to

630
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,480
do exactly what they need to do for

631
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,880
themselves

632
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,480
so there's people that we work with one

633
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,799
of our partners is exhibit he's a

634

635
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,519
called napalm

636
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,440
he is you know an african-american guy

637
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,440
who you know was famous for

638
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,120
selling weed and rapping about strippers

639
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,080
and doing this stuff and he's been able

640
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,239
to

641
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,079
raise a cannabis company in a state

642
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
that's traditionally locks people up

643
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,359
with people that look like him that he

644
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,120
would be locked up for doing that if he

645
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,558
didn't have you know the proper lawyers

646
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,639
in the proper capital but we we're

647
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,759
seeing people rising up from situations

648
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,759
where they used to go to jail for

649
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,679
selling weed to being someone that a

650

they're going through their processes

664
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,360
that we can be a true partner to them

665
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,360
and show up with for them with

666
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,599
intentionality instead of just using

667
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,959
them to check boxes off of our list

668
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,558
we actually have jessica redenbo our

669
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,679
marketing director right here in the

670
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,038
audience

671
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,559
she's also a woman of color and an

672
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,158
amazing advocate and activist who's been

673
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,720
in the regulated market in a

674
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,440
pre-regulated market so she runs our you

675
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,519
know our brand and our events and she

676
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,759
very much puts herself into that so like

677
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,519
having women and people of color and

678
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,119
marginalized people at the center of the

679
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,200
decision making is different than just

680
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,639
hiring a couple people to work the front

681
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,919
we need to have them in positions of

682
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,759
leadership and

683
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,840
positions of management and positions of

684
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,200
ownership as well and stop a lot of

685
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,959
companies will do these things where

686
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,798
it's all about optics and pr they just

687
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,519
want things to look good so they'll

688
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,279
check boxes obligatory and it's just it

689
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,440
feels very perfunctory it doesn't feel

690
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,759
authentic and genuine we need people to

691
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,360
actually step up and really be sharing

692
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,119
you know we were talking earlier i i

693
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,879
know in germany um lisa was saying that

694
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,319
it's it's people are you know there's a

695
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,600
brain drain people are leaving their

696
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,359
industry because they're not making

697
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,359
enough money the rich people are not

698
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,639
sharing with the workers and so we have

699
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,240
all these brilliant people who know how

700
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,840
to grow who know how to do these things

701
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,839
that are leaving because it's an abusive

702
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,759
environment so making it a really safe

703
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,599
space connecting with women's groups we

704
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,599
do a ton of work in

705
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,918
women's empowerment just going out of

706
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,678
your way make cutting out time and

707
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,679
cutting out budget

708
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,600
to really overtly do this work with

709
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,519
these people that's awesome and it

710
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,439
really coalesces with their brand

711
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,359
message right because at the end of the

712
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
day it's going to be flowers flowers

713
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,038
flowers flower you know it's really

714
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,278
important to have this message and do

715
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,480
this work for the communities

716
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,480
and for all these different types of

717
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,919
folks and i imagine you know you guys

718
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,519
are doing just as just as good as well

719
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
tell us a little bit about it no

720
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,158
definitely and you know it's kudos to

721
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,240
you guys that i aspire because you know

722
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,880
i think that's all we all need to show

723
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,960
up and at loon we've been really

724
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
dedicated to that from the jump so when

725
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,400
i first started the brand and literally

726
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,558
had no money and was very eager to keep

727
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,559
mission central to everything that we do

728
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,359
i went to last prisoner project and said

729
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:46,960
hey

730
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,038
guys i don't have any money but i want

731
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,038
to support you what can we do can we we

732
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,278
have an amazing creative team can we

733
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,440
create content can we start amplifying

734
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:58,240
the message of what you're trying to do

735
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
we started there and today we have a sku

736
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,599
on the menu all the time at loon where

737
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,919
100 of the proceeds go to mission like

738
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,839
last prisoner project so you know i

739
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,960
really think it's important that at

740
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,639
every level in our industry just show up

741
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,720
you know today i think the most

742
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,520
impactful work we're doing at loon is

743
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,558
with an accelerator called momentum it's

744
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,200
a phenomenal program it supports

745
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,119
underrepresented minorities and folks

746
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,720
disproportionately affected by the war

747
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,959
on drugs

748
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,880
by giving them fifty thousand dollars

749
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,840
with no strings attached no equity

750
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,760
requirements in in their brands helping

751
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,639
them succeed putting them through a

752
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,359
12-week program teaching them things

753
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,520
like you know how important compliance

754
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,399
is it's phenomenal to me as somebody who

755
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,038
has a brand how many founders i meet who

756
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,278
don't have budgets for compliance the

757
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,158
best way we can help the legacy market

758
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,558
bridge the gap is by really educating

759
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,640
and to luna earlier you know mentioned

760
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,519
we need to stop using this blanket term

761
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,559
education we need to flesh it out

762
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,639
education on compliance and really

763
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,720
understanding the market

764
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,559
it seems like there's a massive gap

765
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,400
right now for folks you know if you're

766
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,200
running a billion dollar company and you

767
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,360
have an entire team of lawyers dedicated

768
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,960
to compliance those are not going to be

769
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,599
the same friction points that if you're

770
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,960
a small mom and pop trying to just put

771
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,439
products on the shelf and you don't

772
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,200
understand that the california universal

773
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,960
triangle now has to be a quarter of an

774
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,960
inch instead of half an inch

775
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,278
that can screw up your entire business

776
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,880
so i think you know it's really i'm very

777
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,720
passionate about the work that momentum

778
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
is doing i sit on the committee and as a

779
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,720
brand we also sponsor that initiative

780
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,719
financially

781
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,519
but in general i think the message

782
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,839
should be just show up so if it is the

783
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,599
beach cleanup if it is showing up in

784
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,599
whatever way

785
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,199
put your value system first i think

786
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,678
we're in an industry where that's

787
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,519
incredibly critical more so than in any

788
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,200
other emerging industry there's

789
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,558
obviously the money grab mentality

790
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
that's dominating most of the

791
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:05,038
conversations but you know i think

792
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
mission and authenticity is something

793
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,519
that will always shine through loudest

794
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,919
and and proudest and ultimately the

795
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,400
consumer will choose you know brands

796
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,720
that really and companies that really

797
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,159
show that off awesome awesome and you

798
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,319
know who's showing up for you guys over

799
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,278
here in europe is lisa right here for

800
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,639
germany

801
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,278
excellent get her around our applause

802
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,880
man she's doing a great job for germany

803
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,079
uh women empowerment tell us a little

804
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,559
bit about what's happening in germany in

805
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,000
nebraska yeah well germany it's very

806
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,839
interesting what is happening at the

807
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
moment because we have a little bit

808
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,359
different background than you have in in

809
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,278
the states for example like

810
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,038
compassionate youth programs would not

811
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:42,720
be possible for us like there it's a

812
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,798
very different environment we could not

813
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,960
do recreational grow and then hand out

814
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,679
medicine to people it's two different

815
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,440
systems in the end but um also something

816
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,840
that you can see in the medical market

817
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,440
is that is very important and it's also

818
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,839
something that at rosenthal i don't know

819
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,519
who of you saw his talk prior he said

820
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,599
they're the people who do the work and

821
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,319
the people who got the money so we need

822
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,480
to make sure a little bit more that more

823
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,240
money comes to the people who do the leg

824
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480
work and who are doing the ground work

825
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,159
in terms of patient education for the

826
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,960
medical part for example which are

827
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,760
patient associations and they're mostly

828
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,000
self-funded or have small donations but

829
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,079
like we need to make sure that this big

830
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,200
corporate money also goes down to the

831
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,038
grass root and helps grow the cannabis

832
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,960
plant that we are planting at the moment

833
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,519
and not that everything just stays in

834
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,038
the top and the people who have been in

835
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,960
it for the long run and who have been

836
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,359
working in this industry for 20 years

837
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,519
plus that they cannot participate and

838
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,519
are overrun by huge mainstream

839
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,079
corporates right and it's important as

840
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,639
any business really um you know having

841
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,119
just the good hiring practices or good

842
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,440
vendor selection that really encourages

843
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,398
these folks to participate um that

844
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,720
include you know training and

845
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,000

846
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,278

871

can survive in a world where

872
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,879
corporations coming in that have larger

873
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,798
access to capital refined systems and

874
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
scalability

875
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,240

876
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,730
go ahead

877
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,599
four tips for me

878
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,000
[Music]

879
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,839
well uh i think like uh

880
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,240
one very important thing is to

881
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,918
collaborate and to make sure that all

882
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,558
this normal knowledge that has been

883
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,840
built up over the last years is not lost

884
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:12,000
somewhere but it is transferred and

885
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,079
education i think is very important

886
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,200
everybody should focus more on that and

887
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,278
like really um it's part of our job but

888
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,000
what i would also

889
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,240
would wish more for would be that the

890
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,319
companies understand that especially

891
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,880
this part is like helping people like we

892
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,200
have two over 200 000 cannabis crimes in

893
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,278
germany that are prosecuted every year

894
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
that we have a response is part of our

895
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,440
corporate social responsibility if you

896
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,679
want to put it in a manager world yeah

897
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,440
that we are there and we are not only

898
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,200
there to open up this market to grab

899
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960
market share but we are also there to

900
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,600
give something back

901
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,759
awesome awesome thank you that's amazing

902
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,319
needy what do you got four tips for new

903
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,519
legacy cannabis companies to survive the

904
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,918
oncoming market

905
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,398
yeah i think uh number one educate

906
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,240
yourself and use the expensive mistakes

907
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,479
other markets have made i mean this is

908
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,798
like free and everybody should take

909
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,519
advantage of it

910
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,679
we already paid for it yeah exactly um

911
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,919
invest in compliance i touched on this

912
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,840
earlier i can't stress i think we see

913
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,480
this all the time with folks that we

914
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,158
work with uh who've come from legacy

915
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
there seems to be like either a real

916
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
resistance or this perspective that it's

917
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,119
too expensive

918
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,000
it's the most important thing it should

919
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,079
be foundational to every business

920
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,798
and i'd say embrace innovation and

921
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,038
efficiency i think that we need to hold

922
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,639
hands more the legacy markets and the

923
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,240
newer corporate markets need to hold

924
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,480
hands because if we're going to build

925
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
something that we can all be proud of

926
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,599
it's going to happen together we need

927
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,119
the money from the new

928
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,678
corporate entities and we need the

929
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:47,759
experience from the legacy market

930
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,399
professionals and that's just it's it's

931
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,079
that simple and the last thing is stay

932
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,599
true to your roots like the one thing

933
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,079
that corporate wheat is never going to

934
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,839
have over legacy is a real story you

935
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,759
have that it's built in that

936
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,480
authenticity really shines through i

937
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,480
mean

938
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
you can look at any brand you can look

939
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,798
at any cpg vertical in the world and

940
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,558
ultimately consumership gravitates

941
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,960
toward authenticity and that is

942
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,398
something that you have with timing and

943
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,038
experience and i think we should be

944
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,639
celebrating that as an industry so

945
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,720
yeah those are my four tips awesome

946
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,799

um i didn't prepare anything but it's

950
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:29,119
just like my typical rules it's it's

951

you know get the job done so that's the

952
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,359
efficiency part like don't get don't

don't be focused on instagram don't be

954
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,479
focused on what the other person's doing

955
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,440
don't be focused on anything hire

make this just like coffee or sugar or

963
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,120
any other stimulant like where that's

964
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,240

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,640
not competition right a rising tide

999

what panel you go to what your friends

1005
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,960
say what anyone else says unless someone

1006
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,800
is being paid to follow the laws that

1007
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,559
change constantly the goal posts get

1008
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,159
moved and you're being asked to play a

1009
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,639
game where the rules are changing and

1010
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,480
the stadium changes locations on a daily

1011
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,480
weekly basis you know i'm sure you're

1012
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,000
getting some gray hairs yes it's it's

1013
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,119
very stressful

1014
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,519
so be flexible be adaptive and cover

1015
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,119
your tush because it's people are losing

1016
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,358
their livelihoods they're getting

1017
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,639
arrested in where i'm from the cops will

1018
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,159
come they'll shoot your dog they'll take

1019
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,280
your kids and they'll take your trucks

1020
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,039
in your house and you'll have nothing

1021
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,800
left and you have a felony and you can't

1022
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,279
vote or you know in certain states you

1023
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,599
can't vote um and in certain places

1024
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,519
you're not able to get a job so like

1025
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,280
this is this is a real war that's

1026
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,440
happening this is a civil rights war so

1027
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,280
just watch your back it's not cool

1028
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,440
everywhere in spain it's very serious

1029
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,640
they're arresting people constantly so

1030
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,920
just remember where you are and don't

1031
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,440
get too comfortable because it's not

1032
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,119
legal yet

1033
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,400
absolutely and aaron what you got four

1034
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,920
four tips i absolutely agree with

1035
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,838
everything said here and following up on

1036
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,838
what luna said definitely invest in a

1037
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,000
good attorney and it's not just you know

1038
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,000
the being worried about

1039
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,358
the police kicking in the door it's also

1040
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,639
you know make sure you're you know

1041
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,319
you're working with the right people

1042
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,400
there's a lot of predators out there

1043
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,240
there's a lot of sharks that are trying

1044
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,559
to come in to especially going after

1045
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,759
legacy operators and trying to strike a

1046
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,838
deal

1047
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,680
just so that you know they could get get

1048
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,000
wealthy and bounce out of the industry

1049
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,440
when you know really we're here to stay

1050
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,119
and need to make sure that we have that

1051
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,200
long-term mindset

1052
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,800
and also just i think one of the most

1053
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,279
important things when i see

1054
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,599
uh successful legacy operators you know

1055
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,440
as they enter into the market they're

1056
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,200
you know don't stay isolated connect

1057
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,119
with other people in the industry learn

1058
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,679
from your uh yeah i think you should

1059
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,680
cooperation um and you know not to give

1060
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,598
a shameless plug for you know trade

1061
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,799
associations but join the trade

1062
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,760
associations that represent you and give

1063
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,519
to politicians who support you uh show

1064
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,280
you know show up and speak your mind to

1065
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,079
those who who maybe don't or on the

1066
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,519
fence and be visible um those who kind

1067
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,280
of hide out and you know think that

1068
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,559
they're going to be able to you know

1069
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,320
lay low and not be affected by policy

1070
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,279
changes or regulatory changes or you

1071
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,039
know

1072
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,839
the criminal justice system almost

1073
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,079
always eventually

1074
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:30,880
fail guys give it up this is one of the

1075
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,960

let's uh

1084
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,239
over here

1085
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,800
hey jason shower at modern extractor

1086
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,759
podcast i just wanted to add one thing

1087
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
to too

1088
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,800
what you guys were just saying about the

1089
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,358
advantages that or advice for legacy

1090
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,280
brands entering into the regulated

1091
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,799
market your biggest advantage is the

1092
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,440
network that you've had having to

1093
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,760
operate as a legacy brand so that's

1094
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,200
that's a huge thing for me just wanted

1095
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,599
to throw that out there so use those

1096
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,319
relationships because the uh the big

1097
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,838
corporate big bad wolf doesn't happen

1098
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,280
that's absolutely right i mean having

1099
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,039
you know the relationships is very

1100
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,119
important as you bridge that because you

1101
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,279
can actually share connections and you

1102
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,720
can share those types of resources so

1103
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,079
thank you for adding that that's that's

1104
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,118
really really appreciate that well

1105
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,640
that's what you do with the modern

1106
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,680
extractor podcast right because like

1107
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,118
that's what we're talking about we're

1108
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,719
saying education like you're bringing

1109
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,720
people on to talk about extraction which

1110
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,399
is not as like sexy of a topic as like

1111
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,838
some of these other things but you're

1112
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,599
empowering people to be able to do it

1113
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,599
themselves and teaching a man how to

1114
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,280
fish for himself so you're a perfect

1115
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,359
example of just one person just having a

1116
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,880
microphone bringing people on but that's

1117
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,880
going to be played thousands of times

1118
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,960
hopefully more and that's you know

1119
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,920
that's that's a you're a great example

1120
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,280
thank you

1121
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,280
next question over here

1122
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,159
thank you

1123
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,078
so it's kind of a comment question um i

1124
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,920
actually just recently relocated to

1125
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,160
europe from the us after having been in

1126
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,880
the industry for about seven years um

1127
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,799
and part of what i realized is that

1128
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,640
most of the topic around legacy market

1129
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,800
kind of focuses in the us on the illicit

1130
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,279
market and i don't feel like there's

1131
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,519
enough information about working towards

1132
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,359
medical and honoring the medical system

1133
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,280
in the u.s specifically we've really

1134
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,119
gone in the direction of recreational

1135
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,880
because that's where the money is what

1136
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,800
i'm noticing over here in europe is that

1137
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,720
that's different it seems like lisa has

1138
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,119
some things to add on that that the

1139
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,959
culture is just completely different and

1140
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,559
so a lot of these are kind of north

1141
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,559
american specific problems there's no

1142
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,610
war on drugs over in europe i mean there

1143
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,039
are

1144
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,280
[Applause]

1145
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,719
but um yeah of course maybe each other

1146
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,720
as their own but

1147
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,519
um i just think it's going to have a lot

1148
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,078
more

1149
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,920
education and testing and and a lot of

1150
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,320
the compliance centric that we're really

1151
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,599
going to benefit from back in the u.s

1152
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,280
and i'm really excited to see what

1153
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,800
europe does with that i think that it's

1154
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,839
going to be a really good thing from us

1155
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
as well

1156
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,199
you see one

1157
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,879
yeah i mean definitely if you think

1158
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,598
about standards

1159
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,760
there is no real cannabis standard so

1160
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,320
these standards have to be developed and

1161
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,200
you have a step ahead but i think like

1162
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,519
for the

1163
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,439
for the european ecosystem we need to

1164
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,039
create our own and look at what is

1165
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,358
happening in other areas like for

1166
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,199
example for the medicinal cannabis but

1167
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,039
especially for recreational it shouldn't

1168
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,358
be so strict but still there should be a

1169
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,358
safe product for the consumer but if you

1170
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,279
think of the legacy market in europe

1171
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,440
what are these brands that we have here

1172
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,480
as legacy brands it's the seed banks

1173
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,800
it's the bongs accessories

1174
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,639
stoner media all these kind of things

1175
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,280
those other legacy brands that we have

1176
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,838
here but for the real cannabis producers

1177
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,000
there are no brands this is all illegal

1178
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:54,000
so

1179
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,599
and i would agree with her on that you

1180
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,119
know i also want you to make sure that

1181
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,960
you can differentiate between medical

1182
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,119
and adult use you know medical

1183
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,679
absolutely has a totally different path

1184
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,000
through science and education and really

1185
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,519
the therapeutic uses of cannabis which

1186
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,599
has been done for thousands of years

1187
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,960
right whereas adult use is more like the

1188
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,800
lifestyle

1189
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,639
right so important to understand those

1190
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,560
differentiators but thank you for adding

1191
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,879
that to this and i'm i'm glad that we

1192
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,239
can you know cover that too as well

1193
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,838
next question

1194
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,799
and

1195
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:29,039
our question to the women on the panel

1196
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,720
do you feel that some of the projects

1197
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,719
you've been talking about about

1198
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,358
community and

1199
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,679
um do you feel that women in the

1200
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,598
industry are more com ready to

1201
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,000
collaborate even right the way up to the

1202
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,000
ceo level and this is where a lot of the

1203
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
change is happening by the women pushing

1204
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,599
these good causes whereas the men don't

1205
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,358
necessarily want to talk about it as

1206
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,119
much

1207
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,119
um luna that's

1208
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,960
back when women grow first came out in

1209
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,159
2015 i was one of the bay area chapter

1210
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,720
heads and

1211
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,239
i oh i don't i mean

1212
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,199
it's just the willingness and the

1213
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,639
ability i don't know if it's just

1214
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,159
because women are typically codependent

1215
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,519
so we just say yes to everything we give

1216
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,960
away free consulting all the time i

1217
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,639
don't know if it's a bad thing but it

1218
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,240
definitely feels like camaraderie and

1219
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,799
there's something shared with

1220
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,399
marginalized people i'm also a jew too

1221
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
so like there's this thing about when

1222
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,358
you meet another dude there's just like

1223
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,200
this love of like you kind of understand

1224
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,799
me and women just know without having to

1225
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,239
say anything that we have to work extra

1226
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,079
hard and our ideas are not always

1227
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,078
considered valid and we will say

1228
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,920
something that a man says and it'll be

1229
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,200
ignored until he repeats it and it's

1230
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,280
then it's heralded so there's these

1231
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,439
micro aggressions and these small

1232
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,280
violences every day that wear at your

1233
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,440
self-confidence and your ability to

1234
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,880
really show up fully and so when women

1235
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,800
see that and support each other it's not

1236
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,480
that men don't it's just that there's no

1237
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,960
way for someone who has a majority

1238
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,280
culture um that privilege can ever

1239
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,400
really understand how hard it is to be

1240
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,000
and then once you start adding

1241
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,358
intersectionality of then sexuality race

1242
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,519
you know all that stuff then there's

1243
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,279
like you know you know black women or

1244
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,800
queer black women and all those things

1245
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,560
you have on top of it so we like to

1246
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,240
support each other because it just feels

1247
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,679
like there's already stuff that doesn't

1248
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,118
have to be said and we just know that

1249
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:12,639
we're there for each other in ways that

1250
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,640
i wouldn't say i've always been welcomed

1251
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,480
in by men i i have to prove myself to

1252
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,078
men women automatically accept me for

1253
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,920
the most part

1254
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,000
i'll i'll just add to that and say that

1255
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,079
you know i think that part of you know

1256
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,639
what what we've seen evolve in the in

1257
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,318
the market and in america is this really

1258
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,559
intense sense of

1259
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,559
competition which is really

1260
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,480
misfounded because the reality is is

1261
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,880
that there's so much white space even

1262
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,199
right now in the industry in the us

1263
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,519
i think this idea of collaboration and

1264
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,279
cooperation is actually intrinsic to the

1265
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,519
plan it's a female plan at the end of

1266
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,960
the day we've been using it forever it's

1267
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,400
never going to stop whether it's legal

1268
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,280
or it's illegal or whether it's

1269
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,200
stigmatic or it's not i think women are

1270
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,119
really like you know we're seeing this

1271
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,598
in the united states the amount of

1272
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,760
secret chats and groups and you know

1273
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,160
it's necessary it's an incredibly

1274
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,000
misogynistic industry in the states i i

1275
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,799
can tell you as a woman of color running

1276
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,199
a brand in california i've experienced

1277
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,760
sexual harassment physical assault this

1278
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:14,960
is a really intense industry to be a

1279
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,440
part of um but the good news is is that

1280
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,760
folks like us everybody in this room is

1281
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,400
like awake and that we have these

1282
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,560
conversations because the opportunity to

1283
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,119
exponentially grow is

1284
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,239
like it's boundless so i think when we

1285
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,519
when we have these kinds of

1286
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,118
conversations that luna and i are

1287
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,119
looking at each other you know rolling

1288
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,838
our eyes half and also half like so

1289
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,318
excited because we see the opportunity

1290
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,880
we see you know i'm always open to

1291
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,719
collaboration as a brand i don't view my

1292
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,640
fellow ceos of other brands as

1293
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,719
competitors i view them as part of the

1294
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,719
same class like we all have the same

1295
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,480
ptsd we all have the same adrenal

1296
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,799
fatigue we're all getting beaten up at

1297
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,318
the same rate so let's hold hands and do

1298
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
it together because at the end of the

1299
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,800
day the enemies the real enemies of our

1300
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,680
industry your tobacco big pharma like

1301
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,760
let's be real like we need to be focused

1302
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:07,519
and be aligned and work together i think

1303
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,400
it's it's massive so amen awesome

1304
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:13,440
awesome that's amazing thank you so much

1305
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,079
thank you i would like i would like to

1306
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,880
to thank and congratulate all the

1307
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,119
speakers you have been brilliant

1308
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,358
i think when it comes to education it's

1309
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,119
very hard for us to talk

1310
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,318
without expressing

1311
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,079
the need to work with schools and at the

1312
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,920
university level

1313
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,720
because we need to prepare

1314
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,000
all the health professionals

1315
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,159
[Music]

1316
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,039
on this subject you know

1317
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,440
and it's hard to believe that things are

1318
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:47,519
going to change if you don't involve

1319
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,679
schools and universities and also the

1320
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,838
biggest organizations corporations in

1321
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,519
the world that lead with education like

1322
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:54,639
unicef

1323
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,119
u.n

1324
00:44:54,639 --> 00:45:00,559
and unesco

1325
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,519
world bank and all the institutions that

1326
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:02,880
that

1327
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,039
finance

1328
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,519
the education around the world we need

1329
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,519
to have this subject on the manuals on

1330
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,679
the textbooks

1331
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,599
in schools in different areas in

1332
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,559
different degrees

1333
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,440
and that's why for example i am at this

1334
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:22,159
point organizing the

1335
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,119

00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,078
hemp

1337
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,640
and

1338
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,680
related with cannabis in lisbon

1339
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,639
on june 18 and 19th

1340
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,279
we are

1341
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,519
in lisbon talking about all these

1342
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,839
subjects and bringing not only

1343
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:41,358
politicians and entrepreneurs and this

1344
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:43,440
and that but also journalists who need

1345
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:44,838
a lot this preparation

1346
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,960
schools

1347
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,159
universities june 18 and 19 in lisbon

1348
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,440
thank you so much so i think

1349
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:52,879
congratulations thank you i think

1350
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,519
there's two things happening one there's

1351
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,960
a conspiracy uh because of big pharma

1352
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,559
that doesn't want people to grow their

1353
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,240
own and they also don't want doctors to

1354
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,759
learn about the endocannabinoid system

1355
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:03,519
so there's like that private interest

1356
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,319
and that whole thing but also

1357
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,318
until this is not federally illegal in

1358
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:10,000
most countries none of these other

1359
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,239
banking institutions everything has to

1360
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,519
come from

1361
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:15,279
decriminalization or from descheduling

1362
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,599
it in our it needs to come down from

1363
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,200
being a hard drug because none of these

1364
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,480
people they all have lawyers even like

1365
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,480
instagram

1366
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,519
their lawyers just read cannot promote

1367
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,760
the use or sale of drugs promoting the

1368
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,280
use could just be smoking they're just

1369
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,200
the lawyers of all these things are just

1370
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,839
reading the laws so the banks it's not

1371
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,199
really up to them until we decriminalize

1372
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,039
no one's going to get on board and put

1373
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,118
it in schools it's just how it is that's

1374
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:40,639
why we that's why we need lobbying

1375
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,039
they're just waiting i don't even think

1376
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,078
that there's like a cultural like i

1377
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,119
don't even necessarily think that

1378
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,920
they're they're doing that sorry guys

1379
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,519
yeah

1380
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,800
so yeah i i just think that we need to

1381
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,759
remember that

1382
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,200
until we

1383
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,240
they're waiting for the green light i

1384
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,480
think people are actually going to be

1385
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,759
excited i think you know harvard medical

1386
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,079
school i'm sure wants to teach about the

1387
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,599
endocannabinoid system until until they

1388
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,240
feel like they can do it without losing

1389
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,519
their federal funding it's a gag rule

1390
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,799
it's a literal gag rule they will not

1391
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,039
give you federal funding if you teach

1392
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,480
these things in schools right right well

1393
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:12,079

1394
