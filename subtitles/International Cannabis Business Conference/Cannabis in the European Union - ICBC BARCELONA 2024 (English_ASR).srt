1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,439
well I'd like to thank ICBC for inviting

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,519
me back um you know being an economist I

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,559
I didn't bore the crowd too much last

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,000
year so you know I have uh two daughters

5
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:16,320
and one of the daughters refers to

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,320
economics as not just economics but

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,278
boring economics and so hopefully today

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,439
I won't uh I won't inundate you with too

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,719
many data points um and so my other

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,879
daughter is going to college next year

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:35,600
and I asked her if she was going to

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:38,119
study economics she said hell

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
no um but my name is Bo Whitney I'm the

14
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,000
chief Economist at Whitney economics

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,679
we're based out of Portland Oregon um on

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,079
the west coast of the United

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,920
States um today I'm going to talk about

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,878
going to try to provide an overview of

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,920
the world the US Europe and then dig

20
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:59,358
into some Spain data um and so like I

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,239
said we're a global leader in cannabis

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,118
and hemp research and we provide data um

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,519
to governments to

24
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:11,519
operators um to investors and the

25
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:14,280
like um and so um I'm going to talk

26
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,560
specifically about Spain um as well

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,000
there's there's some really interesting

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,240
data out of Spain these days um but just

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,719
as an overview and I know that it's a

30
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,959
friendly audience but you know cannabis

31
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,039
is really three Industries in one

32
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,039
there's the adult use there's Medical

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,399
coal and then there's industrial and

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,799
Industrial is also known as hemp and

35
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,359
then within hemp there's the cannabinoid

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,840
there's three Industries in one uh with

37
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,000
with hemp you know industrial and the

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,600
are the cannabinoids and fibers and

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,239
Grain and so there's lots of Economic

40
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:53,078
Opportunity in either of these sectors

41
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,798
and so it's just important to choose one

42
00:01:53,078 --> 00:02:00,559
and and run with it um and um a lot of

43
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,560
countries are viewing cannabis ref form

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
favorably as a tool for economic

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,519
development it's different for one

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,280
country versus another but they're

47
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,479
looking at this for job creation for tax

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,959
revenue for reductions in uh Health Care

49
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,560
spending because of the health benefits

50
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,080
of cannabis as a proactive um medicine

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,039
and the like so lots of Interest right

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,719
now in cannabis

53
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:30,159
reform in fact um and giata touched upon

54
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,800
this earlier today there's over 150

55
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,239
countries that have uh legalized access

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,719
to cannabis in some form or another from

57
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:45,200
adult use from medical um or um even

58
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,800
CBD and so various reform um um you know

59
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,919
entails different

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,480
opportunities and when you combine hemp

61
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:56,000
and uh adult use and medical together um

62
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:59,399
it's a trillion dollar market um with a

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,360
half a a billion consumers so lots of

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,360
opportunity out

65
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:08,439
there

66
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:11,158
now putting together total potential

67
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,359
Market data a lot of the analysts

68
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,239
usually look at the UN ODC numbers the

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,680
United sta or the United Nations data

70
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,799
that looks at um um usage rates and they

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,120
they do these interviews in country by

72
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,519
country sometimes there's five years

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,560
that separate the interiew the the

74
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,200
surveys you know and the Congo from you

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,120
know 2005 and then 2010 and maybe 2020

76
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,679
so it's kind of fits and starts and so I

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,400
use the UN data as a baseline I consider

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,519
that the low-end because it's very

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,879
conservative and then I build my models

80
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,438
um um based upon other countries and um

81
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,840
and then um so I've developed a midpoint

82
00:03:53,438 --> 00:04:00,878
and a in an upper bound so um what I've

83
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:05,239
got here um on the right hand side

84
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:08,359
on this side um is how things break down

85
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,959
from that legal perspective so um

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,920
although there's legal Revenue there's

87
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,798
potential revenue and so in the medical

88
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,639
countries where there's legal access

89
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,798
those markets are huge and they're the

90
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,000
largest opportunity so um if you get in

91
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:27,000
there and then things go adult use then

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,319
there's huge upside potential in that

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,879
market and so um medical is by far the

94
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,959
largest opportunity um even outpacing um

95
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,120
elicit and so I found that to be kind of

96
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,959
interesting when I was running this data

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,280
um but you've got about a half a billion

98
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:48,758
dollar market in the in the um midpoint

99
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,758
um and so huge Global

100
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:55,959
potential now I want to talk a little

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,639
bit about the US market um it's it's in

102
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,638
a bit of a state of disarray right now

103
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,918
there's a lot of murkiness about what

104
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,519
the policy should be the federal

105
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,959
legalization there's banking issues

106
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,680
there's taxation issues there's social

107
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,359
Equity issues there's interstate

108
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,478
commerce um prohibitions and so uh you

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,199
really have to look at the US in discret

110
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:24,360
markets state by state by state um and

111
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,478
so it's super fragmented um and their

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,560
The Regulators at the state level and at

113
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,478
the federal level are really having

114
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
difficulty managing the differences

115
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,800
between hemp and the policies related to

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,759
hemp and managing the difference between

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,720
hemp and adult use and medical and so

118
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,120
they first separated them and then now

119
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,680
they're trying to put them back together

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,360
because they are looking at hemp as

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,079
cannabinoids and intoxicating rather

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,400
than hemp in those three distinct

123
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:57,719
markets that I mentioned earlier so um

124
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,159
but as a result of all of this murkiness

125
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,280
this um um

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,160
you know toggle between hemp and adult

127
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,038
use um it's actually disincentivizing

128
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,199
consumers to participate in the legal

129
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:15,120
markets in fact 11 states last year saw

130
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,720
declines in sales rather than increases

131
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,598
in sales and so there was um the level

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,560
of growth was um much less than it than

133
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,918
it has been before covid and be and when

134
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,959
the reform really started taking place

135
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,598
during the green Rush um and a business

136
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,638
condition survey that I published a

137
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:39,279
report that I published about a year ago

138
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,439
said that 24% of cannabis operators in

139
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,638
the United States were profitable

140
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:49,478
24% so that means 76% were either

141
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:53,199
breaking even or not and so it it talks

142
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:56,639
about the health of the US cannabis

143
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,639
Market um and then I just am on the cusp

144
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,160
of publishing a report on delinquent

145
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,439
payments

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,639
um and basically in the United States

147
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,399
operators aren't paying other operators

148
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,478
and so there's an incentive because of

149
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,439
the high cost of capital there's an

150
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:15,560
incentive just not to pay each other

151
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,560
because you're you can finance that debt

152
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,000
for free rather than going to a bank if

153
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,199
you can get one um and paying 35 to 40%

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,478
interest rates so the way that the

155
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,038
system in the United States works is

156
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,279
that it incentivizes businesses not to

157
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,560
pay each other

158
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,679
and so this is this has never been

159
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,160
published before but the amount of

160
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,959
delinquent receivables in the United

161
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:45,120
States in at the end of 2023 was $3.8

162
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:48,198
billion now that's almost two months of

163
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,879
Revenue in the entire legal Market in

164
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,478
the United States it's 1.6 months so

165
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,639
this is a huge existential threat that

166
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,918
very few people are talking about so if

167
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,280
you don't pay each other then it's tough

168
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,079
to pay your own bills it's tough to pay

169
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,719
your own Debt Service it's tough to

170
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,399
tough to pay your taxes um and so I'm

171
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,840
going to publish a report next week on

172
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:13,878
this U with more details but that's kind

173
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:16,399
of late breaking news um and uh so it's

174
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,919
it's a policy issue that needs to be

175
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,279
addressed and the policy makers right

176
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:24,038
now are so focused on intoxicating hemp

177
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,279
that they're not taking care of their

178
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:30,560
own markets from adult use and medical

179
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,199
regulatory uh perspective now this is a

180
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,399
lesson to be learned for Europe because

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,680
it's important that if you regulate a

182
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,519
market you should try to not only

183
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,239
regulate it and continue to stay on it

184
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,440
but also um consider the health of the

185
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,600
operators that you're trying to regulate

186
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,080
and right now um there's a health issue

187
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,879
associated with operators in adult use

188
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,399
and can and Medical in the United

189
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,759
States now we put together a forecast

190
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:03,240
this is a refresh forecast from last

191
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,078
year we actually took down the 2024

192
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,720
forecast by $3

193
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,759
billion um and be and the reason that we

194
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,320
took it down it's still showing growth

195
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,039
9% growth but just not the type of

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,079
growth that you would expect um

197
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,599
postco and the reason we took it down is

198
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:23,719
that higher interest rates there's

199
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,720
inflation um and there's just not enough

200
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,720
money being loaned out there in order to

201
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,000
get businesses opened up and ramping and

202
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,759
so those ramps are kind of muted and so

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,440
we're forecasting that this growth rate

204
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:42,360
will be lower um than normal in

205
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,760
2024 2025 and it'll start accelerating

206
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,480
in the back half of 2025 so still pretty

207
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:52,480
decent growth any industry would want

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,200
10% growth or 9% growth um but in

209
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,240
cannabis in the United States is a bit

210
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,680
of a disappointment and a lot of the

211
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,720
growth is going to come not from the

212
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,159
mature markets like Colorado or Oregon

213
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,839
or Washington but will come from new

214
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:09,000
markets that have just deployed their

215
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,000
program and starting to

216
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:17,679
ramp so um I took down the I just

217
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,360
published the global forecast as well

218
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,559
and the European market is like the

219
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,360
second largest market in the on the

220
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:29,319
globe um from a potential Revenue

221
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,519
perspective um it's it's fourth or fifth

222
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,600
fth from a consumer perspective um but

223
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:39,240
the um the total addressable markets

224
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,680
about 53 billion On The Low End um giata

225
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,639
earlier today published 68 million or 68

226
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,359
billion that was in more in the middle

227
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,159
of my forecast and then um there's an

228
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,159
upper bound as well which could be in

229
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,639
the hundreds of billions of dollars it

230
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:57,480
just depends upon which countries you

231
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,320
consider um and so the this I take some

232
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,440
of the statistics from the World Bank

233
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:06,120
and so they consider Russia as part of

234
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,920
uh the EU or the part of Europe and so

235
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,919
um so they tend to um bring up the

236
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:15,360
numbers a little bit um now there's

237
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:20,278
Germany is in Focus right now because of

238
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,320
what's going on next week um but if they

239
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:26,639
continue to Waffle back and forth on

240
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,399
their policy there's a good chance that

241
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,600
um Spain and other countries could start

242
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:35,120
influencing the European Reform movement

243
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,959
um more so than Germany and so it just

244
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,759
depends upon the timing um but when

245
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:43,559
these large countries like the United

246
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,078
States or Germany tend to Waffle then it

247
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,278
opens up opportunities for other

248
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:51,278
countries to take the lead um and so um

249
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,120
there's very little data in the about

250
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,480
the European markets um but it's getting

251
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,879
better um and we're here to help so if

252
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,959
you need any data or insights I'll have

253
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,120
my cont contact information at the back

254
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,119
half of this um

255
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,720
presentation so um five countries make

256
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:14,638
up majority of the demand um that's 53

257
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,440
billion now that's on the low end um and

258
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,799
so Spain you see and there is right

259
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,800
around5 billion dollar I'm sorry I

260
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,679
didn't put this in Euros um I'll when I

261
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,958
speak in Berlin I'll put these in Euros

262
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:31,039
but $5 billion is a pretty decent Market

263
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:35,159
um now for perspective um um you know

264
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:38,599
that's maybe the size of some states in

265
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:41,000
the United States like New York um and

266
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,720
so but still a pretty decent market now

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,120
that's total Market that doesn't it's

268
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:51,600
that's illicit plus legal or whatever

269
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,600
you really call legal here in

270
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:59,359
Spain now um there's based upon the UN

271
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:03,600
numbers there's 3.3 million consumers of

272
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,159
cannabis in Spain um and it's a very

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,000
popular reform is very popular um and so

274
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:15,799
the citizens want reform at least for

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,198
medical um 84% based upon recent surveys

276
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:21,599
um but there could be as many as seven

277
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:24,639
or eight million consumers in this space

278
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,600
now right now that's not being serviced

279
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,039
by the legal Market obviously and so all

280
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,360
of this is elicit and and so the supply

281
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:36,559
is coming in both domestically and from

282
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,278
Africa and from the rest of Europe um

283
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,439
and so what I have here is also the

284
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:45,120
amount of total consumption from a

285
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,480
output perspective so total amount of

286
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,198
pounds um of output that you would need

287
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:57,079
to satisfy all this demand and so it's

288
00:13:51,198 --> 00:14:01,359
um 824 th000 kilos um and so that's um

289
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:05,039
824 tons now for perspective this last

290
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:09,320
year there was roughly 24 tons produced

291
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,838
and maybe 36 tons this year so only 4%

292
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,600
of the total

293
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,480
demand um is being produced from a

294
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,839
supply perspective now when you talk

295
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,879
about cannabis a lot of people talk

296
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,279
about the demand but they don't talk

297
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,198
about Supply but Supply is super

298
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,639
important if you don't have enough

299
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,639
prices stay up and consumers remain on

300
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,560
the elicit Market if you have have too

301
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,799
much then prices collapse which is great

302
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,198
for Consumer and and

303
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,879
participation but it's not good for The

304
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,278
Operators because it compresses their

305
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:45,480
margins so striking a balance of supply

306
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:49,639
versus demand is is super important in

307
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,560
any Market that you go into now Canada

308
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,879
started this the US followed suit Europe

309
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,119
maybe right behind them but um nobody

310
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,759
seems to have learned from the mistakes

311
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,039
of other countries

312
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,600
and so um Canada they

313
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,439
oversupplied prices crashed they

314
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,759
actually ended up destroying a lot of

315
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
cannabis they were hoping to ship it to

316
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,680
Europe and it didn't quite work out very

317
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,959
well they were hoping to ship it to the

318
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,078
United States but they didn't legalize

319
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:21,278
but then the United States they are over

320
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:24,399
producing right now in fact there's more

321
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:27,679
capacity legally authorized in the

322
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,159
United States then all of the consumers

323
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:34,120
elicit and legal in the United States

324
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:37,799
there's already more capacity so this is

325
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,720
you know has a potential of uh crashing

326
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,159
uh prices oversupplying markets and then

327
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,199
really hurting potential opportunities

328
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:47,480
for other people who want to enter into

329
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,479
other

330
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,639
states now I talked about industrial

331
00:15:52,399 --> 00:16:00,440
hemp and so I just wanted to comment

332
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:04,278
that even with just a few um sectors

333
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,079
automobile um construction Plastics with

334
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:09,480
a sco of cannabinoids in there uh the

335
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,519
hemp Market is actually bigger than the

336
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:16,079
adult use of Medical Market globally and

337
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,600
so when people talk about cannabis um

338
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:22,078
there's a lot of influence that could be

339
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,000
made by the hemp industry um and hemp

340
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,879
may be The Driver of cannabis reform

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,519
more so than a medical to adult use

342
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:34,958
conversion um but um just wanted to talk

343
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,799
about this now in some countries they

344
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,518
view it all as Canabis and then in other

345
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,719
countries they like in the United States

346
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:49,560
they try to differentiate based upon THC

347
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:52,240
content um but um regardless of um oh

348
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,479
and and this differentiation can create

349
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,198
conflicts between the hemp industry and

350
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,120
the marijuana industry especially when

351
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:04,240
it comes to intoxicating Canabis noids

352
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:07,160
and um but there so that conflict I

353
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,480
think is unfortunate and I think hemp

354
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,720
and marijuana can coexist and they

355
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,000
should because it's all basically the

356
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,000
same

357
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,880
plant um now just like and one of the

358
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,439
panelists I think it was uh Jamie pson

359
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,000
mentioned that um uh the EU is similar

360
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,400
to the US in the fact that EU rules over

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,160
IDE countries and then countries

362
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,280
override their states or provinces or

363
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,120
what have you um the same thing um

364
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,759
applies the United States from a federal

365
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:46,839
to state to um County to City

366
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:48,919
perspective um but a lot of the

367
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,199
countries in the EU are defaulting to

368
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:54,280
the EU policy and they're not

369
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,960
challenging it um now there is a a rule

370
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:59,399
that says if it's legal in one country

371
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,960
and it's not for medical

372
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,159
purposes then you can it's it's legal to

373
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,480
be sold in all countries in the EU and

374
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,600
so that's an interesting concept that is

375
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,839
worth exploring because it's like I

376
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,839
think there's somebody from Portugal

377
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,359
here right so you produce in Portugal

378
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:18,839
and then you can ship into Germany or

379
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:23,000
ship into other

380
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:26,319
markets okay so it it's the concept

381
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,038
that right okay so there's nuances to it

382
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:32,000
but the concept is the same um if it's

383
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,960
the principle of of shipping into a

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,279
unified Market versus uh carving that

385
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:43,159
market out um with individual um rules

386
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:45,798
and regulations so um if as a investor

387
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,679
or as an operator you get set up in one

388
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,319
country then there's opportunities

389
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,000
because of the size of these markets

390
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,480
there's opportunities later on if you're

391
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,119
able to establish a good brand a good

392
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,759
quality product and you can conform

393
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:03,038
within the EU uh specific

394
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:06,839
ation um and so a lot of people are

395
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:09,240
looking to the EU here in the uh in

396
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,199
these European countries uh the EU is

397
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,960
looking to the US the US isn't really

398
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,960
doing anything and so it's kind of like

399
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,840
which Domino will fall first before

400
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,919
there's a rapid acceleration of Reform

401
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:26,359
um and that's tough to predict I'm not

402
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,799
going to opine on that but um if if um

403
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,279
some of these larger countries like I

404
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:33,599
said don't get

405
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:36,119
um um don't make some clarity on their

406
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,359
policies then they may be supplanted as

407
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,359
world

408
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,839
leaders so and I wanted to blast through

409
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,600
this um presentation so that I could

410
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,879
take some questions later on because I'm

411
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,279
sure there's lots of questions on the

412
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,799
data or at least I hope there are um but

413
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,639
if you're too shy to make any questions

414
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:59,480
then um feel free to reach out U with my

415
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,038
contact information and um I'd be more

416
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,558
than happy to share this presentation

417
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,359
and some of the data with it um but in

418
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:09,798
terms of prediction um Germany is on the

419
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:12,479
cusp of being the first um and then I'm

420
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:15,918
anticipating a a rapid expansion of

421
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Reform um these pilot programs and

422
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,480
Social Clubs it's a novel um idea um and

423
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,759
it's worth

424
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,880
pursuing um

425
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,279
and um look for a regulation around

426
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,799
certified seeds because

427
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,359
uh you have to start with stable

428
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,879
genetics and right now in the United

429
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,158
States you don't have that but in Europe

430
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,880
um it's um pretty established it's a a

431
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,880
very established Market the certified

432
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,559
seed program um and Public Safety will

433
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,520
remain foremost in the eyes of the

434
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:52,000
policy makers and so as business

435
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:55,480
operators it's important to consider um

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,400
Public Safety and build that in and uh

437
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,599
hemp will be a major um Market not only

438
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,759
in in the US but in Europe as

439
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,678
well so recommendations um

440
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,000
communicate

441
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,278
educate know everything about your

442
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,558
business and your cost structure because

443
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,480
when I talk about over Supply what that

444
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,599
does is it compresses margins uh right

445
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,200
now there's inflation so when you have

446
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,480
falling prices and increasing costs that

447
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
really squeezes the profits out of your

448
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,960
business and so if you don't know your

449
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,320
cost structure then you don't know when

450
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,319
to make um critical decisions about your

451
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,558
business so understanding cost structure

452
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,558
is really really important and then also

453
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:43,599
staying focused on your core competency

454
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,678
you can't be um you know uh everything

455
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,439
to everybody it's just it's not possible

456
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,919
and it hasn't proven to be successful in

457
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,798
the United States for example uh

458
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:57,559
vertical integration was a big uh was in

459
00:21:53,798 --> 00:22:00,679
Vogue for a long time um but in my

460
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:02,278
delinquency report I'm finding that even

461
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,720
if you're vertically integrated and

462
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:07,679
control all the costs within your

463
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,558
vertical um they're still one of the

464
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,640
largest contributors to delinquencies um

465
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,319
in the entire space so there's still

466
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,720
delinquent payment issues um even in

467
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:20,359
vertical integrated companies so it's

468
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,240
important to carve off what you know and

469
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,918
what you're good at and then pursue that

470
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,880
with Vigor and passion and so uh another

471
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,559
thing is is that although we're in Spain

472
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,600
and a lot of the focus is on Spain at

473
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:37,879
your business when we're in Germany

474
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:41,000
Focus isn't on Germany and so uh

475
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,799
cannabis is a very local issue but

476
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,679
really remember that this is a global

477
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:48,558
market and so it's important to act

478
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,320
local but keep the global market in mind

479
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,759
because it will have an eventual

480
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:57,960
influence on your business and on your

481
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,079
success so with that um you know feel

482
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,840
free to reach

483
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:05,720
out um lots of data lots to digest and

484
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:09,278
so just uh let me know um and so I'm

485
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,278
happy to take questions thank you

486
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,278

487
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,879

493
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,918
Secor and with reassure um we're based

494
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,960
out of Michigan in us um just my

495
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,799
question in general is this data

496
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,720
especially the delinquent payments is

497
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:48,278
this among um more cannabis to cannabis

498
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,200
say B Growers to producers or do you did

499
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,919
you in factor in the safety compliance

500
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,519
testing aspect of this as well so my

501
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,880
delinquent report that's coming out next

502
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:03,639
week um on my website um it's a a free

503
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,320
report um it looked at not only all the

504
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,159
uh sectors and sub sectors within

505
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:10,639
cannabis Laboratory Testing included but

506
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,240
it also looked at ancillary businesses

507
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,000
and so I was presenting at a a group of

508
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,720
uh CPA certified public accountants now

509
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,400
who's more boring economists or

510
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,960
accountants I kind of vote accountants

511
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,798
um but um in that uh the accountants the

512
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,519
CPAs were saying that they're not

513
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:33,200
getting paid

514
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,599
and so the the um so these ancillary

515
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,880
businesses lawyers aren't getting paid

516
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,879
and so the question becomes an ethical

517
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,760
dilemma for them do we not pay or do

518
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,278
their taxes this season because they

519
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,879
haven't paid us for last season or do we

520
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:51,398
go ahead and just you know put more

521
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,520
Revenue at risk and so there um needs to

522
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:57,158
be some discipline in here but it looked

523
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,558
at all sectors retail had it the easiest

524
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,840
because they are closest to the the

525
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,038
consumer and so they tended to be the

526
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,119
ones that didn't pay uh through you know

527
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:08,278
through the uh product manufacturers and

528
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,599
the cultivators cultivators on a

529
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:12,919
percentage basis took it the hardest

530
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:16,398
meaning that they had the toughest time

531
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,640
getting payment from others um and then

532
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:20,839
the vertical integrated companies were

533
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,880
also big contributors and multi-state

534
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,918
operators

535
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,840
unfortunately um the average um per MSO

536
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,559
was like $32 million in delinquent

537
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,119
payments so it's you know everybody's

538
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,158
contributing um and so there could be

539
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:40,479
some um regulatory intervention that's

540
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,799
required to um mandate payment adherence

541
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,319
or cash on delivery or what have you so

542
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:49,398
uh bit of an extended answer to your

543
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,119
question but um Michigan is a tough

544
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:55,558
Market because there's lots of

545
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,678
operators um falling prices you've got

546
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,839
huge legal participation because the

547
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,399
consumers like the smaller the lower

548
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,480
prices but it's tough to be profitable

549
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:06,119
in that type of environment and then

550
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,558
when you're not getting paid on top of

551
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,759
that um you know 10 months of of cash

552
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:15,678
flow for a 12-month business that's not

553
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:18,919
a recipe for Success so thanks for the

554
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,919
question I'm

555
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,798
running thank you for your discussion is

556
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,640
very very interesting I'm Victor Herz

557
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,359
independent visor uh principle uh I

558
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,320
found your comment about how in the

559
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:37,119
United States uh through the farm Bild

560
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,839
they they defined hemp versus uh

561
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,599
cannabis or marijuana as um as a

562
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,798
pivotable move but now it's a

563
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,000
problematic move obviously with THC 8 n

564
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:52,158
and all of that uh one question I have

565
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,759
for you is um that in

566
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,919
1718 CBD was present in so many consumer

567
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,278
products in the United States

568
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:06,759
and with the definition of hemp as

569
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:09,480
distinct and it going from uh DEA to FDA

570
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:11,798
it's run into Thicket I'm just wondering

571
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,200
if you could share uh with the audience

572
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,038
uh some of the learnings of that

573
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,640
experience and if there's any

574
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:21,079
applicability to uh uh the market

575
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,399
development here in Europe thank you so

576
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:24,240
when it comes to the evolution of the

577
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:27,639
hemp

578
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,319
industry early on in between 2014 and

579
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,960
2018

580
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:35,759
um there was very few um Farms that grew

581
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,880
hemp and when they did they grew up for

582
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:42,759
fiber and for grain and as a result

583
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,440
there wasn't a lot of canabo um plants

584
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:49,240
and raw materials available and so the

585
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:54,200
cost of uh CBD isolet for example could

586
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:57,000
easily run $40,000 a kilo um then people

587
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,000
seeking Riches of seeing those high

588
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,480
prices they entered into the market due

589
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,159
to one of the um agricultural reform

590
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,278
bills called the the farm bill and so at

591
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,278
one point 500 25,000 Acres were licensed

592
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:13,558
82% of that was for cannaboid

593
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,519
production um there was no

594
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,599
infrastructure there was very little

595
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,960
processing little drawing and little

596
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:23,119
Awareness on how to grow this stuff and

597
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,798
so there was a surplus of cannabinoid

598
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,678
raw materials in the

599
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:30,119
market that drove prices down the very

600
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,000
next year year um people didn't learn

601
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,398
from their mistakes other states entered

602
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,159
into it and doubled the amount of excess

603
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:41,798
inventory so you had this 201 million

604
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:45,640
pounds of excess cannabinoid raw

605
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:49,200
material 2 million kilos of CBD isolate

606
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,440
just sitting on the shelves so somebody

607
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,000
had to figure out how to monetize that

608
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,519
and so that brought in some emerging

609
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,880
innovation in the Delta 8 Delta 10 hhc

610
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:03,599
markets and so they were able to um

611
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,360
develop products that were intoxicating

612
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,839
that were had market demand and they

613
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:13,759
were able to consume a lot of that raw

614
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:16,879
material well now that um a lot of that

615
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:19,119
um U raw material inventory has been

616
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,240
consumed a lot of the farmers have

617
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,759
gotten out of the industry so instead of

618
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,359
having 525,000 Acres you're back to

619
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:30,119
prearm bill at 30,000 acres and a major

620
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:31,519
of that now is fiber and grain so

621
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,798
there's a common theme here where you

622
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:37,480
have this huge Spike on cannabinoids and

623
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:41,639
then now it's going back to its roots um

624
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,440
in the fiber and grain sector so um but

625
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,000
policy makers have been trying to

626
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,200
address the influx of cannabinoids into

627
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,960
and competing with the medical and adult

628
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,919
use um products and so when I did the

629
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,399
analysis and published this late last

630
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,278
year the total addressable mark Market

631
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,000
in the United States for cannabinoids

632
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:07,798
derived from hemp was $28

633
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,278
billion well last year the sales of of

634
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:14,119
legal adult use and medical was $28

635
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,880
billion so there's a huge Market which

636
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:19,119
may or may not be able to be sustained

637
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,440
um with the current amount of acreage

638
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,719
right now that's being licensed in the

639
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,120
United States now can Europe learn from

640
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,480
that well they've already have kind of

641
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,759
taught the US lesson where they've

642
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,038
controlled the production they've

643
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,359
insisted on certified seed they have

644
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:37,200
good regulation um it's tight control

645
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,079
but there's still opportunity

646
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,200
nonetheless for hemp in the United

647
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:44,439
States especially on the fiber and grain

648
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,679
side for industrial applications 20% of

649
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,679
of Mercedes cars are Parts derived from

650
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,440
hemp and so there's already these

651
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,919
industrial applications in automobile

652
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,519
industry and Plastics and the like that

653
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,120
go beyond the cannabinoid side of the

654
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,558
hemp Market

655
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,278
okay maybe one more and gu or do you

656
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,599
have time for one more question sorry we
