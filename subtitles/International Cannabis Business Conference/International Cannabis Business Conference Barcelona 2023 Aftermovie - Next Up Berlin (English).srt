00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,379
So, I just want to say thank you. My name is  Alex Rogers. I am the founder of the ICBC,  

2
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,179
and I want to give my heartfelt thanks to you  guys. We're here for business and with business,  

3
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,719
I found out, the more you perpetuate  the business, the more you perpetuate  

4
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,100
the politics and move the public policy  forward. And that's what we're here to do.

5
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:43,019
Yeah, I'm so happy to be here at the ICBC and  having Whova as a platform to be connected  

6
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,760
with all the key players in the industry.  I think it's a really good place to be.

7
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,259
The ICBC is a very important event and conference  for the European industry to build its identity,  

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:05,700
ask questions itself, develop the  professional community of people who  

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,740
are invested and engaged in the emerging  European cannabis industry. It's a very  

10
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,359
unique space in terms of being able to connect  with people who are working very diverse parts.

11
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:29,759
I think the networking potential of the  ICBC is very unique. As I said, it brings  

12
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,880
a very diverse range of people together,  you know, from operations, branding. So,  

13
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,799
in a very short space of time, they can cover  a lot of ground in terms of different roles,  

14
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,019
viewpoints, and people involved in  the European space and beyond. So  

15
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,739
the networking element of the ICBC is  a very important aspect of it as well.

16
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,839
We'd love to come back again, and  we are really looking forward to  

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,240
go as well to Berlin. We would love to be there.
