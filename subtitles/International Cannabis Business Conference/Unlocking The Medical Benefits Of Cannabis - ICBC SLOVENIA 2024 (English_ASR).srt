and for the introduction I would like to

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,479
say just a few words about medicine

35
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,519
cannabis in medicine and we know that it

36
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:55,438
has been used in medicine for thousands

37
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:58,599
of years thousands of years in many old

38
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,599
but civilized cultur cultures and uh

39
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,839
actually started all in China about 500

40
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,478
years ago but then the really

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Renaissance of modern cannabis medical

42
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,800
Sciences was done in Israel and the

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,080
leading scientist was Rafael mulam which

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,160
you maybe know and he initiated uh and

45
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,080
of course then motivated several

46
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,680
scientists all around the world uh to

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,719
researching to um researching the

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,239
properties of cannabis he discovered

49
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,400
endocannabinoid system and the use of

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,920
medical cannabis by using really

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,560
state-of-the-art biomedical biochemical

52
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:39,079
physical methods to prove that and um of

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,640
course also bioinformatic and based on

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,760
such a solid foundation there is still a

55
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,279
problem how to translate this knowledge

56
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:50,280
to clinics and um here um we have

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,360
problem here we have problems as we

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,560
already heard a little bit around and

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,440
these are the problems that are related

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,239
to the medical agencies and uh

61
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,598
administrative obstacles in many

62
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,158
countries also in Slovenia especially in

63
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:08,318
Slovenia I say and unfortunately and

64
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:11,158
also there is a problem with Medical

65
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:14,318
Society medical staff medical doctors to

66
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,519
accepting to even understand try to

67
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:20,000
understand the benefits of cannabis

68
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,879
although the science is really showing

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,519
that it has infect and we will hear

70
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,598
about that uh today so uh about talking

71
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,200
about the history I would like to ask

72
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:34,318
first uh of course the was used for

73
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:38,119
various diseases and I would try ask you

74
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:42,199
first David which diseases have been

75
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,759
discovered first to benefit from the uh

76
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,598
consumption of cannabis products in the

77
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,479
history and now it

78
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:52,878
is thank you very much Tamala well in

79
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:56,518
the history it is well known that um

80
00:03:52,878 --> 00:04:00,318
already the um especially Arabic um

81
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,200
mohamedan doctors were using cannabis

82
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,598
for different purposes but especially

83
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,919
for the seizures because at that time

84
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:13,078
for epilepsy there was no other

85
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:15,119
medication um in the in the end of 19th

86
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,280
century or in the beginning of the 20th

87
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,280
century first first medications were

88
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,319
bromides and soon after that

89
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,279
phenobarbitone and this was actually a

90
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,800
kind of help for these patients with the

91
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:36,119
severe um epilepsy problems

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:40,000
however um already um at the end of um

93
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,840
20th century there were some just few

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,399
reports about possibility to use

95
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:51,079
cannabis for the severe um epilepsy um

96
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,038
patients for those with um very

97
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:57,198
resistant epilepsies and at that time

98
00:04:54,038 --> 00:05:00,560
maybe we already had pharmaceutical 30

99
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,160
or even 35 drugs which were quite

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,918
effective but still one third of the

101
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,280
patients will remain um resistant to all

102
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:12,279
these uh

103
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:15,799
treatment so um I think pediatric

104
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:19,559
epilepsy was the first one to merge from

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:25,079
this medical cannabis um uh treatment

106
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,879
and it was in um 19 no in 20 2014

107
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:32,959
actually that the mother of young

108
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:35,560
Charlotte who had severe um early um

109
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:39,680
epileptic syndrome which is called D

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,280
syndrome um and she had for 200 or 300

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,639
seizures per day and she went to Stanley

112
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:51,198
Brothers in Colorado and she ask them um

113
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,400
if they can produce a kind of oil from

114
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,840
the cannabis for her daughter and it was

115
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:01,399
actually a miracle because um within 10

116
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,560
days of this treatment uh the girl um

117
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:07,799
has become nearly seizure free instead

118
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,839
of 200 seizures per day she had only

119
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:16,680
four or five per week um and thereafter

120
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:19,839
it came to the public um in some

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,199
newspapers and so on and from that that

122
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:27,399
time on um the research on um

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,199
cannabinoid a treatment for severe

124
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:34,598
resistant epilepsy started

125
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:40,598
um okay we have we have used um kind of

126
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:44,120
um canab canab Bol um from 2015 on so

127
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:47,598
this is for 10 for the last 10 years and

128
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,720
um already at this early years three

129
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:53,159
years after that we have um published um

130
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,319
a paper with a retrospective study and

131
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:02,319
we were astonished when we um uh analyze

132
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:05,000
the data uh 1 of our children was um

133
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,439
completely seizure free So 20% was

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,598
seizure were seizure free and um one

135
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:15,000
half of the patients they had only

136
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:17,560
occasional seizures so um it was a

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,399
remarkable result and and soon after

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,800
that also the other studies um confirmed

139
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,359
that yeah that's that's really amazing

140
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,439
especially for the families on Mothers

141
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,000
and especially then for the children to

142
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:36,879
that can grow learn and get into a

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,959
society now I want to ask you also if

144
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:44,639
this is um first disease that was FDA

145
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:47,000
approved also or were they others um yes

146
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,400
um the majority of the studies maybe I

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,240
can just uh show some

148
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:57,959
comparisons um here is uh one systematic

149
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,918
review um um and you can see that the

150
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,560
majority of these studies that is

151
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:07,639
um this is our study and there are also

152
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,800
many others um you can see that um the

153
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,439
results are um rather similar in all

154
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,639
these studies um and epilepsy is the one

155
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:22,079
which is the most studies however um in

156
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:25,560
Brazil and um in Israel and also in some

157
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,959
states in um America they were using

158
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,918
also for the other conditions especially

159
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,240
for the spasticity

160
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:40,278
for behavior problems in autism for um

161
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:43,839
severe sleepiness problems and for um um

162
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:46,838
pain of course pain is also one of the

163
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,120
um topics which is studies this is still

164
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:52,160
used now all over the world but not only

165
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,560
for children no no no no no it's for but

166
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:58,759
then um for Els the epilepsy is not um

167
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,838
treated with Canabis why is that um

168
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:04,480
unfortun well I'm talking about our

169
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,959
country in Slovenia unfortunately the

170
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,879
neurologist for adult persons they are

171
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:16,958
very rarely um using canabidol um even

172
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:19,320
if it if it has been proven um in also

173
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:23,199
in the uh double blind studies that it

174
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:28,680
is very effective and also this um uh

175
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,720
nice um uh guidelines are um giving the

176
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,599
this

177
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,120
recommendations that it should be used

178
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:40,079
as an addon drug not not as a primary

179
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,560
antipeptic but um add on Dr but um they

180
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,559
are not using it okay thank you oh you

181
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,000
want to no there is only one thing more

182
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,639
I would this this this is the summary of

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,159
these studies but um what I would like

184
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:58,240
to say also is that um there was one

185
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:02,039
study in done um which showed the

186
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:07,000
comparison between um purified canabidol

187
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:09,599
which we are using and um the extract of

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,958
cannabis which is um they're they're

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:17,519
calling it canabidol enriched cannabis

190
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:20,000
but however there is THC also inside and

191
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,360
as you can see this is our study and

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,480
these are the other study but um when

193
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,600
you use cannabis enriched preparations

194
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,320
the results are even better which is

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,440
which is to some extent it is normal

196
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,240
because then you have this ENT Rush

197
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,519
effect and all yeah we are coming to

198
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,519
that later on in the discussion with a

199
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:47,039
pharmacist but now I would uh move to

200
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:51,360
borut and uh first I would like to say

201
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:54,639
that uh uh first after China then also

202
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,639
this knowledge was transferred to a to

203
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:01,480
to the to the east practically to India

204
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:05,200
to the Syria to Persia to Greece to

205
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:09,440
Egypt and then it came also to Europe

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,680
actually first it came from India by the

207
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,920
uh medical doctor and chemist William

208
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,719
oon and he was um also working in India

209
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,078
for a long time transferred this

210
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,480
knowledge to England and there uh soon

211
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,638
after that it was already in English uh

212
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,079
pharmacopia and also in American

213
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,879
pharmacopia and uh even in

214
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,719
phopa as I learned today for several

215
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,759
several years until of course we all

216
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,000
know that a Prohibition came 100 years

217
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:45,439
ago about and uh since then of course

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,919
and now recently it's again in European

219
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,120
pharmacopia so what does it mean because

220
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,919
Slovenia will also accept European

221
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,919
pharmacopia how would this change the

222
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:59,559
attitude to prescribe Canabis to use

223
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,958
Canabis and especially among the doctors

224
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,759
well thank you very much first of all I

225
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,879
would like to thank to organizers for

226
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,720
giving me the opportunity to be here

227
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:12,600
andar excellent moderator as usual uh

228
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,278
well uh the same faces the same audience

229
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,519
second or third year but what is new

230
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,879
actually unfortunately not that many uh

231
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,278
I'm going to emphasize that I'm going to

232
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,000
talk as a pharmacist so I have to

233
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,240
Advocate uh some kind of pharmaceutical

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,278
legislation but on the other hand I

235
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,799
would like to put a very big black spot

236
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,639
on this regulation particularly in

237
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,919
Slovenia in order to move forward with

238
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,320
what we're talking about so you have to

239
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,958
know that scientific uh evidence are

240
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,720
something but uh clinical studies a

241
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,799
proof clinical studies recognized by FDA

242
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,959
or IM uh European Union it is something

243
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,559
different nevertheless we'll come to

244
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,239
this later on now uh finally we are

245
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,319
faced with the European pharmacopia

246
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,560
monograph on the flowers of medical

247
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:08,120
Canabis it was uh issued on July 1st

248
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:09,879
2024 so very very new document and yes

249
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,360
we have this document what does this

250
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,360
mean that all medical Canabis that is

251
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,320
going to be produced in Slovenia or

252
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,480
imported from any other country uh how

253
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,879
to fulfill completely fulfill with the

254
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:27,440
criteria which is in this monograph this

255
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:30,600
is good but let me tell you very recent

256
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,680
example one of from iCal uh company

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,800
wholesaler distributor ask so um this

258
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:41,078
company apply for the permission for

259
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,759
import a Canabis which Canabis medical

260
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,599
Canabis from bedran you all know that

261
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,879
this is the golden standard European

262
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,320
union and the monograph was prepared

263
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,399
according to the uh characteristics of

264
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,959
this plant which is very well

265
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:59,679
standardized with the content of 22% of

266
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:02,599
uh uh THC and other components

267
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:06,359
and what uh what was the answer from uh

268
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,800
agency it was a negative one why because

269
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,879
do not uh I mean the certificate of

270
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,399
analysis from the company that produced

271
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:18,039
this bedran uh there is a slightly

272
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:21,078
modification in the uh Ash residual Ash

273
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:23,879
and or zening but I mean we're talking

274
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:27,638
about 00005 instead of something like

275
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:30,159
that so extremely rigid and this is the

276
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,198
take-home message I

277
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,759
many times I emphasize this if there is

278
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,639
a will there is a solution is there a

279
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,639
will from the regulatory point of view

280
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,639
we're going to get the solution okay so

281
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,320
coming back yes this is fine we have now

282
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,278
monographs so all importers all

283
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,959
producers by the way about the

284
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:52,159
production it was excellently um uh

285
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:55,518
presented uh by um my colleagues from

286
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:59,319
Andrea from uh hope Institute uh yes we

287
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:04,278
are very close to the standardized uh uh

288
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,519
um plant uh however uh all producers in

289
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:09,078
terms of medical Canabis had to fully

290
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,159
fulfill good agriculture and collection

291
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,799
practice which is this the case so it's

292
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,799
impossible to raise the plant somewhere

293
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,838
in not controlled conditions this is

294
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,198
something that it is important you know

295
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,360
that we just passed with the referendum

296
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:27,078
uh it was very clumsy one but never mine

297
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,000
I mean the outcome is good so something

298
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,039
is important to know we have to

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,120
distinguish sorry this is not real

300
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,838
question but just to mention a little we

301
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,399
have to disting between uh medical use

302
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,120
and recreation use I'm am for both

303
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,240
however we have to to to to separate

304
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,440
this because of the conditions if we'd

305
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,240
like to have a raw material for the

306
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,240
final product in terms of medical

307
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Canabis we have to raise the plants

308
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,318
according strictly according to good

309
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,839
agriculture and uh and collection

310
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,198
practice which is not the case of the

311
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,120
recreation one so coming back okay we

312
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,958
have this one and on top of this U

313
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,560
medical agency uh for I mean sorry

314
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:10,719
Agency for medical products and medical

315
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:13,518
devices ask uh importers yeah or any

316
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,879
kind of I mean any individual to uh

317
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:21,318
provide a special for which is called

318
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:24,679
the um written request for the needs and

319
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:27,399
it was uh uh explained to us that there

320
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,679
are no need to produce or to export

321
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,600
which was also mentioned by

322
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,599
um Andrea uh that actually that the

323
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,639
needs are here I mean that the the

324
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,360
plants are already uh available at

325
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,839
oncological Institute let me go further

326
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,759
more because I'm quite upset on this

327
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,560
what is the document that agency is used

328
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,959
for one single document it is called

329
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,758
recommendation for paliative care for

330
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:59,719
oncological patients could you imagine a

331
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,440
recommendation this is the bottom level

332
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,679
in hierarchy of the documentation uh

333
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,679
they do not care about any kind of

334
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,798
international guidelines we have quite a

335
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,679
lot of guidelines and in this

336
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:14,038
recommendation there are only two

337
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,280
indications one it is a pain but the

338
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:18,240
Canabis is supposed to be the second

339
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:21,119
line medication not the first one in

340
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,318
this document at the second it is

341
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,159
prevent vomiting prevent no NAIA which

342
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,480
again means only two single indication

343
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,400
for the oncologic patient that are on

344
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,798
the pallative care so this it is a a

345
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,798
dust let's say if there is no wheel

346
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:42,000
there will be no no uh kind of of of uh

347
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:44,558
uh um um let's say some kind of

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,839
improvement so what about other diseases

349
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,879
neur neurological disease etc etc uh

350
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,879
okay I will stop it here and let me yes

351
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,159
because I have many questions one is uh

352
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,039
also for you about the role of

353
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:01,720
pharmacist in not only uh suggesting

354
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,200
call helping patients that are coming to

355
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,319
to the you know to the pharmacy and ask

356
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,519
for help but uh even more so what is the

357
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:14,720
role of Pharma industry are they um

358
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,960
somehow of course it's a competition are

359
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,880
they opposed against or can they perhaps

360
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,400
involve cannabis uh production of can

361
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,440
cannabis Pharma in their lines or is

362
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,240
that what what is the situation in the

363
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,880
market yeah well you know from excellent

364
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,440
question thank you tomor from Sil

365
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,159
industry it is not a carus or Red Cross

366
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,440
there is always uh profit behind and

367
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,080
from from Sil it is not oppose uh

368
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,360
preparations coming from Canabis but the

369
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:48,000
regulation it is extremely strict which

370
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,319
means that the pharmaceutical industry

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,480
has to uh perform clinical studies that

372
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,960
are extremely expensive then the whole

373
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,919
indications

374
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,720
are technology it is protected I'm

375
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,559
talking about cannabis it is protected

376
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,200
by patents so these are patents uh and

377
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,678
we we have these products for example

378
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,000
epidox which is composition of CBD uh

379
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,200
THC predominantly CBD um 10 to1 or 15

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,599
to1 something like that then we have

381
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:22,600
sativa it is finished product composed

382
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:25,558
of T THC CBD one: one 25 5 Mig so there

383
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:28,439
are products but due to the very strict

384
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:31,599
loation and patent uh protection it is

385
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,960
very difficult to penetrate this as a

386
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,558
product pharmaceutical industry it is

387
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,919
for a business let me uh uh implement

388
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:42,678
this to OIC you all know that this is

389
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:46,038
gp1 Agonist which is actually the only

390
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,679
indication it is treatment for diabetes

391
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:50,558
uh patient but due to the fact that very

392
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,360
pleasant side effect was found out that

393
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,759
this is the reduction of the weight uh

394
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,918
all of us we are seeking for this oamp

395
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,480
this is of label use actually and

396
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,759
Pharmaceutical industry under the table

397
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,640
produce a lot a lot of this kind of

398
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,119
compound because of the business of

399
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,960
course officially they could say no the

400
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,199
only indication in this one so this is

401
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,200
not not against but you know again it's

402
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:17,960
very and the other hand is this a real

403
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:22,519
profit uh if uh um several uh factories

404
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,440
are going to produce uh medication with

405
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:27,359
only two

406
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,919
indications uh which yeah exactly which

407
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:34,000
are actually the second line products

408
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:37,480
for Tre these indications this is really

409
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,319
amazing but what does this mean for the

410
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,558
patients and of course this is unethical

411
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,319
to the patients because they are um at a

412
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,599
declined of any treatment and then they

413
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,279
go to Black Market and you have good

414
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,639
experiences and maybe this case please

415
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:58,079
explain us what happened when suddenly

416
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,840
the import of uh uh of uh epidox was

417
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,439
blocked

418
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:06,959
yeah um we have studied a group of

419
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,679
children where parents came to us and

420
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,480
they were asking us um if we can analyze

421
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:17,798
these products which they bought um at

422
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:23,759
the black market for children and we did

423
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:26,759
the analysis and um this is what we have

424
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,759
found

425
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:33,879
oops so this is this is it now if I

426
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:37,959
finished before um with the slide where

427
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I showed that um cannabis enriched

428
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,679
canabidol is much more potent than

429
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,760
canabidol alone like pure canabidol or

430
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:52,038
isolated canabidol somebody would say

431
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:56,919
this is the slide showing um how

432
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:59,119
different um were um THC and CBD

433
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:03,038
contents in this

434
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,719
specimens you can see that um even um

435
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:09,240
the ratio sometimes was 1 to 100 that

436
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,440
means that um the children were giving

437
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,679
pure THC on one hand and on the other

438
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,519
hand there were products with um very

439
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,120
high content of CBD and there was no THC

440
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:25,158
so these were the products that the

441
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:28,038
parents were buying Black Market

442
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,960
in yes the parents were buying this at

443
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:34,599
Black Market Market we never ask them

444
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,278
where did they get it no however this

445
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:40,839
analysis yeah our Institute Yosef Stefan

446
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:45,038
did this analysis and this is what came

447
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:47,599
out and together with this um very

448
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:50,879
different concentrations of THC and CBD

449
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:53,639
and some of them they're quite dangerous

450
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,559
very dangerous and because you know that

451
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,159
when you have CBD together with THC the

452
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:02,240
CBD is counter of THC so there will be

453
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,559
not so much s effects and the other

454
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,440
thing was that there were a lot of heavy

455
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:13,038
metals and even steroids in these uh

456
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:16,080
samples so um these data unfortunately

457
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,679
were not published because the paper was

458
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,720
not accepted but I think this is I think

459
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,038
this is a very important message I hope

460
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,319
it will be so they can see how unethical

461
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:31,440
is to expose children or patients to the

462
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:33,079
black market def but uh I will now clear

463
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,400
something because we were talking and

464
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:38,359
maybe the audience is not really uh

465
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,919
knowledging this that we talk about

466
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,798
medical cannabis which is the full

467
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,038
spectrum as you said the broad spectrum

468
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,558
or full spectrum this differences and

469
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:52,079
the pure cannabinoids isolated and mixed

470
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:55,639
together and uh what is the difference

471
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:59,558
the as I understand this mixture medical

472
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:03,400
medicinal cannabis is hard to make uh

473
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:06,678
this this kind of therapy Therapeutics a

474
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,919
uh randomized clinical trials as is as

475
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,080
by The Doctors medical doctors for a

476
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,919
drug and ex for the drugs to be sold so

477
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,079
can you explain what is the difference

478
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,799
and how this we call this Entourage

479
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,918
effects of different cannabinoids

480
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:23,839
different terpenoids flavonoids in the

481
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,919
in this mixture extract of the flower

482
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,639
medical flow so what is the difference

483
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,520
and how to yeah thank you for this

484
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,919
question actually yes you are completely

485
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,839
right you know that uh well the

486
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,600
composition full spectrum composition of

487
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,038
the kabit extract it is composed not

488
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,119
only on canab there terpenoids or any

489
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,839
other kind of plant secondary

490
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:47,439
metabolites allow me to compare this

491
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:50,959
with the very well known remedy which is

492
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,240
uh it is sell like uh medicine now but

493
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,319
it was know for the centuries and this

494
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,278
is extract of valeriana of falis

495
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,398
valerian actually uh faculty of Pharmacy

496
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,640
University of Liana we perform some

497
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:07,759
studies but not only we all around the

498
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:11,440
globe scientists try to isolate um um

499
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:14,359
particular I mean uh um substances like

500
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,360
uh um ingredients you know that for

501
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:19,319
pharmaceutical industry it is much

502
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:22,599
easier to deal with one component one

503
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:25,359
compound one molecule uh due to the I

504
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:28,000
mean analysis control of analysis

505
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:31,158
standardization and so on okay so uh it

506
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,398
was point out that um okay what we

507
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:38,520
analyze so there were uh valerenic acid

508
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:41,519
um essential oil votr flavonoids if we

509
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:44,319
test not only we but uh this was the

510
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,879
Consortium yeah exactly uh All Around

511
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,158
The Blob uh the effect what what is the

512
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,320
effect what what is the supposed to be

513
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:56,799
effect um sedative effect

514
00:25:52,319 --> 00:26:01,319
um let's say some kind yes as a sedative

515
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:04,679
as an um uh um anti I mean antic and so

516
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,278
on we you know how valeriana is work

517
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:11,278
okay so we found out that not more than

518
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:14,359
up to 5% of this effect were exposed by

519
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,319
a single component separated separated

520
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,398
from the mixture exactly which means

521
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,158
that the mixture really works

522
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:23,239
pharmacologically

523
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,760
synergistic particularly the same it is

524
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,880
with the canavas extract of course we

525
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,960
have to be very precise on which kind of

526
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,120
indic we're going to to monitor or to

527
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,000
going but yes I mean in generally uh I

528
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,319
am I'm in favor to have a full spectrum

529
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,720
but you know what does this mean full

530
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:44,439
spectrum this depends on the mode of uh

531
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,880
extraction uh mode of application for

532
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,880
example uh then the growing condition of

533
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,320
the plant etc etc but it's possible I

534
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,640
mean what's the difference between full

535
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,918
and broad

536
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,679
spectrum um well we call full spectrum

537
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:03,679
if there is um th H C inside and um

538
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:07,080
broad spectrum if there are only non

539
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,240
psychoactive canab canabo so the TFC

540
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:12,480
quty is a difference between full and

541
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,679
Broad okay when I stay with you now and

542
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,360
go to the Future from the past to the

543
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,919
Future what is the future of using

544
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:24,000
cannabinoids or uh medicinal cannabis in

545
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:27,399
Neuroscience in neuro neurological

546
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,798
diseases what your vision as we have

547
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:35,439
been astonished by um canabidol use and

548
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:39,720
Effectiveness um using it in the

549
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,798
resistant very resistant um childhood

550
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:47,159
epilepsies we have been even more

551
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:50,720
astonished um using it um it also as as

552
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:53,399
as in in the case of epilepsy um also it

553
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,120
came from the parents they actually came

554
00:27:53,398 --> 00:28:00,319
to us and they asked them um why

555
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:02,518
wouldn't not what why would not try a

556
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,879
cannabis product that means full

557
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:11,599
spectrum that means canabidol plus

558
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:15,799
THC um in severe Behavior conditions um

559
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:18,439
of autistic children these were children

560
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:21,798
who were having a lot of different

561
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,798
antipsychotic drugs the the regular well

562
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:28,879
they're also um off label actually no

563
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:32,000
they are not meant risal for example and

564
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,120
Quin and so on so on but the parents

565
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,599
were coming and they said um each drug

566
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:41,398
of this anti psycotic we used it was

567
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:44,879
worse so why we will not try this

568
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:50,639
product and so we said okay we have um

569
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:53,799
um product um which is a CBD THC 10 to1

570
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,519
so that means 10 times content of CBD is

571
00:28:53,798 --> 00:29:00,278
higher than THC and um let us try this

572
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:03,079
and it was remarkable really because

573
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:06,240
these behavioral problems of autistic

574
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:10,918
children which can be very very serious

575
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,798
I have here a video I hope it will

576
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:16,600
go um you will not hear the voice

577
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:21,480
because the voice is awful but this

578
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:25,278
boy um he had this um temper

579
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:29,558
tantrum after seeing um through the

580
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:33,558
window that their neighbor park the car

581
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:36,359
not on the usual place but uh a place uh

582
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,879
beside and he got this temper Tantra

583
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,879
yeah this is typical upset yes yes he

584
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,720
was completely upset and this is

585
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,519
actually typical for this severe

586
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:52,079
autistic children and sometimes they are

587
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:54,120
also um Hing hurting themselves or even

588
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,158
the the family members and so on so this

589
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:00,879
is really and uh the results were

590
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:03,919
remarkable but not um only in our small

591
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,559
study that there were only 17 children

592
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,799
but there are um this year studies which

593
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,879
proved actually the same this is Maza

594
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,119
the the

595
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:19,120
Brazilian authors and Miller Val um the

596
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:24,038
doctor from Germany um she did a lot of

597
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:27,798
study on um toured syndrome and tick and

598
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:30,000
um cannabis and this is our own study

599
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:32,599
and and this is the first randomized

600
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,839
double blind PLO control clinical trial

601
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:40,439
on 60 children with this severe autistic

602
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:43,359
um problems and it also show they all

603
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,640
showed including ours that these

604
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:50,479
behavior problems these severe behavior

605
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:53,640
problems can be um really overcome um by

606
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:58,558
um cannabis and um at the end I would

607
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:02,080
just say um that um one of our families

608
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:06,798
uh the boy is now 17 years old and they

609
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:10,240
said after so many many years um um of

610
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:15,599
trying different antipsychotic drugs uh

611
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:20,240
we have now um time um when we can sit

612
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:23,719
outside together and have a coffee um um

613
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,120
in peace um and we are really very happy

614
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,079
because sometimes you need just a little

615
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:31,359
bit you know but for this parents that

616
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:35,079
means a lot this is the quality of

617
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:38,079
completely changed quality of life they

618
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,119
can go outside and they can they can sit

619
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,398
together and you predict that this will

620
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:47,678
be taken the CH the child's or yes yes

621
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:49,918
yes I I think his life in

622
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,120
yes thank you this is really an

623
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,519
experiment and I think uh it's

624
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,959
astonishing that also you found this out

625
00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:00,278
as many others and it will be probably

626
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,120
also going to be approved by FDA or uh

627
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:06,240
our agency our agency what do you think

628
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:09,119
about that our agency based on this data

629
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,480
approve such a

630
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,638
treatment so tell us something about the

631
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,038
suggestions how to deal with that well

632
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:20,000
um I do believe really I do believe that

633
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,839
we're in front of uh something which is

634
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,480
is called a final goal final goal of all

635
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:30,519
of us and this is that the patient will

636
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,278
be able to get the prescription to go to

637
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:36,599
the pharmacy and to get this or that

638
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,960
product based on the flowers of medical

639
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,278
Canabis uh I do believe that at the

640
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,079
agency that now they have all

641
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,000
documentation which is needed for

642
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:51,359
production or for not for let's say for

643
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,558
uh importation and it is stupid to ask

644
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:57,278
uh about the number of patient that need

645
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:00,558
this one you know uh there is estimation

646
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:03,599
from examp from National Institute of

647
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:07,319
Public Health it is estimation that

648
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:12,119
12,000 only concer patient are regularly

649
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:14,480
use uh medical Canabis uh and uh well

650
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:17,079
and the answer from agency was there is

651
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,720
no need what it is needed it is on the

652
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,798
oncological Institute again this is the

653
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:26,519
combination and this is the comparison

654
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:29,000
that only uh cancer patient are eligible

655
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,480
again to to get yeah to to to get this

656
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,119
so the final goal will be to come to the

657
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,240
pharmacy now this is impossible uh on

658
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:38,199
the other hand well not why Pharmacy not

659
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,038
because I'm pharmacist but everything

660
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,000
should be regulated in the whole

661
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,879
production chain from the beginning to

662
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,119
the end let me uh Implement something

663
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,840
that I many times I try to uh to give

664
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,398
this example and please try to

665
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,720
understand me correctly for example if

666
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:02,759
you get a bacterial lung infection what

667
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,440
will be your first uh step to go to

668
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:08,398
doctor and then to get a prescription

669
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,440
with what antibiotic right and the de is

670
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,759
going to be then delivered to you in the

671
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,519
pharmacy why not look at this why not as

672
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,720
soon as you think or you know that there

673
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:22,119
it is a bacterial infection why not to

674
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,598
moisture one piece of the bread put on

675
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,480
the uh uh in front of the of of the

676
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,480
window and went for 24 hours there would

677
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,639
be enough aspergilus and penicilium

678
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,039
molds that spread the surface of this

679
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,639
bread believe me there's plenty of

680
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:41,159
antibiotics inside why because you do

681
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,878
not know the dosage you do not know the

682
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,240
safety and it is very inconvenient and

683
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:49,480
very ugly to eat this kind of molded

684
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,398
bread so you trust that the final

685
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,519
product with antibiotics which are

686
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:55,159
produced on the same way they not put

687
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,079
okay bread somewhere but mean I'm

688
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:00,320
talking about G&amp;P but at the end of the

689
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:04,079
day this is the same so trust the final

690
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,800
product but allow patient to get it

691
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,079
that's the the goal of the regulation

692
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,480
and I hope as we met karagi this morning

693
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,640
that the new legislation will be uh

694
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,240
adopted soon of course there will be a

695
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,559
lot of discussion but we uh are coming

696
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:24,358
to this and based on the oncologic

697
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:26,199
patients uh also the uh Society

698
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,159
Association of oncologic patients in

699
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,598
Slovenia is strongly supporting this

700
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,799
movement and I see in the audience Anna

701
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:34,640
liter who is the president of that and

702
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,960
congratulate for all the efforts that

703
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:41,440
you are doing to this patients get a uh

704
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,320
meaningful uh meaningful advice at least

705
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,720
from the doctors thank you and so I

706
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:52,039
think we are uh rounding up this session

707
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:54,838
and so I um emphasize here that to catch

708
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:57,880
up with the global advancement in

709
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:00,559
Slovenia we really must do Foster first

710
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,079
collaboration between science Academia

711
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,318
and clinics on one hand and Industry on

712
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,119
the other hand and this is clearly what

713
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:10,358
for what we show for what we show so

714
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:14,559
foster the uh collaboration between

715
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:17,318
Academia and uh clinics industry on one

716
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,440
hand and also this should be supported

717
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:20,960
financially but public private

718
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,920
partnership and this would be more

719
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,039
profitable than anything and of course

720
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,920
we have to be open also to International

721
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:32,239
uh Financial networks to to get support

722
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,680
for this kind of research because so far

723
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:38,439
most of the research was done based on

724
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:41,318
the support of the Pharma companies and

725
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,039
uh the public money in Slovenia nowadays

726
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:46,519
is spent for prohibition first and then

727
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:50,039
how to prove the drugs are toxic so the

728
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:52,280
department of Toxicology in our clinical

729
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,559
Center University clinical Center is

730
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,680
working intensely on that and making

731
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:59,759
seminars and webinars on these topics

732
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:02,759
not mentioning the Cannabis can also uh

733
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,920
help cure some disease or at least help

734
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,720
the symptoms to disappear so also this

735
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,559
regulatory um experts and agencies

736
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,639
should work independently of the

737
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:16,759
politics or

738
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:20,199
ideological obstacles whatever they are

739
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:23,079
and uh so I think that we will soon get

740
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:26,000
to that hopefully but we will try to get

741
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,400
that uh with all our efforts and try to

742
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,280
get more people involved in in our uh

743
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,119
cannabis uh research development and so

744
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,640
thank you very much for your attention

745
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,800
for this all right let's hear it for our

746
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,559
panelists now I want to some questions

747
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,800
we definitely have time for questions

748
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,719
questions questions I'm coming I'm

749
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,318
coming I'm coming over I don't need I

750
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,439
don't no we need we need to

751
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:57,000
hear yeah I hear you I

752
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,838
can thank you um so we was talking now

753
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,400
about anzing

754
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:09,719
of the quality and the the percentage of

755
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:13,160
cabs in uh cannabis plant so my question

756
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:15,399
is uh how big is the problem with

757
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:18,199
cannabis plants

758
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,358
diseases and using of pesticides

759
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:26,239
herbicides and other use of chemicals in

760
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:28,838
uh farming so uh when you analiz uh

761
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:32,519
those uh

762
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:37,279
samples um is there

763
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:43,400
uh did you find uh something there can

764
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:48,240
harm uh the uh the health uh of using uh

765
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:51,838
because obviously uh Farmers uh have uh

766
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:55,118
to use some chemicals they do so uh I

767
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,440
need I would like to have this answer

768
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,640
and please one another more can I answer

769
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,000
answer this first okay so you are

770
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:04,639
meaning diseases of the plants and I

771
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,599
think that Andrea would be the best uh

772
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,239
expert on this because she's dealing

773
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:12,760
with plants and Andrea do you have any

774
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:15,118
data on the plants uh viruses infection

775
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,119
plants uh cannabis blant viruses

776
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,760
infection or bacteria or whatever or the

777
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,358
pesticides the

778
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,240
harm okay uh thank you yes there are

779
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:27,960
some uh infections of course with

780
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,559
viruses varat in hemp plant as well uh

781
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,280
they can be treated let's say with heat

782
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,119
treatment or cold treatment it's more

783
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,079
complicated like so we cannot spray

784
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,240
against it uh but there are not allowed

785
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,800
let's say plant protection products in

786
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,838
ham production which are let's say uh

787
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,200
registered but there are some which can

788
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:50,039
be used for

789
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:52,199
ecological um growing so there are some

790
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:55,358
um let's say ecological products which

791
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,078
can be used against uh fungi against

792
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:01,159
some let's say predator mites which can

793
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:04,039
be used to uh to uh to strict or to

794
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:06,279
control the other mites and so on so

795
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,880
there are strict regulations what can

796
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,599
you what can you use but there are not a

797
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,000
lot of them uh which is a general green

798
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:17,119
deal in EU not to use PL protection

799
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,400
products as much as we can on Market on

800
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,519
on the market products I don't have the

801
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,800
I just know what are what can be used in

802
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:27,800
plant in hemp growing purp for medical

803
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,960
purposes yeah but I don't know what what

804
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,519
is if the question is what is going on

805
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,400
on the market I don't have those data we

806
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:40,759
have some regulations we can be sure

807
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,519
that we can what we buy on the market

808
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,240
for

809
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:49,519
regulation

810
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:52,118
is regulated is good use there's some

811
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,199
institut or will be

812
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,358
some I don't know if there's a lot of

813
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:59,759
regulations on the European side on

814
00:40:56,358 --> 00:41:01,440
pesticides and and and whatnot uh right

815
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,480
now maybe maybe we can ask our

816
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,159
pharmacist are there well uh just just a

817

shortly well actually you know now uh

823
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,000
due to the fact that we have this

824
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,160
monograph uh there it is also one

825
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,838
section about the pesticides so as soon

826
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:29,960
as you are going to fulfill this you are

827
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,400
free I mean you are on the safe side so

828
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,119
don't worry about this now before it was

829
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,519
the responsibility of the producer but

830
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,358
again there is a general legislation in

831
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,800
Europe as was said uh which pesticides

832
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:45,279
are permitted currents and so on so on

833
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,560
but yes now we have this so what is your

834
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,280
second question please uh may I just add

835
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:53,838
this before we are going forward so if

836
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,400
if you buy let's say uh the the hemp so

837
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,400
cannabis with ecological biological

838
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,200
certificate before you get it you have

839
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,480
the control there are a few uh let's say

840
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,799
organizations in Slovenia which are

841
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,559
doing a sample so U blind sampling of

842
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,200
the samples they are doing the analysis

843
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,599
and you cannot get the certificate if

844
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:16,279
you're not following the regulation so

845
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,880
there are few uh few institution which

846
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,760
are covering this so you cannot get

847
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,960
their certificate very easy thank you

848
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,559
and the second before we get to your

849
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,039
second question let's uh we'll get this

850
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,559
one are you're good okay thank you so

851
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:31,599
much okay thank you and

852
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,720
um hi hi good day I have one question

853
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,800
for Professor David uh we are producer

854
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,719
of CBD oils for many years now and um

855
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,280
one parent with uh with a child who have

856
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,399
who is your patient come to us and ask

857
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,119
for

858
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:52,160
advice uh and we created one oil which

859
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:55,400
is 30% of CBD 10% of

860
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,879
CBG and uh in beginning we had some

861
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,838
positive results but then

862
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:07,599
we try to create something better then

863
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:11,480
we add U terpenoids 1% in that oil so

864
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:15,079
after that we get uh way better results

865
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,920
so my question is do you have some data

866
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:20,920
some knowledge about uh terpenoids that

867
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,680
can help to calm the child because we we

868
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,800
know that let's say the the meren and

869
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,598
Alpha and beta pinets are doing good job

870
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,800
for now but I think that there is more

871
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:37,800
room to enhance those um those U

872
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,599
medications but still we are still doing

873
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,920
that under like

874
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:48,599
Cosmetics uh we are doing that regulated

875
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:52,880
it is really pure it's by GMP hccp and

876
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,599
ISO controlled uh it's it's pure about

877
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,240
uh you know I understand those questions

878
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,920
that that people are asking and also

879
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:03,399
Blake Market is um can't create that

880
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:08,039
kind of Purity we can provide but my

881
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,920
question is what can we do in boundary

882
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,679
of the

883
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,358
regulations now we can do only like

884
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,598
cosmetics and of course you you you

885
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:20,679
suggest to the parents how they can use

886
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:24,440
it better way uh what can we do more to

887
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:25,879
help the the the patients thank you yeah

888
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,039
thank you very much for the question it

889
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:32,760
is actually difficult question um we do

890
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:36,039
know that um FL flavinoids and

891
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:40,240
terpenoids and so on they they have a

892
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:43,000
very good effect um either I it can be a

893
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:46,399
calming effect or um just the opposite

894
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,559
no and um Professor rouso the famous

895
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,200
neurologist who he did a lot of studies

896
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:56,359
with these different

897
00:44:51,199 --> 00:45:00,239
Kars um and with the different um uh um

898
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:04,799
extracts of um um different terpenoids

899
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:09,399
concentration inside and um it really um

900
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:13,680
um sometimes um it adds um the effect to

901
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:17,039
the canabidol and to THC um and

902
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:21,719
sometimes it can completely change um

903
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:24,719
the the the effect however um we are for

904
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:28,558
the time being we are not um able to

905
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:30,519
analyze it and um even it it will be

906
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,480
very difficult because we are always

907
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:36,318
calculating the dose according to the

908
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,920
patients's um age and the patients

909
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:45,800
weight um however but calculating only

910
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:48,760
canabidol and THC um if um if we would

911
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,200
go further and include the terpenoids

912
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,960
maybe it will be in in the future it

913
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:59,480
will be definitely um um something much

914
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:02,599
more effective clinical studies or so I

915
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:06,519
think we are late uh and we have some

916
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:06,519
time we have some time we have like two

917
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:13,639
minutes hi I'm Andrea petre I'm the CE

918
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:16,800
of alos BPR and hammed Pharma together

919
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:19,358

of Hamed Fara I want to ask you a

921
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:27,119
question uh Professor borut we have done

922
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:30,640
in Poland and in Romania CBD as elimary

923
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,640
supplement do the government of Slovenia

924
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,440
accept on mutal recognition to notify

925
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:38,118
this product at

926
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,240
supplement uh well no uh the answer is

927
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:43,720
no why because simply CBD is still uh

928
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:47,159
you are talking about CBD right uh yeah

929
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:50,639
we speaking about the full extract full

930
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:54,279
CBD you know that efca uh this is still

931
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:57,598
pending situation with uh efca regarding

932
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,640
the CBD it is CBD is supposed to be a

933
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,318
dietary supplement or a Noel food at the

934
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:07,000
time being it is not clear answer due to

935
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:08,800
the fact that uh the agency not I'm not

936
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,159
talking now about the agency for

937
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,440
medicine product but about the uh some

938
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:15,920
kind of unit dealing with dietary

939
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,240
supplements uh they are very strict in

940
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,960
terms of all regulation in terms of

941
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:24,598
European Food Safety Authority uh it's

942
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,960
not still uh any kind of decision

943
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:30,480
whether CBD it could be a diory

944
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,519
supplement uh so now which means that's

945
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,000
why it was said that it was like a

946
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:37,920
cosmetic this is the the mimics right we

947
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,280
all know but this is the only way at in

948
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,240
Slovenia according strictly according to

949
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,240
the legislation of European s Food

950
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:48,959
Safety Authority uh CBD is supposed to

951
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:53,879
be a novel foood because it was consumed

952
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,440
after 1970 uh 97 so uh I would say no

953
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,200
but try

954
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,639
