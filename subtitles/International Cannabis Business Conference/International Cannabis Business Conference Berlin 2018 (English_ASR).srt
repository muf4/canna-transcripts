00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,839

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,920
marriage of activism and and business we

covering all different kind of aspects

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,600
of the new cannabis Market I think we

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,238
can really benefit from from the

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
experiences that different countries

16
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,238
have already with a medical cannabis I

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,439
have to actually pinch myself that we're

18
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,159
at a Cannabis Conference a global

19
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,518

00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,798
is growing this industry in Germany has

22
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,039
the potential to be the second biggest

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,280
cannabis Market in the

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,960

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:19,839
hours and um they're asking the right

27
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,279

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,599

[Music]

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,840
we have huge potential here in Berlin

33
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:41,840
and we have many creative and talented

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,040
people who have already established a

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,680
very vibrant startup ecosystem I think

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,320
the longevity of what Berlin has to

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,320
offer is going to set Alex and set

38
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,219
Berlin up for um a great prosperous

39
