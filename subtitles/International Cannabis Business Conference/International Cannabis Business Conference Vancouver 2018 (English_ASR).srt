2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,718
for us to be at this point in beautiful

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:15,099
Canada is a hell of a thing and it was

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:17,320
not a thing that happened overnight the

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:19,509
information is insane it's entertaining

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,189
and the networking is some of the most

7
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:25,390
phenomenal networking in the cannabis

8
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:27,789
industry worldwide people are fascinated

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,800
by this industry that is the experience

10
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:32,380
that is how we start bringing new

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,759
consumers to it that's how we start d

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,250
stigmatizing it cannabis is part of the

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:43,929
good part of this whole damn century

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:45,880
finally starting now it's time for us to

15
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:48,100
come out of the closet as people who use

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,370
cannabis for pleasure and to manage our

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,450
stress as we go about doing business we

18
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:54,609
might just have a little more

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,320
consciousness it's possible that working

20
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,759
around and with this medicine may be

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,490
that we bring a little bit of higher

22
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,219
consciousness to this industry it's just

23
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,198
so much opportunity on educating people

24
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:11,560
and really doing some some brilliant

25
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:13,329
things that bring them closer continue

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,430
to be cohesive in the fashion that we

27
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:17,709
have to advocate for a better industry

28
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,130
not to forget how we got here and to

29
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:23,679
continue in that spirit of collaboration

30
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:26,199
it's up to teachers and professionals

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,090
and parents to step forward and to say

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,460
yeah I use cannabis I use cannabis daily

33
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,310
and I'm a highly functioning person the

34
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:36,339
good part starts with you and I the good

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,920
part starts with normalizing legalizing

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,250
and decriminalizing cannabis all over

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,250
the world
