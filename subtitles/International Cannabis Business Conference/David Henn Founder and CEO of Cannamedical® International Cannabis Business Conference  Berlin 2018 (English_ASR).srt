the demand upon May 2018 we can do so

21
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,459
because we found very strong new

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,620
partners around the world we were

23
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:27,199
searching for the highest medical

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,490
cannabis standards we could find we are

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,930
very we were very pleased to announce

26
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:32,449
two weeks ago that we are cooperating

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:36,980
with the Canadian Canada based company

28
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:40,520
Matt relief that is multi that holds

29
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:43,310
multiple prices for the quality of their

30
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:48,019
cannabis today so most of you came here

31
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,820
today because your investors you are LPS

32
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:51,349
around the world you are very interested

33
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,259
in to Germany easily because it's the

34
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:57,049
biggest cannabis market in the world

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:00,230
/ today one year after the cannabis law

36
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:06,049
was established in Germany we are facing

37
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:09,560
an amount of 15 tons a year today we do

38
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:12,709
this with 60,000 patients that are

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,590
splitted within the three to peer health

40
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:19,120
insurance system which equals the

41
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,310
private insurers people which are

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,650
represented by 20,000 patients we do

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,060
have 10,000 patients that are public in

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,310
Swart that enjoy the full cover

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,439
of health insurance for their medical

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,989
cannabis medication and we have another

47
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,150
very third very big third group that is

48
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:40,140
very often missing this is a private

49
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,760
payer group so they don't do the way

50
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,439
through the health insurance companies

51
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,068
they don't apply for for the cus

52
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:50,359
coverage they just paid for themselves

53
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:52,979
and besides Germany's even the highest

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,430
price market in the world which is a

55
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:59,250
problem and we do see solution solutions

56
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,049
coming quite soon for those of you who

57
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,370
don't know a price of medical cannabis

58
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:08,840
today in the pharmacy equals around 20

59
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,340
to 25 euros per gram which is a lot

60
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,129
compared to what actually is charged in

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:19,769
Canada what is also very interesting

62
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:23,340
number for the investors that are

63
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,319
participating in in this speech the

64
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,640
German cannabis market according to

65
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,869
Forbes equals up to 18 billion euros and

66
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,399
revenues over the next three years

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,620
that's a massive number when I just

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,390
heard the number two days ago that

69
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,819
actually during the last two years

70
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,629
Canadian LPS were getting investments

71
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:49,289
over the last two over the last year a

72
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:52,289
1.25 billion dollars investments and the

73
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:54,120
number of LPS in Canada is growing every

74
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:57,239
single day my health Canada just

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,180
improved increase their their staff by

76
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,719
300% which is quite a lot so we are

77
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,299
positive that over the next the next

78
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:09,620
time we will have sufficient supply to

79
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:16,858
also serve other European Union

80
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:18,358
countries that are opening up I'm

81
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,029
convinced that most of you are very

82
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:24,359
interesting regarding one question how

83
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,638
do I import into Germany and this is a

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,979
problem so we hear a lot of rumors

85
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,150
around around the world we speak we meet

86
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,490
up with a lot of people and we speak

87
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:36,329
with a lot of people so actually what is

88
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:40,370
required is to have a German GMP or an

89
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:43,318
equal GMP from a European authority

90
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,389
by today we only have Germany that is

91
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,319
that allows the import so pretty much

92
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,879
Germany is your door open I into Europe

93
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,189
we do have four companies on the market

94
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,259
and I'm very proud to tell that

95
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:58,348
kinematical is the only company that is

96
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:01,288
acting on a privately owned basis so we

97
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:03,569
are we do not sell ourselves to any

98
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:06,478
Canadian LP or any other LP in the world

99
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,710
yet we do so because we strongly believe

100
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,649
that the market is just at a very

101
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,089
beginning stage the huge potential and

102
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:16,829
economic potential is just at a very

103
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:18,388
beginning and as we have a big big

104
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:20,908
market for flowers today

105
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,889
I'd be 100 percent sure that it will

106
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:26,098
change quite soon and we will also get

107
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:32,939
into more into oils more into extracts

108
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:35,579
more into into sprays capsules oils but

109
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,740
this also requires in Germany clinical

110
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,628
studies that's not that easy whenever I

111
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,030
speak with Canadian companies or other

112
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:45,419
LPS around the world there was asked me

113
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:47,989
one question can I import flowers can I

114
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:50,189
import creams can I import import oils

115
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,528
unfortunately Germany is a big dip is a

116
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:55,288
bit different if you would like to

117
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:59,129
import oils to Germany today this will

118
00:05:55,288 --> 00:06:01,769
require a clinical study or the option

119
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:04,889
to is we let the pharmacy do it

120
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:08,579
that means we import we are able to

121
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:11,639
import oil as a bulk material this is

122
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:16,620
one option the other option is as for

123
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:19,379
example Turay does it that the pharmacy

124
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,810
does the final final mixing within the

125
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,960
pharmacy this is this is a very very

126
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:28,769
easier way to do it but in fact we are

127
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:34,318
not able to import finished all products

128
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:36,810
today same goes for capsules kinematical

129
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,789
itself is serving a growing network of

130
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:44,490
roughly about two thousand four masses

131
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:46,800
today we do so through a very high

132
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,079
skilled sales team that is doing a

133
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,908
fantastic job every day the German

134
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,379
market mechanism for those of you who

135
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:55,259
don't know it yet

136
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,060
is very simple the patient goes to the

137
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,310
doctor gets a prescription for medical

138
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,290
cannabis goes to the pharmacy the

139
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,920
pharmacy orders at one of the importers

140
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,439
or distributors for medical cannabis

141
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,860
once once we did so we hope that we are

142
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,819
able a quite soon to send to send out

143
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,860
our delivers within only 24 hours at the

144
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:21,360
time that's that's the definite goal

145
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,840
quite soon we're over will can America

146
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,819
invest over the next two years up to ten

147
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,379
million euros into research and

148
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,899
development which is a very very big

149
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,089
number for us we do so with a strong

150
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,489
belief that actually the clinical

151
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:38,310
studies will allow us to import more

152
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,490
products for a broader range of products

153
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:47,370
and that we are able then to serve

154
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:49,920
German patients better some of you have

155
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:54,329
seen recently can America's patients ID

156
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,129
card we established this ID card to give

157
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:59,099
patients for the first time in history

158
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:01,079
the option to actually demonstrate in

159
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,810
whenever they get into a police control

160
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,569
that they are illegal cannabis cannabis

161
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,180
patient we have a very very big problem

162
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,610
in Germany when it comes to comes to

163
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,769
police controls because we get told a

164
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,470
lot of stories that probably takes it

165
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:18,810
away from from our patients we don't

166
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,630
like this so we'd like to actually

167
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,149
commit ourselves and give a great

168
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,699
support to those patients that this is

169
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:29,399
no longer happening the patient ID card

170
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:33,149
can a medical office today is free of

171
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:35,459
charge meaning you can just audit at

172
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,918
your pharmacy and have the opportunity

173
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:45,389
to get it get it delivered within two

174
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:48,419
day time zone so that's it from my side

175
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:49,740
I'm very happy to answer any kind of

176
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,949
questions that are coming up from your

177
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,950
side

178
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:01,408
[Applause]

179
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,159
Germans are so efficient your 30-minute

180
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:13,159
speeches take ten minutes that's great

181
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,419
are there oh that's the question back

182
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,419
here there you go all right

183
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:32,000
yeah it's it's Francesca here from

184
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,150
Empress pharmaceutical Switzerland

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,139
actually the question is you really

186
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:43,220
think that in the next years Germany and

187
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:47,179
Europe Italy Spain won't be able to grow

188
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,430
up the cannabis we can say they need for

189
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:53,599
their patient and they will still need

190
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:57,620
the import we can say the buds from

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,779
Canada from the US from Uruguay or the

192
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,490
Canadian companies are growing up in

193
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:07,490
Portugal because I mean you mentioned as

194
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,519
well for the price that the retail price

195
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:14,360
is actually 25 years Graham which is

196
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:18,289
really unbelievable we really huge price

197
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:22,129
actually because we both know how much a

198
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:25,730
gram of buds of weed we can say costs in

199
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:27,740
the end of we can say production okay we

200
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,060
can consider as well the packaging we

201
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,560
can consider the logistic delivery and

202
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:37,099
everything you want but actually to

203
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:39,529
reach 25 euros is a long way you know

204
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,269
what I mean well I agree with you I

205
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,480
agree with you in in two points actually

206
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:46,789
Germany we all aware of the German

207
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,529
theory that was fully messed up but I

208
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:50,750
agree with you that Europe will be will

209
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:54,379
be able to serve itself from inside

210
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,759
Europe 100% so when I said when I'm

211
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:58,429
speaking about import it does not

212
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,360
necessarily only mean that we are

213
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,449
imported from Canada

214
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,370
it means we're also continuously

215
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,460
evaluating opportunities this includes

216
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,620
Portugal and other European Union

217
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,670
countries that are just opening up I

218
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:16,580
fully agree with you yeah yeah yeah as

219
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:19,579
well another thing actually you said

220
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,580
that for import you need the GMP license

221
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,000
yes the ISO and everything I mean in

222
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,550
Europe if you have the GMP license yeah

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,309
you can ABS absolutely grow up as well

224
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:33,709
so the same companies are buying the

225
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,809
stuff from you actually in the next

226
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,470
year's

227
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:41,139
we'll be able to grow up themselves so I

228
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,778
mean actually as well for the pricing I

229
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:46,778
was mentioned before there will be a lot

230
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:49,480
of companies in the business so I think

231
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:52,450
that I hope as well that the price will

232
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,190
getting lower as well because it'll be

233
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,580
not it's not just business this is

234
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,200
medical you know it means you just

235
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,790
beware the price I mentioned then price

236
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,650
the pharmacy charges to a health

237
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:04,360
insurance company it's not the price

238
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:09,549
kind of medical or any other important

239
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,169
charges to a patient this is way lower

240
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:12,939
as most of you know the German

241
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:15,519
pharmacies add up to a hundred percent

242
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,950
of the price they are pelling they are

243
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,949
there so they are paying to a wholesaler

244
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:33,100
thank you I have actually two questions

245
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,920
the first one is from which other

246
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,379
countries are you planning to import in

247
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:44,289
the near future how is the perspective

248
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:46,330
perspective on this area and then the

249
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,009
other question is if I understood

250
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,440
correctly

251
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:57,669
Germany is only allow you only to import

252
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:59,860
flowers right today yes yes I believe

253
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:03,399
this has to do with a regulation that

254
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:08,100
will perhaps change and then you cannot

255
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:11,279
say anything about when and how will all

256
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:15,970
be imported or if it will be possible

257
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:19,179
but I wanted to know what do you know so

258
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,850
far about that about importing further

259
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:25,329
than the flowers and then if you can

260
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:29,110
tell me anything else about the clinical

261
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,759
studies that are required okay so if I

262
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,190
got you right I got your right you asked

263
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,110
for questions the first question is from

264
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,020
which other countries are we evaluating

265
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,700
to import to Germany so these are the

266
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,319
big ones all of you are familiar with of

267
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:45,129
course we have an eye to Israel of

268
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,740
course we are having a partner in Canada

269
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,740
already of

270
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:53,240
we are speaking to people in Portugal we

271
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,528
see a continuously growing network of

272
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,240
producers that are just coming up and

273
00:13:55,528 --> 00:14:00,450
it's the best thing that can happen to

274
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,149
the German patients because just on your

275
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,720
side sorry we are just delivering

276
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:08,750
December orders which is a way too long

277
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,860
the second thing you asked me is

278
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,980
regarding the oils and clinical studies

279
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:19,440
well if you want to sell it in Germany

280
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,970
as have fully finished medicine it

281
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,980
requires a clinical study the problem

282
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,720
with clinical studies is once you do it

283
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,649
you only do it for one disease let's say

284
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:33,750
we did we start a clinical study to show

285
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:35,639
the mechanisms regarding depressions

286
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,570
then is only valid for depressions if we

287
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:42,439
do one for pain it is only very very

288
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,410
precise and cost intensive to do so for

289
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,240
for pain patients and the third question

290
00:14:46,409 --> 00:15:01,679
if I got you right can you repeat the

291
00:14:48,240 --> 00:15:05,669
third one actually I don't remember no

292
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:08,099
problem yeah the clean the clinical

293
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:10,639
studies he already answered that okay

294
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:16,860
yeah so they were very constant answer

295
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:19,110
you're so efficient mr. Henn you

296
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,700
referred to clinical studies and I was

297
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,889
just wondering what standard of clinical

298
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,930
studies you refer to are they european

299
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,199
medicine agency are they european food

300
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:30,750
agency which clinical studies are you

301
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,180
imagining for the new finished oil

302
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,190
products we are just into a stage where

303
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:37,528
we where those clinical studies get

304
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,800
designed so i will be able to tell you

305
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:43,049
more precisely about the way we will do

306
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,909
them in the next six months who who sets

307
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:46,949
the standards it's not your company it

308
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:49,649
must be a european we're working we're

309
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,278
working with a company we know for quite

310
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,019
a while

311
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,639
that doesn't dis clinical studies

312
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,610
together with us they have experience of

313
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:00,088
15 years in doing so even for the big

314
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,949
pharma industry we will read

315
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:04,620
sir the first clinical study within the

316
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:06,929
next 90 days so it's a private company

317
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,179
it's not a European agency do you have

318
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:12,419
any product that you sell currently that

319
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:16,638
has european medicine agency approval

320
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,639
for the clinical study that it's done

321
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,499
again you will understand that we will

322
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:24,269
come up with the design of the clinical

323
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:26,970
study and all the information I can give

324
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:28,709
you within the next 90 days and it will

325
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,449
be a very big announcement in a very big

326
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:36,929
step for cata medical cost intensive

327
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:40,078
step hi just one that addition to the

328
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:43,229
question before you are only talking

329
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,349
about importation inside the European

330
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,199
Union is the Latin American market

331
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:52,639
opening up also for this possibility we

332
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:56,669
got some relations to growers of

333
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,409
cannabis in Colombia for example is

334
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:02,778
there a possibility to get those

335
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:02,778
products into Germany in the near future

336
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:09,209
indeed we we have we get contact from a

337
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,980
lot of growers around the world so we

338
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,929
continuously evaluating opportunities

339
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:17,009
and see how realistic this opportunity

340
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:18,720
is Colombia is one of them and the

341
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:20,640
problem we have with Colombia is today

342
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,459
is a bit uncertainty regarding if

343
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,169
Colombia will establish a cannabis

344
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,509
agency regarding the UN Convention of

345
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:30,929
1961 but we are positive that this will

346
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:34,319
happen on one way or another during the

347
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,940
next next month s or years and Colombia

348
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,308
will actually become an opportunity for

349
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:44,730
us of course it's very attractive due to

350
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:50,250
the pricing structure and we we were

351
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:52,048
very happy and excited to test or do you

352
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,210
start the start dialogue with our local

353
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:59,099
authorities to see if we will actually

354
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,899
be able to import from Colombia good my

355
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,449
question is regarding product

356
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:05,639
development at Cana medical so first

357
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,890
part would be are there any plans to

358
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,870
develop a private label brand and then

359
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,420
secondly how do you decide which strains

360
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:14,299
to source and

361
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,980
potencies of the strains I can promise

362
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:18,230
you today that we will have a private

363
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,900
label on the market on one way or

364
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,579
another within the next 12 months this

365
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,880
is just a logical consequence

366
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:27,679
so today kinematical is the based on the

367
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,350
importance and products on the market we

368
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,850
are the only company that has that is

369
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:34,399
importing in am Advil even under an

370
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:36,289
American label but this definitely Golan

371
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,890
our list and we will follow this with

372
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:41,690
great interest and also she I think she

373
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,840
has to how do you decide which strains

374
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,029
to use is there a selection process your

375
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,379
help me just go this is the dank yes so

376
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:50,420
what I can promise you today is that

377
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,030
kind of medical is even the only company

378
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,880
that will be very transparent regarding

379
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:58,069
varieties regarding tripping profiles I

380
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,560
know that there are a few companies on

381
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:02,000
the market that make a big big secret

382
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,980
out of it but we are not afraid of it we

383
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,990
will promise that the varieties will not

384
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,490
change format relief products it will be

385
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,620
standardized it will be always the same

386
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,960
if you order in January in March and

387
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:13,429
April it will be very standardized you

388
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,360
will get full access to the chirpin

389
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:19,759
profiles you will get full access to any

390
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,729
kind of information you will need from

391
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,379
can America it would be great if you

392
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,079
could share a little bit in terms of

393
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,140
like the how does the import actually

394
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,849
work storage security safety and what

395
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,930
sort of regulations are in place there

396
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:38,929
or a post of you from the government so

397
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,370
an import actually is a very difficult

398
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,430
thing first you need security for

399
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:45,019
transport I just give you an example we

400
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,360
also had insure ourselves against

401
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:51,289
missile attacks this is a very out of

402
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,789
reach thing yes so we have this still

403
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:55,190
you need and you need to ensure that

404
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,839
your cannabis is for example temperature

405
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,850
control all over the wait when it's on

406
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:01,609
the plane meaning your need and you need

407
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:04,549
temperature tracking for 48 hours that

408
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:06,649
are there working independently so we

409
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:09,289
can see that the and at no point of time

410
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:12,050
the temperature tracking was beyond or

411
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:14,180
above a certain level that we have we

412
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:17,629
defined then you have the security

413
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:20,029
problem because whenever we pick up a

414
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,090
product from from our Canadian partner

415
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:24,629
this is very very high security risk

416
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:27,329
like this is cannabis worth

417
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:30,000
multiple million dollars so that's

418
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:31,829
another factor then of course it goes

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,390
hand in hand with lab testing the German

420
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:35,309
government would like to see that the

421
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,930
cannabis that we import match it at any

422
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:39,059
point of time the German cannabis

423
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,460
mammography which for example is a very

424
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,339
big problem when it comes to THC

425
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,890
specification the german cannabis

426
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:49,859
monography allows an deviation of up to

427
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,830
10% plus minus from it from a registered

428
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:55,529
THC level if this is not fulfilled at

429
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:57,779
current imported to Germany then of

430
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:00,690
course we have a stability studies for

431
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:03,660
for packaging to show that actually the

432
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:07,230
products table for 6 9 or 12 month and

433
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,960
in India in its packaging it's a very

434
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,019
quite complex process we get into and

435
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,130
once the product here is in Germany we I

436
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,490
can assure you we have a very

437
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:21,270
high-security vault on 900 square meters

438
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,640
that even includes food police control

439
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:26,339
we have a fire brigade direct cameras

440
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,170
into the vault and we are shipping from

441
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:30,629
products from there is very central in

442
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:33,300
Germany that's why it costs twenty four

443
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,010
dollars a gram this is what actually the

444
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,659
the pharmacy is charging the health

445
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:42,119
insurance company because they are up to

446
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:45,200
hundred percent yes we have one in

447
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:48,750
Germany today is very central Germany

448
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,480
located so we are able to as long as we

449
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:56,640
have supply to deliver any product

450
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,799
within 24 24 hours time zone yes ok so I

451
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,560
have to question one question is on the

452
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,059
licensing as it sounds there's a lot of

453
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,879
problems that's why there's only four

454
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,129
people that are probably importing on

455
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,650
the other hand it sounds like you you've

456
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,830
solved all the problems so it's possible

457
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,090
so it's possible and of course probably

458
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:17,970
you don't want to come out with it

459
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:19,919
because you'd like to stay on top being

460
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,230
one of the only importers because you're

461
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,610
making profit of it right well we are

462
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,559
first we are not afraid of competition

463
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,899
first of all I see a lot of faces I know

464
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,509
that certain over you are already

465
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,280
working on on licenses and certain of

466
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:34,710
you are already working on a very big

467
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:37,529
opportunity Kara Medical has solved this

468
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,370
problem as a very early-stage important

469
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:40,079
distributor

470
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:42,359
I think the biggest and then I get this

471
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,379
question quite often because how is it

472
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,149
possible that only four or four

473
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,970
companies serve the market today it's

474
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,759
very easy it's more cost intensive as

475
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:54,120
you believe it's more regulated than you

476
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,769
believe and I just very honest I believe

477
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,658
some of them just give up in the middle

478
00:22:55,769 --> 00:23:00,509
of the process because it's just killing

479
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,278
their capacities however I'm pretty sure

480
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:03,298
more will join us and this is good this

481
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:05,400
way we're not afraid of competition

482
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:08,700
we're very excited to start a good

483
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:12,840
dialogue with those of you that make it

484
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,788
to get a license well and we will see

485
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,349
well there's end up ends up but there

486
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:20,429
will be new companies in the market I'm

487
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:23,548
very sure at some point okay thank you

488
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:26,250
and and probably we can talk to you as

489
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:27,990
well during the seminar tonight at the

490
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,109
parties where you will be and you will

491
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:34,829
probably help us on some more questions

492
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:37,528
and the next question is you're not

493
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:40,859
doing any CBD products right yes it's

494
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:43,140
correct just THC just THC for a very

495
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,788
simple reason we were discussing like

496
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,100
how this kind of discussion was a week

497
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:48,839
with our our sales team that that is

498
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:52,379
asking me when at what point of time we

499
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,418
will start doing CBD products the thing

500
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,010
is I will must sword a sword competition

501
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,630
with an Amazon trailer or wholesaler

502
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,109
very easy because it's not from it

503
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,940
doesn't have a pharmaceutical quality

504
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:05,639
mechanic an America is in an ongoing

505
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,860
process to do a lot of due diligence on

506
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,110
CBD producers but without being

507
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:12,599
disrespectful to anybody so far none of

508
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:15,000
them has has ever matched medicals

509
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,980
quality standards so at the point in

510
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,140
time we will find one that actually

511
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,870
successfully finalizes our digital Joe

512
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,788
Jillian's on them I will also do Sibley

513
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:29,699
products yes of course but they need to

514
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:33,538
be pharmaceutical quality okay and the

515
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:36,659
last one is I hear that you are

516
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:39,288
interested very much in doing this and

517
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:42,000
making this business work for the

518
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:45,298
consumer and the patient yes

519
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,890
any other because I there's it's been in

520
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,798
the papers you're the one of the first

521
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:53,070
ones and you made a bunch of profit

522
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,489
this year already and if you've been in

523
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:58,470
the papers any other goodness

524
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:59,369
any other goodness from you to go back

525
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,519
to Henry Roland's

526
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:05,668
except just the patient's idea that your

527
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:12,509
company is putting into social projects

528
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:14,399
or anything else yes so we are working

529
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:16,980
very close with the with the city of

530
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:19,008
Cologne where cologne based company so

531
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,249
we have certain social projects ongoing

532
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:25,950
with the drug support on a local basis

533
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:30,419
this is a very big topic for us we were

534
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:33,440
just contacted by another group that we

535
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:36,139
are supporting now this is a social

536
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:41,070
school for light libel

537
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:42,868
this handicapped kids which is a very

538
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:46,019
big problem because we have an S so

539
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:50,548
called non kit non cats policy because I

540
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:55,349
strongly believe that that THC products

541
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:58,230
and kids in certain cases is a good

542
00:25:55,349 --> 00:26:02,579
decision but it's very tricky and very

543
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:04,528
difficult also we are you just asked

544
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:09,599
about other projects we have besides the

545
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:10,858
patient ID card there are a few in the

546
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:18,509
pipeline and you will hear them very

547
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:20,278
soon hi you spoke about how difficult it

548
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:22,108
is to import cannabis there's just one

549
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,839
wondering about the length of the

550
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:28,230
process so how long does it take to get

551
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:31,048
a license how long does it take if you

552
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,358
apply to increase your cannabis supply

553
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:36,118
out from the point the application is

554
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:37,858
made until it's approved and then I'm

555
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:39,538
also interested if you could tell me

556
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:44,418
what happens when there's a supply

557
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:46,739
shortage does the pharmacist contact the

558
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,850
importer if you could just tell me a bit

559
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:51,269
about this process

560
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:54,928
so these these are two questions so

561
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:57,089
first to answer is the whole process for

562
00:26:54,929 --> 00:27:00,419
importing cannabis it's a very complex

563
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:02,199
process because they it requires in any

564
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,879
case to have

565
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,288
certification if this is a foreign

566
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:08,408
company German companies don't produce

567
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:09,989
yet I can tell that we were working for

568
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:12,249
the last seven months very strong

569
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:13,929
together with our Canadian partner met

570
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:15,308
relief to help them getting the GMP so I

571
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,139
know what I'm speaking about we have

572
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:19,418
them getting it we've been involved

573
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:22,558
through the old process I've several

574
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:22,559
times over with a big team

575
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:28,089
it worked successfully so watch out for

576
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:33,129
the news two weeks I don't want to get

577
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:36,189
deeper into it to set up the process

578
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:37,839
itself regarding a transport logistic

579
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,470
transport this is not the big the big

580
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:44,259
thing that you just defined actually

581
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:46,269
shipping waste transport waste just that

582
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:48,220
as any with any other important export

583
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:51,878
company as well the second questions you

584
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,440
had is how do we treat pharmacies and

585
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:56,019
whenever we have shortage on the market

586
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,399
it's pretty simple if I cannot deliver

587
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:59,858
them they keep ordering we have a

588
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:02,439
waiting list but again this will change

589
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:04,358
from May 2018 on because by this time

590
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,038
you will be able to guarantee tour

591
00:28:04,358 --> 00:28:07,689
pharmacies that we can actually serve

592
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:09,849
every patient as your own eve of medical

593
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,830
cannabis because we have very very good

594
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:14,469
contracts we have a very good relation

595
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:17,608
build-up with our supplier Network and

596
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:20,259
network about that guaranteed

597
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:23,009
kinematical to have shipments at least

598
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:25,210
every 28 days

599
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:26,409
I'm mr. Han very interesting

600
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,980
presentation thank you for the

601
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:29,049
information

602
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,399
just a couple of quick questions you

603
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:32,710
said and if I heard you correctly that

604
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,268
you're delivering product from orders

605
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,230
from December that the waiting list was

606
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:37,839
that long I don't know if I heard

607
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,220
correctly so maybe we can clarify and my

608
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,628
question is about your relationship with

609
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,450
med relief is it an exclusive

610
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:44,949
relationship or are you also able to

611
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,359
work with other suppliers from Canada

612
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,889
and are you interested in bringing some

613
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:50,220
of the other products like their gel

614
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:53,439
caps or the cream thank you

615
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:58,210
so my relationship with matter leave

616
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,179
this is a very very long term good

617
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:06,038
relationship so we import med relief on

618
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:08,340
an exclusive basis nevertheless as long

619
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:12,700
as my relief can deliver the amount we

620
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:15,939
request them six month and begin before

621
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,590
I promise that we will always mess that

622
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,960
Iman but still I'm free to choose any

623
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:22,028
other partnerships so if one of your one

624
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,889
cab wants to come up with suggestion

625
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:26,249
we're very happy to receive them at any

626
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:26,248
point of time

627
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:42,969
next question Becca can I hear it cuz I

628
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:45,369
mean you're us so the question is all

629
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,288
around yes oh is it we are delivering

630
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:50,189
currently do some work products but

631
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:53,858
again like this will all change in me

632
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:56,080
sorry thank you hello hi

633
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,730
so my question is all around oils in the

634
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,528
first is a point of clarification and

635
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,499
then the second is a question so I think

636
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:05,019
you answered this woman's question here

637
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:08,950
and you said that at present you can

638
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:10,690
only import flour into Germany but

639
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:13,179
previously you had said that tilray is

640
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,269
actually importing oils into Germany so

641
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:20,379
can you clarify that I said that it's

642
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:22,089
true so we have two oil products on the

643
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:23,738
market today one is so from buy America

644
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:25,959
they produce it locally in within

645
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,548
Germany with material from Austria and

646
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,940
then we have the children's that are

647
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:32,499
imported from Canada so I think what it

648
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,080
would have didn't highlight when it was

649
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:39,730
saying I'm sorry for the confusion so we

650
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:41,648
are able to import oil but we have a

651
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,009
regulation Germany that that requires

652
00:30:41,648 --> 00:30:49,209
the pharmacy to do the final step before

653
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:52,419
the the patient will be able to receive

654
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,778
it the process therefore is different

655
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:58,960
it's a it's a reception 'el from

656
00:30:55,778 --> 00:31:00,749
surgical medicine that's the big

657
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,889
difference the classification matters

658
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:07,720
you are not able to send it to Germany a

659
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:11,288
finalized oil bottle let's say of 10

660
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,389
milliliters and get the doctor prescribe

661
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:16,388
it for four depressions or four for pain

662
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:19,388
bag or something so from from what we

663
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:21,579
know is that the pharmacy receives

664
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:24,158
extracts for example from from by Norika

665
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:25,839
they add up certain oils and forfeiture

666
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,830
rate they bring up

667
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:32,618
big better bigger bottles classified as

668
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:34,058
bulk material but there's no way you can

669
00:31:32,618 --> 00:31:36,428
actually trade it the same way as an

670
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:38,408
aspirin for someone okay and then my

671
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:40,119
second question is still around oils is

672
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:41,859
it's my understanding that there are

673
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:44,558
different types of oils that you can

674
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:46,808
then extract or different levels of

675
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,239
extractions so you could just ship over

676
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:51,940
a raw oil or winterized oil or the

677
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:54,639
distillates for example and are there

678
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,989
any rules or regulations or any sort of

679
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,878
themes that you're seeing in terms of

680
00:31:55,989 --> 00:32:00,460
which types of oils are being imported

681
00:31:57,878 --> 00:32:02,829
as a raw material my knowledge today

682
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,869
they are not limited but I would like to

683
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:07,449
get back to you with this question

684
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:09,459
we could just have a quick conversation

685
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,679
afterwards the speech I would like to

686
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,838
answer this I'm sure you'll be able to

687
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,929
have more talking in the hallway

688
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:19,329
sure as people are want to do there was

689
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:24,249
a guy there he is over here why are you

690
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:36,460
so far away I've already reached my step

691
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:38,499
limit on my Fitbit thank you hi good

692
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,479
morning my question is around you said

693
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:42,069
you're importing flowers now and you

694
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:44,859
also said these are pharmaceutical grade

695
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:47,138
so how do you reconcile ads with the

696
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:48,579
variability you have with flowers do you

697
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:51,939
might repeat the question you said that

698
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:54,009
you're importing flowers yes and that

699
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,479
these were pharmaceutical grade because

700
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,788
you're making farms use good great

701
00:32:55,479 --> 00:33:01,298
products yes how are you controlling the

702
00:32:57,788 --> 00:33:03,308
variability that's inevitable or I can I

703
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:05,769
can promise you that that not only as

704
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:07,229
our control ongoing controlling the

705
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:09,868
quality but also the German authorities

706
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:12,489
meaning we do have a very complex

707
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:13,718
testing methods set up so every import

708
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:15,639
comes with an individual release

709
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:18,788
certificate that allows you to track

710
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:20,439
every THC level CBD level absence of

711
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:24,608
heavy metals absence of contamination

712
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:27,129
any kind malt it's a very very broad

713
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:35,588
testing that it comes up with what every

714
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:38,319
single import we do but also by beyond

715
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:39,638
the the governmental restrictions we

716
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,398
have established a kind of medical

717
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,168
quality code so the product the product

718
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,939
we import does it does also have to

719
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:48,759
match the kinematical quality code code

720
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,489
and this is for example has lower limits

721
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:54,190
for DTC where variety than the

722
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:57,190
government allows us so kinda medical is

723
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,259
very ambition to import only or import

724
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,720
very standardized cannabis that always

725
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:05,278
have the same quality under the same

726
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:09,068
level of THC and CB

727
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:11,818
hi I am thank you very much for the

728
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:17,259
presentation I have two questions one

729
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:20,139
question is regarding your contract with

730
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:22,990
a beef farm yes the bonus opium Stella

731
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:26,608
yes so you have annual amounts that

732
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:29,259
you're allowed to import Germany already

733
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:33,068
somebody asks you can you increase those

734
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:36,159
amounts and then um how long are you

735
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:37,898
guaranteed to be able to import that

736
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,720
amount for a year

737
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:45,368
indefinitely it's their time limit to my

738
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:49,298
knowledge this is an this is an

739
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:51,369
unlimited time frame and also I'm very

740
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:52,690
happy to tell you that also to my

741
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:54,210
knowledge kinematically is the company

742
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,440
with the highest

743
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,778
quantities that are permitted in the

744
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,409
market today to do so we had we went

745
00:34:58,778 --> 00:35:03,400
through a very complex

746
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:06,009
validation with the beef farm we had

747
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,630
approve them and several we had to get

748
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,950
them very deep into our contracts to

749
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,048
prove that we are actually able to

750
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:14,139
deliver those hormone amounts because

751
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:15,989
it's not so easy for a country to every

752
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:18,578
time increases the amount of companies

753
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:21,009
country is allowed to import because

754
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:22,839
whenever let's say I request some more

755
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,270
turn more twenty jobs at the beef farm

756
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:29,500
and they are deliverable it requires be

757
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:32,288
fun to go back to the UN health council

758
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:36,369
based on Vienna to raise the the overall

759
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:38,799
quantity for Germany okay so responsible

760
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:41,559
that is mentioned in the clan and fragra

761
00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:45,269
from the Lincoln yes that required to

762
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:45,269
import ten tons in the future

763
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:52,609
let me put it that way I promise that we

764
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:53,809
will be able to match the demand from a

765
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,410
on okay

766
00:35:53,809 --> 00:36:00,500
my last question every man might be and

767
00:35:56,409 --> 00:36:04,099
do you repackage in Germany or you get

768
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,650
the final product package from Canada

769
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:07,309

this is a follow-up question on your

774
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,449
quality control things from the earlier

775
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:22,730
question so is it fair to assume that

776
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:25,339
you're getting an external audits for

777
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:28,670
from FDA for example or is it all

778
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:31,100
internal control what is it if I mean

779
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,960
you you explain to your control SS on

780
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:35,630
the quality yeah do you get external

781
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,429
audits on this we do have external

782
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:42,610
audits we're working on going with

783
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:46,579
external quali qualified qualified

784
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:48,079
control consultants but not because

785
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,069
we're forced so big were just easily

786
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,049
because we want to be the best company
