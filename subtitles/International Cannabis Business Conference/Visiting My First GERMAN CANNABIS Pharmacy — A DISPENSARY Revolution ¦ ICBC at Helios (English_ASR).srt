co-founder of Helios cannabis and I'm

14
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,878
the brain behind the Cannabis section

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,879
and uh the Cannabis concept for the

16
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:53,759
store here and how long has the store

17
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:55,718
been open right in the heart of mic so

18
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,358
the store open uh we opened the store at

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,120
the 19th of February I guess this year

20
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,079
so um just of months so thanks so much

21
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,079
for giving us the tour it was so cool

22
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,798
one thing that was really interesting to

23
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:12,280
me is that it reminded me of Harbor Side

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,240
uh dispensary back in Oakland like about

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,159
15 years ago because You' separated you

26
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,239
have you have a separate area for for

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,719
cannabis and as far as I know uh that

28
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,879
you're one of the first people if not

29
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,798
the first to actually do that and if not

30
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,519
the only ones to do it now and of course

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,960
that reminds me of a a dope uh harbor

32
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,280
side was the dopest California

33
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,679
dispensary back in the day so what how

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,560
did you come up with that uh uh concept

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,320
MH yo uh this concept um has their

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,560
rootings uh when I joined oam University

37
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,599
back in 2016 you went to oam I was an

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,680
Alum at sterdam U big up oer Dam shout

39
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,519
out Dale yes and Jeff yeah um so if

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,079
you're willing to get some knowledge in

41
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,920
cannabis so because you went to

42
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:56,359
oaksterdam and you took their classes on

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,519
dispensary you were dispensaries you

44
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,718
were able to then incorporate that into

45
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,920
the pharmacy model for Germany and make

46
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,519
it more efficient than than it would be

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,359
if you were just normally you go to the

48
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,959
counter and you can the same people go

49
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,439
to the counter who want cannabis or not

50
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,199
Canabis so that has to be a little bit

51
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,680
cumbersome or confusing at times I'm

52
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,238
sure do the Cannabis patients need a

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,080
little more time for example exactly

54
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,239
like that yeah so we started um when

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,239
with cannabis with a normal Pharmacy um

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,000
a little bit um outside of Munich and we

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,080
had exactly um this type of situations

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,400
uh that we always had problem when it

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,800
comes uh those type of patients come

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,719
together and we decided that we need a

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,719
secondary Pharmacy where we just

62
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,919
focusing on the on the uh distribution

63
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:45,479
of cannabis and since I joined uh oam a

64
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,158
few years ago um that is something I

65
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:51,479
always wanted to bring up with and um

66
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:54,439
I'm I'm really glad that my uh business

67
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:57,399
partners um are following my vision with

68
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,400
that and um put their heart also into it

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,280
like I do and bring cannabis

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,640
to the people and uh spread the love for

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,039
cannabis and the the special needs you

72
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,119
can get out of can you giving me [ __ ]

00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,479
Goosebumps right now I'm serious man

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,360
this is the revolution in in Germany it

75
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,798
really feels like something special is

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,879
happening what you guys are doing is

77
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,360
Cutting Edge Leo uh what do you do here

78
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,959
with us I'm Leo I'm one of the pharmacy

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,400
owners and the second one is missing

80
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,479
today it's Stefan our senior partner who

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,719
founded the first Farm where we started

82
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,598
all the things in back in 1996 so um

83
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,438
yeah and so what do you do do you do you

84
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,639
do formulations also yeah not only but

85
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,639
we are specialized in doing formulations

86
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,839
so it's not only the the flower itself

87
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,238
but we can do a lot of different type of

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,959
formulations um we can do extractions we

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,840
can do mechanical separations um with

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,479
the with rosin that we get from there

91
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,280
for example we can do other stuff like

92
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:01,119
nalin we can do Olio gels all kind of

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,878
topicals but in all based on medical Bas

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,879
that is dope homie so so so two weeks so

95
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:11,719
unfortunately 2 weeks ago you guys got

96
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:14,878
raided by the Bish uh police and they

97
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,279
came in and they took your your H your

98
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,839
your hash extraction and the equipment

99
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,719
and all the equipment freeze dryer and

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,198
all all kind of stuff that all because

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,400
the Wasing system was too

102
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,280
heavy it out but um yeah but they took

103
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,079
it all because they said that uh doing

104
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,918
all that kind of formulation is against

105
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,918
the current law cannabis law which was

106
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,079
released or implemented in April 1 of

107
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:44,240
April this year um but we are a pharmacy

108
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,680
so actually we have the right to do all

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,120
kind of formulations not only with

110
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,959
cannabis but with all kind of medical

111
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,280
stuff we can do cocaine eye drops we can

112
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,439
do

113
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,399
ketamine much harder drugs you can do

114
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,519
these formulations but for some reason

115
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,359
they said you couldn't do it with that

116
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,879
with thatman law that was implemented in

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
April is split into two sections one for

118
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:11,038
the consuming part for normal P normal

119
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,080
um uh people that are private consumers

120
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,038
that are

121
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:19,079
ERS home C this is the consuming part of

122
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,240
the law and then you have the medical

123
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,839
part of the law where you get the

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,400
wholesalers Distributors producers and

125
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,719
pharmacies loc so they said you were

126
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,638
going against some

127
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,199
consumer really yes that's that's what

128
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,400
theyy consumer if I'm at home and I do

129
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,919
any kind of extraction it's

130
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,879
forbidden that's clear but as we do it

131
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:42,120
here we have the prescription from a

132
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,399
German physician so here we are which we

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,560
had which we had exactly so here we are

134
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,198
in the pharmacy that's not the private

135
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,879
space right so all we do here is a

136
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,879
something that we do in the pharmacy and

137
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,639
all kind of formulations that we do are

138
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,759
medical formulation so um that's what we

139
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,960
don't understand why they why they yeah

140
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,240
it doesn't so it sounds like you don't

141
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,680
have to be the world's greatest German

142
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,160
lawyer to understand that that sounds

143
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,400
like they're doing a little making a

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,039
statement maybe a little bit showing you

145
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,918
know how they feel about it or whatever

146
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,879
however um as we know in the states when

147
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,399
this stuff happened before then this is

148
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,598
a good time to obviously take it to

149
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,439
court uh when the law looks at it

150
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:20,719
objectively it sounds like you will win

151
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,199
your case even though it's a lot of

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,840
money and a big hassle to do it but you

153
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,680
boys could set uh a clear precedent for

154
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,198
Germany and is that what you guys plan

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,639
to do yes definitely definitely have to

156
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,800
they don't uh give us another option

157
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,240
because uh they try to charge us with

158
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,800
complete wrong law we can't say okay you

159
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,000
did a you did a mistake let's do it like

160
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,038
that because when we don't say no

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,839
against those type of uh it is a fraud

162
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,800
they try to do um when we don't do

163
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,758
anything against this who will it and so

164
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,439
we got a big up the Helios boys right

165
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,598
