Nathan hi uh I'm Nathan Kroger I'm with

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,159
rad Source Technologies we are a medical

47
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,320
eight years ago expanded into the

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,038
Cannabis industry and our equipment is

49
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:13,000
used to sanitize cannabis flour

50
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,878
primarily so that um people can pass

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,318
microbial testing and reduce risk for

52
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,039
people who have compromised immune

53
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,878
systems really diverse set of panelists

54
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,199
but I think one thing that we can all

55
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,759
relate to is the idea of forming

56
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,359
Partnerships uh I wanted you raise your

57
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,079
hands if you ever been in a bad

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
partnership in business or in your

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,920
personal life in your life reflect on

60
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,239

00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,919
cackles I remember doing events with

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,360
some with a team and uh on one project

63
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,878
and you're like gosh I can't believe I

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,280
got into this boat we need to get to the

65
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,399
other side of the lake so I can get out

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,598
of this boat as soon as I can um to

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,640
start about um strategic Partnerships

68
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:54,439
Sunny cultivators is working uh as a

69
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,878
project manager on 12 um different

70
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,680
companies that have different parts of

71
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,840
growing as part of the world horta

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,080
center how did that project how did that

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,560
partnership come

74
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,920
together um there was a need for um

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,439
research in cultivation and together

76
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,158
makes it more affordable for everybody

77
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,359
so they asked us to help them setting

78
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:18,158
that up and bringing companies

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,440
together um is it just a lot of meetings

80
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:24,039
did you have to meet people and befriend

81
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:25,840
them and RN them to your side or yeah of

82
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,359
course that is a part of it but it's

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,158
really like uh all have the goal in um

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
creating new knowledge and sharing that

85
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,158
knowledge so we are still in the

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,439
cultivation of cannabis it's still a

87
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:41,158
young industry we all need to learn um a

88
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,000
lot still and making it more uh

89
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,560
professional one of the key things is

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,919
genetics so uh one of the partners is an

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,799
F1 uh CCH is a breeder with um F1 hybrid

92
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,158
seats which is completely new and that

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,840
could be a game changer so we want to be

94
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,959
up front with that and knowing what is

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,438
happening in that field Desiree you been

96
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,239
doing indigenous Partnerships strategic

97
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:07,438
alliances in South America can you take

98
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,560
us inside some of those experiences and

99
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,438
talk a little bit about how forming

100
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,840
Partnerships with indigenous communities

101
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,280
has been different than in some of the

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,560
like at a broader level with Western

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,478
worlds or with countries exactly

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,600
well being the president and of and

105
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,439
co-founder of the foundation for hum

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,560
kindness and compassion which is the

107
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,319
nonprofit company or Oran organization

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,720
that we have Alliance and we're forming

109
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,599
a strategic alliance with these

110
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,639
indigenous communities now the main

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,360
problem with that one is

112
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,478
because the each country they have their

113
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:51,160
own laws but the indigenous people also

114
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:54,560
have their own laws actually one of our

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,479
experiences is what we had with uh

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Colombia one of the community there were

117
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:06,319
in yeah shout out Colombia right yeah I

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,240
think lcky is agreeing with me yeah yeah

119
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,120
and uh because of the laws that they

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,360
have which is so different from whatever

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,840
the FED I'd call it Federal Colombia one

122
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:24,879
yeah um it took our proposals at least

123
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:29,399
three years and within that it's still

124
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:31,360
like fighting within the community so

125
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,560
yeah we're really having a hard time

126
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,000
putting that together but at least in

127
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,680
some of the other indigenous communities

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,120
that we have like in Peru and in Mexico

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,160
and Jamaica at least with that one we

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,439
don't it's going slow it's really very

131
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,319
slow because of that reason but we're

132
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,719
it's GNA it's going to happen can you

133
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,280
just Google Colombian indigenous laws or

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
do you have to go there and be like what

135
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,599
are your laws own yes you got to go talk

136
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,600
to them yes yes what are those

137
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,639
conversations like oh it's did you go to

138
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:10,039
Colombia and like go yeah actually we

139
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:12,918
had one uh um big meeting and proposal

140
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:17,279
when we did our first proposal with the

141
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:19,839
NASA community of C Kaa uhhuh uh that's

142
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,198
in Colombia actually there's two

143
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,879
indigenous community that we have in

144
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:30,560
Colombia one is the Koji Community for

145
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:33,159
the uh Tanga and the Sierra Nevada

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,639
um so the three years one is the one

147
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,759
that's happening with the Cowan yeah you

148
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:44,079
know and you go in there everyone you

149
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,800
know the leader the women the leader of

150
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,758
the women are there too because I also

151
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,840
wanted to go and start Mental Health on

152
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,319
there because uh every time all of this

153
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:59,918
strategic um uh alliances that we have

154
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,240
with each indigenous communities we

155
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:06,680
really want to attend to their health

156
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,519
and not only you know not only just the

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,079
health but it we want to develop all the

158
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,560
businesses that they have that is fit

159
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,959
within that Community you been working

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,478
on this like new understanding of

161
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,318
cannabis trying to change mindsets

162
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,000
around the healthfulness of it do these

163
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,879
communities see it that way or are you

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,079
reorienting them I mean I imagine a lot

165
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,120
of Colombian communities have been

166
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,598
really impacted by the war is one of a

167
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:33,038
really good um thing that you brought up

168
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:37,759
up because this um with not only

169
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:40,318
Colombia but uh Peru Mexico and even the

170
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,120
Jamaican with the rust Safari in there

171
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,199
because we're also involved with some of

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,879
the rust tafari

173
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,759
Community they they are in they can they

174
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,960
use cannabis they grow cannabis anything

175
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,639
like that and they understand the

176
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,120
spiritual side of it right and that's

177
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,560
what I want people to understand you

178
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,519
know whether we use it medical or

179
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,478
recreational we have to understand we

180
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:10,439
have to be in relation and vibrating

181
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,598
together with the consciousness of that

182
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,560
plan yeah and they do understand that

183
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,680
and that is something that we want to

184
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,240
really bring the uh and change the

185
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,400
mindset of each and everyone George over

186
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,560
in Germany we're seeing

187
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,038
decriminalization and the beginning of

188
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,120
further medical

189
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,560
legalization um are you looking at

190
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,918
Germany are you looking for new

191
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,440
Partnerships in Germany how is your how

192
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:35,639
is your approach to this year and next

193
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,440
year going to

194
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,360
go yes everybody's are looking at the

195
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,640
new legislation in Germany this year

196
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,159
they decriminalize flour we expect by

197
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,600
the end of the year to allow extraction

198
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:50,000
that will bring a lot of business into

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Germany because currently all the

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
products that come in Germany are either

201
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,319
extracted in Switzerland or all around

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,879
the world um absolutely this is going to

203
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,040
be the cracking point of the entire

204
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,679
Europe because because everybody's

205
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,799
looking after Germany and France as a

206
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,078
major leaders of the EU so that is

207
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,559
essential to see that

208
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:13,399
change uh who what do you need on the

209
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,399
team do you need anything to expand in

210
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,079
Germany well um if we talk about

211
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,560
Partnerships of course you first look at

212
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:24,879
the holes of your organization and try

213
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,278
to fill them with uh the resources that

214
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:32,679
you don't have usually Partnerships are

215
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:36,240
formed like if you read the main uh the

216
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,120
the books for Partnerships the uh that's

217
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,039
what it says but uh really what

218
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,360
partnership helps is to save money from

219
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,719
tax and from investment so these are the

220
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,879
major things of of uh building

221
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,200
Partnerships so yes we're going to be um

222
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,559
partnering with uh companies in Europe

223
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,560
to provide systems to start uh

224
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,359
extracting to start processing the best

225
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,919
way possible and that's going to be

226
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,519
Mutual effort of course yeah to minimize

227
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,078
the expense what types of Partnerships

228
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,839
are you looking

229
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,120
at well

230
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:15,079
there're different Partnerships let's

231
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,879
say marketing Partnerships they um marke

232
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,519
yeah that's one of the uh is better to

233
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,759
find a marketing partner in Germany to

234
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,639
be able to uh get to a German audience

235
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:30,600
uh there's um supply chain uh

236
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:33,120
partnership like uh usually as extractor

237
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,680
manufacturer we have

238
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,399
um pretty sophisticated process for

239
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,638
Manufacturing Systems so we uh we're

240
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,639
looking at a lot of sourcing of

241
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,879
components uh just not purchasing like

242
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:49,440
Valves and pumps are not Partnerships

243
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:52,399
it's uh sourcing but uh when we do uh

244
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,839
part of the system or integration that's

245
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,200
another um partnership going to be

246
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,440
looking for companies to install in

247
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,639
Germany which is uh installation

248
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,680
partnership so we going to be

249
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,480
looking eventually also at Financial

250
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:10,919
partnership so to finance the system for

251
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,639
the local market so there are a lot of

252
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:16,599
things that can help setting up a

253
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,519
vertical integration which I see uh in

254
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,639
Europe is very typical to um to

255
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,000
Outsource your Niche uh that you're not

256
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,200
too competent to somebody else to do you

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,919

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,919
you gone about building some of your

263
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,719
more fruitful Partnerships over the

264
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,599
years when you think back on um ones

265
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
that have worked how did they come

266
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,560
together what is what's the learnings

267
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,440
there wow well uh if you are successful

268
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,638
with your first partnership that means

269
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,480
that you're either lucky or destined to

270
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,240
do

271
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,079
it it's 90% uh set to fell your first

272
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,799
partnership because 90% yeah if you God

273
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,479
damn okay good that's why that didn't

274
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,838
work out because the thing that doesn't

275
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,120
tell you is you have to figure out the

276
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,880
people you partner with and to figure

277
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,560
out the people you partner with like

278
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,879
usually the books say Okay first uh you

279
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,039
you need to feel your uh you see what

280
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,600
you need to Source second you need to

281
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,838
find a partner third you write a

282
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,920
contract and fourth follow the contract

283
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,680
yeah that doesn't work unless your

284
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:29,240
partner it's um it's a person that can

285
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:32,638
keep parts of it it's dedicated it's

286
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:37,278
passion then there's no contract that

287
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:40,680
can save you yeah it's like temperament

288
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:43,679
it's like ethics it doesn't show up in a

289
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,719
RFP you have to go and see how

290
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,239
they treat the waiter it's like a

291
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,160
marriage it's a it's a it's worse than a

292
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,919
marriage it's way you spend way more

293
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:57,879
time talking to this cont yeah right uh

294
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,360
you're chuckling over there Nathan have

295
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,120
you experienced this

296
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,759
well we um as I mentioned we're a

297
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,039
medical device manufacturer so we have

298
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,958
equipment all over the world I

299
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,159
personally have been to Mongolia China

300
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,198
and installing equipment and when you

301
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:13,198
have a good partner things go well and

302
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,719
when you don't you show up and they

303
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:16,439
don't have the equipment there or you

304
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
they want you to pay him under the table

305
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,760
to get you know get certain things done

306
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,639
and that makes life really miserable so

307
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,439
you know I like the idea that George

308
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,799
says about luck but you know just having

309
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
to get on the ground and go talk to

310
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,359
those some of those people is the only

311
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,519
way to get it done sometimes yeah if uh

312
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,759
you guys I've never done one yet just go

313
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,159
hang out with the person you're going to

314
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,399
do it with for a while and you're going

315
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,439
to know really fast whether it's going

316
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,879
to be like a fit or not I feel like

317
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
Desiree you're chuckling but I mean

318

psychology background can you um can you

320
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,800
drill down into this a little bit the

321
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,560
it's like there's this phrase that

322
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,399
Personnel is policy but the people are

323
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:59,599
the personnel and so the people end up

324
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:02,198
being the policy um yeah but can you

325
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,199
build on what they're

326
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:09,758
saying in what sense but um how do you

327
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,920

332
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,519
it's it's the same with being in a

333
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,720
relationship it's like because it's

334
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,120
really true that being in a business

335
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,440
it's like being in a marriage you know

336
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,639
and it's like the same as if you're the

337
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,639
president or anything you um you treat

338
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,039
the country as a business as well so in

339
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:52,278
a business sense

340
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:54,719
itself if two people let's say the

341
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:59,120
relationship and that is the most

342
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,639
important thing in any in any part

343
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,639
whether you're in business whether

344
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,039
you're in relationship if you know that

345
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,039
there are

346
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:12,319
two you don't really agree on some

347
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,519
things then and if the other one really

348
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,000
cannot accept it's more of the

349
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,959
acceptance of what each other's got okay

350
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,320
versus the like versus of going rock

351
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,559
unmovable I don't like what you're

352
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,879
saying and I'll fight this is what I

353
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,719
want it has to be you've got to have

354
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,519
more of an open mind and it depends on

355
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,040
what sort of course of business that

356
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,159
you've got and the person that you're

357
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:42,919
dealing with because most of the people

358
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:45,278
don't want to go and you know um get new

359
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:48,278
informations even though it's okay this

360
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:52,399
is my belief now there's new information

361
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:55,799
that I have you know received now people

362
00:15:52,399 --> 00:16:00,039
should be able to go and adjust that or

363
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:02,479
adopt it to whatever day or believe so

364
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:04,879
that at least it's a different way at

365
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,879
least you're opening your mind a little

366
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:12,480
bit to what the other person is saying H

367
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:16,000
instead of being really closed because

368
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,319
hey this is my belief I'm scking with it

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,399
yeah and I don't believe whatever you

370
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,000
say I think this is how we're going to

371
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,440
go do it this how we're going to put

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,440
where our money is and everything

373
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,759
so yes yeah do they have a goal

374
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,680
orientation are they about solving a

375
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,240
problem or do you have two members on

376
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,078
the team that are an Unstoppable Force

377
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,120
meaning an immovable object you ever

378
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,879
been on the teams with those two people

379
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,480
one guy's just bashing the other guy's

380
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,679
never L up and uh the phrase that came

381
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,600
to mind is like Styles make fights you

382
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,958
know um if two you could have two really

383
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,720
effective people but if they have

384
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,919
different styles of

385
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,759
operating then they're going to conflict

386
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:03,519
and the sorry someone's I was just to

387
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,279
add to that we um we had a group we were

388
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,240
working with in Brazil that I was

389
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,199
working with and we were getting along

390
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,439
fairly well and then we had a new person

391
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
came in and they had a very different

392
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,038
style so it wasn't very long after that

393
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,400
we had a different partnership with the

394
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:17,640
people in Brazil just because those were

395
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,160
the people that um got along with the

396
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,480
guy that we were working with that we

397
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,959
sent down there to to to set that up so

398
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,279
to your point I think a big part of it

399
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,679
isn't just similar goals but also has to

400
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,678
be similar personalities

401
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,120
um and one thing I would add is like and

402
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,360
maybe you guys can talk about this like

403
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,959
is there a way to go slow with

404
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,599
Partnerships can you break off a little

405
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,079
bit and do a little bit together and

406
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,839
then build so it's not like getting

407
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,319
married on the first date can anybody

408
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:44,839
talk about being more iterative with

409
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,399
forming strategic Partnerships have any

410
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,079
you guys ever gone slow or you guys just

411
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,519
paper it up it's all about financing if

412
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,159
you have 20 million you can do

413
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,679
everything vertical but if you have

414
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,320
200,000 you got to find somebody to fill

415
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,960
the

416
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,798
holes straight up

417
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,319
um how what are the main differences in

418
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:06,440
Partnerships structures in the US versus

419
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,439
the

420
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:16,320
EU okay so I started first in the EU we

421
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,880
started uh with cannabis in 2014 uh we

422
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:22,240
tried to do it ourself by doing the way

423
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,480
in us like we acquired a Farm Company

424
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,880
because we didn't work with this product

425
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,200
so we started to work with farming then

426
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,880
extraction you cannot design an

427
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,200
extraction system unless you work with

428
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,799
the plant so you have to figure it out

429
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,720
and we spent a lot in that

430
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:42,319
process well uh it was beneficial at GN

431
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,240
but what I saw uh as the differences

432
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,678
between the markets that in US everybody

433
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,720
wants to be vertical and usually

434
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,120
probably because it's much easier to get

435
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,120
to hard amount of money so they buy the

436
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:55,839
building they start to grow they then

437
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,158
they think about extraction then they

438
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,759
think how to make products then they

439
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,360
start marketing and this under roof

440
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,679
probably the best way to have most

441
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,279
margins but again what about if you

442
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,038
don't have the funding uh in Europe I

443
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,678
noticed that companies are specialized

444
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:13,558
in making products and they Source their

445
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,519
material so this is a partner that they

446
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,359
Source the materials from and there are

447
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:22,558
more than one like uh packaging uh

448
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:25,759
actives and base ingredients and stuff

449
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,319
like that so they sales partners that

450
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,119
they go to sales network that's a

451
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:32,678
partnership so in Europe is more open to

452
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,798
do uh their little niches and getting

453
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,759
Partnerships and that's kind of the

454
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,000
first way to look into a business is

455
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:42,798
like who do I work with to achieve that

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
structure uh Sunny you're nodding uh

457
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,839
have you seen this type of

458
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,240
heterogenity uh horizontal integration

459
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,439
less vertical in Europe like can you

460
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,679
build on what George is

461
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:59,880
saying with vertical integration you

462
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:02,080
mean um really going together um

463
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,080
working uh in Europe it sounds like

464
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,720
everyone's got a piece no one can do one

465
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,918
whole thing even at I think we are um in

466
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,279
Europe more used to really working

467
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,080
together with different uh companies um

468
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,480
than than in America it's like together

469
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,079
you know more than alone and that is

470
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,079
also why the Horticulture industry in

471
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,798
the Netherlands got so big because you

472
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,879
can also learn from your neighbor it's

473
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,240
your competitor but you together you

474
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,559
know more than alone and then that way

475
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,839
we yeah are still number one if you talk

476
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,678
about uh growing in green houses

477
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,240
Horticulture and that's also in the

478
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,519
Cannabis sometimes a bit frustrating

479
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,279
because everybody is so closed and don't

480
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,879
want to say anything how they are doing

481
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,678
what they are doing but I'm True

482
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,360
Believer that if you you talk with each

483
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,798
other you you get to know more details

484
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:54,678
and you can get a better product in the

485
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:57,038
end yeah how does the a partnership look

486
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,960
on paper uh what is a standard type of

487
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,400
agreement is there any standard type of

488
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,400
agreement

489
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,400
George I already mentioned that whatever

490
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,319
you put on paper may know have the power

491
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,840
to protect you at the end if your

492
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:15,000
partners are

493
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:18,480
not not honest and not right people but

494
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,720
usually you got to First Define like I

495
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
never do three-way agreements never

496
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,079
that's never I I would never do

497
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,080
three-way agreement it always needs to

498
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:32,399
be uh two um partner agreement then um

499
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,119
you have to clearly Define

500
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
responsibility of the first party

501
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,839
responsibility of the second party uh

502
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,200
confidentiality terms because if it's

503
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,199
not confidential it's not real

504
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,120
partnership your partner is to care

505
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,840
about your success your confidentiality

506
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:50,119
your passion needs to improve himself

507
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,678
continuously as you do improve yourself

508
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,959
so if you try to capture these things

509
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,278
into the agreement that's good at least

510
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,360
outline in the agreement as many

511
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:02,839
things as you can so both parties are at

512
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:06,158
least aware what page they are on yeah

513
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:09,158
and um you're going to see how it goes

514
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,679
through the signing process because the

515
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,760
you know when it goes through attorneys

516
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,480
is

517
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,960
the the point where then a lot of things

518
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,360
break because Partners you can see if a

519
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,798
partner is committed at that point yeah

520
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,759
I mean these all like sound like things

521
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,200
they tell you in relationship advice

522
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,599
like Define

523
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,159
responsibilities like have confidence

524
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:34,399
poity like commit to self-improvement

525
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,480
one member of the team can't be like

526
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,559
learning on du lingo and the other one

527

530
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,839
pickle together and you have to get out

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,679
strategies because you had mentioned

551
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,678
earlier that you were just published

552
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,200
some papers on screening there's three

553

types of screens now blocking solar

554
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,000
energy saving heat energy and then

555
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,759
blocking out light entirely for light

556
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,038
dep yep yeah those are uh certain

557
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,798
examples uh where you can look at how

558
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:53,640
can you in that way influence uh the

559
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,639
final ingredients in the the dry flour

560
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,159
in the end of course but yeah you can

561
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,520
also play with um irrigation fertilizers

562
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,880
um and seeing how you can affect plan

563
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,798
growth and development and the the

564
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,360
content of the final

565
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:10,278
flower can anyone talk about the law

566
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,918
side of it is there something you

567
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:13,319
shouldn't do if you're an American

568
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,640
coming over here and trying to do a

569
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:20,000
handshake deal to start a partnership

570
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,559
George uh have you ever run into like

571
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,159
what's the legal things to sort of think

572
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:24,798
about can you just do a contract like

573
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,000
you do in the United States and like

574
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,839
give someone percentage of the company

575
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,960
or those kind of Arrangements how are

576
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:35,918
the EU and the US different that

577
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,159
way well I've done anything between a

578
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,880
single page to 10 page agreements um

579
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,278
depends of the urgency depends of the

580
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,159
commitment usually this Agreements are

581
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,839
not to give percentages from the company

582
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:53,600
but to Define forms for JV that two

583
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,599
companies uh have equal responsibilities

584
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,599
in this

585
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,038
project

586
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,839
um I would say that that's uh even a

587
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,319
single page agreement can be powerful

588
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,558
enough to protect both sides yeah unless

589
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,480
everything is like everything needs to

590
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,960
be listed inside and everyone needs to

591
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,200
be on the same page what they have to do

592
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:18,200
in order to commit and full

593
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,440
fuel so um to add to that one of the

594
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,080
things I found is that people in general

595
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,440
are good people right everybody wants

596
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:27,480
best for their for their neighbor

597
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,679
relatively or in my experience um so

598
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,240
what what we found is that contracts

599
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,399
that are a little more in detail that

600
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,399
reduce potential amb ambiguity uh

601
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:38,239
increase the likelihood that you're

602
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,359
going to both be happy with the outcome

603
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,000
yeah that reminds me when the Catholic

604
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,519
priest pulls the young couple together

605
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,240
you really want to get married and they

606
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,879
like start ironing it out they make you

607
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,798
do a Consulting where you're like get

608
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,120
you guys get on the same page right

609
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,079
before you cuz like let's make sure

610
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,079
we're going to agree to split the money

611
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:58,398
right put go gos go in the same check-in

612
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,639
account like all the little the details

613
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:01,319
yeah if you don't have the details and

614
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,200
you go into it you both might be going

615
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,918
into a a relationship a partnership with

616
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,880
different expectations and when those

617
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,759
don't happen or when something

618
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,919
unexpected happens if you don't have a

619
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,278
way to handle it both parties could be

620
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,720
very unhappy and you could find yourself

621
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,398
you know in a legal Court trying to

622
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,319
figure figure things out which is not

623
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:20,359
good yeah I mean I'm we're going to

625
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,199
to take some questions um I wanted you

626
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,480
guys to go down the line and tell me

627
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,120
what Partners you're looking for next

628
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,120
you're looking for financing Partners

629
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,558
correct yeah so the biggest um um

630
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,439
prohibitor for us to expand into Europe

631
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:36,398
um technology Works Industry is

632
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,159
acceptance of it but it's financed our

633
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:41,239
equipment is not inexpensive um and so

634
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,360
if we're looking for people who are

635
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,000
willing to take on the Cannabis industry

636
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,038
uh to finance it we it took us a while

637
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,079
to find Partners in the United States

638
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,278
and they helped us grow significantly so

639
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,278
that's what we're looking for in Europe

here hello thank you for your time thank

694
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:24,479
you um uh sorry

695
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,439
the the um you guys touched on a lot of

696
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
hot to Forum Partners um within the

697
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,600
Cannabis sector were there different

698
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,720
or in your experience has there been

699
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,119
different partners say with ancillary

700
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,319
businesses or certain say ctiv our

701
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,479
processors or even dispensaries that you

702
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:43,158
would recommend or recommend shying away

703
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,480
from um I guess uh I'll give everybody

704
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,519
like 30 seconds answer because we're

705
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,519
going to wrap it up I would say look for

706
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,640
who's got co-signs like is someone

707
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,278
reputable have they been around to other

708
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,399
people coign them um they have a track

709
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,000
record of experience versus like an

710
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,398
unproven partner where they're saying

711
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,240
they're promising the world but they

712
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,439
don't have much to show for it yet

713
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,159
there's a reason why people with large

714
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,200
reputations might be more pricey to work

715
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,039
with than someone new for example in the

716
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,038
cultivation space on the breeder side um

717
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,919
it's Wild and Woolly right now and seeds

718
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,398
and so when I'm writing about seeds and

719
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:19,440
who's got good ones I look for who's

720
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:22,798
winning Awards who other Growers want to

721
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,840
work with um and that is like a proxy

722
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:30,200
for their quality like the

723
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:33,119
cosiness do anybody else got build on

724
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,960
that just gossip among your friends

725
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,239
that's my advice yeah right we have

726
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,200
another question over here I'm in the

727
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,880
back go for it I'll Stand okay hi

728
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,080
everyone I'm Stephanie pow I'm the

729
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,240
founder of emerald L recruitment we're

730
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,319
revolutionizing how Recruitment and HR

731
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,359
services are delivered to the Cannabis

732
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:52,720
space uh yes across the globe so here we

733
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,719
are my question is you know these days

734
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,960
there's a lot of people who are

735
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,079
consultants and fractional it's you know

736
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,720
the buzzword is fractional everything

737
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,879
these days it is a good solution but

738
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,919
what I see from my side is the

739
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,120
difference between a partner a true

740
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,759
partner and a consultant and so as

741
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:11,678
people are and there's so many

742
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,839
consultants wanting to actually be a

743
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,798
true partner to our clients and to

744
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,519
customers were serving you know what do

745
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:19,079
you see the big difference between

746
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,880
actually being a partner versus a

747
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,798
consultant and how has that been

748
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,440
successful with the companies you've

749
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:29,918
actually truly partnered

750
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,919
with I can answer that question

751
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:39,079
when you are partner into um let's say

752
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,759
manufacturing company uh you need to be

753
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,319
vested into the products that is

754
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,839
developed as example we work with number

755
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:48,000
of universities and we had uh

756
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,879
consultants in the beginning but they're

757
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,839
professors in University that help us to

758
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,519
develop our systems so they've been

759
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:58,879
awarded even after we start selling the

760
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,519
systems uh because they're Direct work

761
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,519
was uh appreciated and was uh in a

762
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,599
foundation uh with what we do so we

763
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:11,440
treated them as partners and as soon as

764
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,599
you're invested into this uh business

765
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,360
with your customer then you can become

766
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:19,000
partner but they also have to recognize

767
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,479
you for that and give you the credit and

768
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,240
and this is a long-term relationship

769
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,360
it's not like a year or two it's can be

770
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,278
20 years so as soon as this value is

771
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,599
built and created and improved every

772
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,880
year

773
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:34,839
this is a great way to create a

774
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,519
partnership fantastic uh we have one

807
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,759
emotions are two different things

808
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:02,479
passion helps you emotion harms you

809
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,359
everything is numbers in business

810
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,759
everything is numbers you have to be

811
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:10,799
sure you have the value that value has a

812
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:13,679
number and you has the return that you

813
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,440
expect to and do it with

814
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,358
passion yeah are we at

815
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,639
time yeah great well um this is such an

816
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,639
important topic I got eight and 11y old

817
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,639
boys they're forming strategic partners

818
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,960
for life right now making friends on the

819
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,240
yard it doesn't get any more basic than

820
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,800
this I mean these people will be with

821
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,878
them their lives and in the business

822
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,519
sense maybe it's not like that kind of

823
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,159
friendship but it's that kind of

824
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:41,199
long-term strategic relationship and so

825
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,280
it doesn't get any more foundational the

826
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,398
why is so important if you don't know a

827
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,040
a person's why their reasons for being

828
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:48,078
what what's motivating and what's

829
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,960
operating in them you don't know the

830
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,399
first thing about them and um so I hope

831
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,679
you take some of these lessons out in

832
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,000
there dig deep into the people you want

833
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,280
to work with make sure you're aligned

834
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,960
and then start small and build outward

835
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,040
from there uh make sure it's the right

836
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,280
fit don't don't get into something you

837
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,440
need to get out of later right everybody

838
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,839
exactly yeah I'm glad to hear it was 90%

839
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,119
fail rate for the first one though

840
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,119

841
