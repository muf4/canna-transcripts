1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,599
good morning

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,960
welcome to the first icbc

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,559
global investment forum i think not only

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,800
in berlin but also in germany

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,000
alex um you invited me to this

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,039
conference

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,879
we had some good discussions in advance

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,279
you asked me for some materials i sent

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,079
you the cv some photos

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,719
and you continually continue continue to

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,960
ask me more photos so i was

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,200
as i was thinking

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,239
why do you ask me for these photos

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,879
but i was too shy to ask so i made my

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,959
idea my own ideas i think it was because

16
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,359
i looked too much like a traditional

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
banker

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,119
and

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,038
therefore i was thinking what can i do

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,959
against that

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
the only thing which came into my mind

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,799
was i

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,079
let my hair grow which i did and alex i

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,078
hope you appreciate it

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,719
but i have to admit this is only facade

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,359
um

27
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,000
professionally i was grown up in banks

28
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,959
i'm doing m a business since almost 30

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,959
years

30
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,679
i started with arthur anderson in

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,839
cologne and milan then built up the mla

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,080
department at nottwe one of landers

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,520
banks in germany then i was heading

34
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,319
the

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,158
m a department of the zed bank second

36
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,000
largest german bank

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
worked for a family office

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,359
and

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,079
opened up my own m a boutique with

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,280
partners a couple of years ago

41
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,839
and

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,519
i think alex it was exactly what you

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
wanted you wanted the view of an mna guy

44
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,599
on the on the

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,000
cannabis industry in germany

46
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,640
and we noticed one thing when we talked

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,640
to investors regarding cannabis

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,640
companies

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,399
they always smile at the beginning i

50
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,798
don't know why but it's a very positive

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,359
introduction to talks

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,799
and we don't see this smile when we talk

53
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,439
about

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
a machine component manufacturer

55
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,520
and there are always some engineers who

56
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,598
are you used to smile also when they see

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,159
these machines but usually they only

58
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,519
smile when they see machines

59
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,520
and

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
but apart from that the cannabis

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
industry

62
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,839
makes people smile at the beginning but

63
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,919
at the end

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,159
it's still a business and the economic

65
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,238
rationale behind it is the same as we

66
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,959
have it in other markets

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,840
so in my keynote i would like to

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,560
elaborate how an m a guy sees the state

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,159
of the cannabis industry in germany

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,560
we will also have a close look on the

71
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,799
funding landscape and the expectations

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,479
of different investors

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
and i will also try to highlight some

74
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,878
specialties and obstacles

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,200
for the cannabis industry in germany

76
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,439
always from the point of view of an m a

77
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,439
guy

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,920
what we're doing m and a

79
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,639
most of the time we organize sales

80
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,719
processes sales does not always mean

81
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,079
that we sell the whole company

82
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,239
but we

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
find new partners to enter the companies

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,920
partners who bring in growth capital

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,480
experience on new market opportunities

86
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,719
we also find adequate target companies

87
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,719
adequate buyers we organize the whole

88
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,560
transaction process

89
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,639
from the preparation of the information

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,560
memorandum the market approach

91
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,598
organization of the due diligence

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
process

93
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,679
and the negotiations until signing of

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,158
the sales and purchase agreement and

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,159
finally closing that's in a nutshell

96
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,798
what we are doing

97
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:42,798
we do that

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,519
in a

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,040
cooperation

100
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,280
so we are focusing on germany if we need

101
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,840
advice from other countries we are bound

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,039
into an international network gcg geneva

103
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,680
capital group

104
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,719
and most of these of our partner

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,560
companies

106
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:07,519
are like us um owner

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920
driven and owner managed mna boutiques

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,480
in most of the

109
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:16,159
economic centers in the world

110
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,039
apart from canada i have to admit um

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,759
and

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,319
i suppose if we talk to our colleagues

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,840
in the us or the states they will have a

114
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,478
completely different view on the

115
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:29,599
cannabis markets market than we will uh

116
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:32,560
we have it here in germany and i think

117
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,400
for our canadian and u.s colleagues

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
the cannabis market would be very

119
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,918
similar to the aforementioned

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,680
machine component producer

121
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,918
so it might be even more interesting for

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,680
us to focus on the german market

123
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,918
there's i think much more fantasy

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,918
and

125
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,240
last slide on what we are doing

126
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
our cooperation um is active in 27

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,319
countries

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,280
27 sorry industry segments in 24

129
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,038
countries and 30 of our transactions are

130
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,719
cross-border

131
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,959
and when we are talking about the

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,080
cannabis segment

133
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,758
we're talking about the medical segment

134
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,879
the wellness segment

135
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,400
the pharmaceutical industrial hemp adult

136
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,079
use and whatsoever so different markets

137
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,719
and we might also

138
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,639
look alongside the value chain genetics

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,360
cultivation processing extraction

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,720
purification formulation manufacture

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,439
distribution retail brand and so on

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,080
and what traditional investors do

143
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,240
they try to find a box which they

144
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,639
already knew know

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,800
and to compare this box to the cannabis

146
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,720
market so

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
when we start discussions with new

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,039
investors it is very important to find

149
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
the right box are we talking about

150
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,560
agriculture are we talking about

151
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,839
healthcare or is it narcotics

152
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,519
and

153
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,839
alongside with that we also have

154
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,918
different valuations wherever we tick

155
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,918
the box

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
when we from germany or europe

157
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,759
look

158
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,399
into established markets

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,400
it's clear that we have to consider the

160
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,799
us and canada

161
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,959
and think if this could be a blueprint

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,199
for the german industry or the european

163
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,038
cannabis market as well

164
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,280
and especially in canada with its

165
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,959
relatively easy access to capital by

166
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,679
public markets

167
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,758
cse and tsx in toronto

168
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,879
opened the door to retail investors and

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,879
growth growth

170
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,199
but now we see and we come to that a

171
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,359
little bit later that with this

172
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,280
equity stories of the stock quoted

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,759
companies we don't

174
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,079
have only positive effects but we i

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,960
think we can also learn something from

176
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,680
the experiences um the canadian and u.s

177
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,439
stock quarter companies made met

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,680
during their expansion

179
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,639
and especially the conservative attitude

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,800
of germans towards stock markets might

181
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
lead probably to other

182
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
and different forms of financing in

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
germany

184
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,279
and i think i haven't been there at that

185
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,400
time but i think europe must feel now a

186
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,399
bit a little bit like the us in 2013

187
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,239
when colorado and washington were the

188
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,279
first to open the

189
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
the

190
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,799
were the first rec states

191
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,520
and the fundraising in the u.s was

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,639
always driven by new opportunities new

193
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,879
states

194
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,879
and

195
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,919
and a continuous growth since many years

196
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,120
and canadian and us investors have a

197
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:52,399
close look on the developments

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,959
and in europe and in germany and try to

199
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,399
continue their growth stories

200
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,318
also in europe

201
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,318
if they are still in the position to do

202
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
that i mentioned late i mentioned before

203
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,720
that we come to that

204
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
later

205
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,759
because they have to underline their

206
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
equity story

207
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,639
and they want to replicate

208
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,639
their success in europe as well

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,038
i doubt if that would be possible as

210
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,120
they think but i think that is what we

211
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,598
can expect from the u.s and canadian

212
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,598
companies

213
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,478
in europe

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,680
um

215
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,758
started 2001 to enter the medical

216
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,319
cannabis market and we only talk about

217
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,399
medical cannabis here

218
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,360
the netherlands paved the way for

219
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,759
medical cannabis in 2003

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,479
other countries followed with a very

221
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,479
strong delay

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,000
but production capacities are expected

223
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,639
to build up very significant

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,200
in the years to come

225
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,439
12 european countries legalized out of

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,839
21 legalized medical cannabis in the

227
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,240
last five years so it's still a very

228
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
recent development

229
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,159
and many countries enter the medical

230
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
cannabis market via projects pilot

231
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,919
projects

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,040
and plan to establish medical cannabis

233
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,039
in their healthcare systems

234
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,240
to date no european country has

235
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,639
legalized cannabis for adult use purpose

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,959
luxembourg switzerland are thinking

237
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,159
about to fully legalize cannabis and

238
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,919
also

239
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,639
netherlands are rethinking the actual

240
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:29,039
concept but today we're still talking

241
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,039
only about medical cannabis in europe

242
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,480
in recent times

243
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,838
some of the european stock exchanges

244
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,039
woke up

245
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,399
especially

246
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:43,120
um in in the united kingdom um and in

247
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,120
the in copenhagen and and stockholm

248
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,720
um in united kingdom end of 2020 we saw

249
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,679
um

250
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,399
allowance that both uk and overseas

251
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,719
cannabis companies can be listed at the

252
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,958
lse the london stock exchange

253
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,079
provided that the pro that their

254
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:05,518
activities can either either be licensed

255
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,120
um or would be legal um in the uk

256
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
and that the proceeds of the crimeac do

257
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,039
not apply

258
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,799
um the lse had a number of

259
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,559
um

260
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,958
oversubscribed ipos

261
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,199
and therefore the uk until now is the

262
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,000
most active

263
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,519
cannabis country in europe

264
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,320
a rough estimate would be that about 50

265
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,639
percent of the european funding volume

266
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,920
comes from the state comes from sorry

267
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:36,639
comes from the united kingdom

268
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,439
and the second largest country

269
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,559
with

270
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,200
approximately 10 of the funding volume

271
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,199
is germany

272
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,319
but germany is by far that can come with

273
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,120
what we can see here by far the biggest

274
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,200
medical market in in

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,919
europe with about 73 percent of the

276
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,959
whole market volume but if we compare

277
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,879
the the share of the market size which

278
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,159
is estimated to be about

279
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,399
300

280
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,600
million i'm not talking about billion

281
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,480
300 million in europe right now

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,480
and compared to the size of

283
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,600
about 25 billion the market size of u.s

284
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,278
and canada

285
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
we see the big difference and where the

286
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,480
market stands

287
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,278
in 2017 a german pilot program for

288
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,000
medical cannabis allowed the production

289
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,000
of 2.6 tons

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
for the selected companies they are

291
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
mentioned here aurora afria

292
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,560
and dimikan

293
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
and

294
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,399
these

295
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
three german operators gained

296
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
substantial interest

297
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
as many companies wanted to get a

298
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
footprint into the german market

299
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,359
um

300
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,440
but i think now we made the experience

301
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,839
that economic wise

302
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,560
the terms of the deal were not as that

303
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,399
positive as they expected to be at the

304
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,439
beginning

305
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,480
so germany cannot meet the total demand

306
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,120
of about 5.5 tons per annum

307
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,519
and and imports the rest

308
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,519
from usually canada and netherlands in

309
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,000
the history but

310
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,240
now nowadays also from spain denmark

311
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,958
portugal and some other countries which

312
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,959
cover the difference

313
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
when we look at the big three or four

314
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,838
countries

315
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,839
companies which are used to be said that

316
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,959
they dominate the market they all come

317
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,000
from the states in north america

318
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:43,359
um they did a lot of value chains

319
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,759
enhancement in the past

320
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,839
their acquisition strategy follows a

321
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,519
horizontal integration alongside the

322
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,480
value chain

323
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,320
we saw a lot of transactions in the past

324
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,039
we came to the german come to the german

325
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,360
transaction in a while and we will see

326
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,278
that they are not that active anymore at

327
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,278
least in germany

328
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,039
but we have a very no notable

329
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,240
transaction um

330
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,799
that in the in the states um that the

331
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,759
tilray acquired a significant

332
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,838
stake

333
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,720
in the multi-state operator madman

334
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,639
with 26 suspensory dispensaries

335
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,120
and also a private equity company from

336
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,759
toronto entered in and put in another

337
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,278
hundred million dollars and proceeds to

338
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,240
open new markets

339
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:33,759
and another 15 dispensaries are secured

340
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,440
by this dry powder so there's a movement

341
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,240
in the between the states and canada

342
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,639
and

343
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,440
when we look at some

344
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,480
uh if there's anything we can learn

345
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,600
from the development of these big

346
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,680
cannabis companies

347
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,440
i always used to look at the figures and

348
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,039
when we look at the figures of for

349
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
example aurora

350
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,799
and also canopy growth

351
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:04,559
the revenue and i'm talking about 2020

352
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,000
the revenue of aurora was roughly 300

353
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,359
million

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,320
and the net loss was was

355
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,600
3.3 billion and this is not an error

356
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,160
this is

357
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,480
the balance sheet of aurora of last year

358
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,879
so they made a lot of

359
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,000
they made a lot of

360
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,360
impairments there was roughly 2.5

361
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,360
billion of negative impairments

362
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,159
and even if we take out the negative

363
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,480
impairments of 2.5 million there's still

364
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,439
a significant net loss in comparison to

365
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,039
the

366
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
revenue made and

367
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,159
if

368
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
we also look at canopy growth which is

369
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,559
similar

370
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,519
it's

371
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,399
a revenue of roughly 400 million they

372
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,000
have

373
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
um

374
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,958
impairments of about 600 millions and

375
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
the net loss of 1.3 billion so if a

376
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,399
traditional investor looks at these

377
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,679
figures must say something went wrong in

378
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,000
the history

379
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,958
they are not profitable on an operative

380
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,839
basis they had they made much too

381
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,719
expensive acquisitions in the past

382
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,600
and i leave it to your judgment if the

383
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,320
way canadian and u.s cannabis company

384
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,519
grew in the past is that what we should

385
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,519
adopt in europe

386
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,600
when we look at the european landscape

387
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,319
and

388
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,079
when we remember the market size then we

389
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
can also think that

390
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,638
the investor landscape is very different

391
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:43,278
from the states

392
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:46,240
and the investor types which drive the

393
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:49,600
development in europe right now are

394
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,680
almost for about 80 percent early stage

395
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,959
investors

396
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,838
that means accelerators incubators

397
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,479
high network individuals which stand for

398
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,240
about roughly 45 percent of the funding

399
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,639
volume in europe

400
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,120
and venture capital in its different

401
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,879
stages stands for another roughly 40

402
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,159
percent

403
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,320
and only

404
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,879
more or less 10 percent of the

405
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
transaction of the funding volume

406
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,360
um

407
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,919
came from

408
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,039
let's say traditional investors private

409
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,919
equity and family offices

410
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,838
and that gives in my opinion a clear

411
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,078
difference between where the american

412
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,000
the u.s and american and the canadian

413
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,519
market and the european market stands

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,679
nevertheless

415
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,000
talking about germany

416
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,479
there are a lot of

417
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
transactions especially which took place

418
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,079
especially in

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,679
this year

420
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,559
and we saw an increasing m a activity

421
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,319
and we saw a bunch of very different

422
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,399
transactions

423
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,360
the recent transaction

424
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,240
from all this year is australian health

425
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,838
house board can farmer

426
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,160
a privately held german medical cannabis

427
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,119
sales and distribution company

428
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,720
which also owns own also a clinic

429
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,558
medical cannabis consultancy in

430
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,600
barcelona

431
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,279
and

432
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,240
in germany can farmer imports and

433
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,078
distributes third-party medical cannabis

434
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,078
products

435
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,078
and holds also a pharmaceutical

436
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,879
manufacturing license

437
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,279
and

438
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,480
now health house could

439
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:36,480
leverage the um german contacts of ken

440
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
pharma

441
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,360
the second transaction which took place

442
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,519
in june this year and from my opinion is

443
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,599
the most interesting transaction is

444
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:49,119
sanity group a startup from berlin

445
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:52,000
berlin founded in 2018

446
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:55,119
was able to close the biggest funding of

447
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,279
roughly 36 million

448
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,678
from new and existing investors it was a

449
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,558
second financing round

450
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,919
and investors from europe but also from

451
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,160
the us

452
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,320
and i think and i'm very curious if we

453
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
can hear more about this

454
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,000
from my point of view very exciting

455
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:16,079
transaction in a while

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,079

narcotics industry

503
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,440
and kind of medical prior to the merger

504
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,759

505
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,960
medical cannabis of medical cannabis in

germany

507
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,759
and here we also saw a private equity

508
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,080
company aquila capital

509
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,440

of new capital

512
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,558
so this is the transaction landscape we

513
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,599
saw

514
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,000
um

515
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,558

00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:48,399
from prior years 2019 which i don't want

518
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,119
to elaborate on that now

519
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,679
but

520
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:55,599
that means we see much more m a

521
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,840
activities in the past in germany

522
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,918
and what gives me even more confidence

523
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,759
for the german company in this market

524
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,240
these are the transactions these are the

525
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,200
companies who got funding in germany but

526
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,038
there's a whole bunch of companies

527
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,159
which is active in the german cannabis

528
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,000
market

529
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,360
some of them are also present in this

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,440
conference

531
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,759
and therefore for example i'm very

532
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,798
curious to hear the experience of tim

533
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,359
feiker the cf ceo of wiko he will talk

534
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,839
to us later the day very interesting

535
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,839
company

536
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,720
when we're talking about early stage

537
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,240
investors and i mentioned this is

538
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,919
more or less the investor type we're

539
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,038
talking about in the german cannabis

540
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,038
markets

541
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,240
early stage investors are strong

542
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,480
believers

543
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,558
and traditional investors ask for

544
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
evidence i think that's the difference

545
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,319
between these investor types and usually

546
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,399
evidence

547
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,639
should be demonstrated in financial

548
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,679
statements statements

549
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,759
traditional traditional investors love

550
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,720
long

551
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,119
established strong growing markets and

552
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
profitably profitable and cash flow

553
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,439
positive companies

554
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,640
so none of the canadian stock listed

555
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,480
companies would match the expectations

556
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
of german traditional investors

557
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
but the canadian companies and the

558
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,199
market they are active in

559
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,960
serve as a blueprint for the german

560
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
cannabis market

561
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,079
they give clear evidence to the fact

562
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,840
that the cannabis market is existing and

563
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,798
is strong growing

564
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,720
the initial product the cannabis flower

565
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,079
already exists and we don't have to

566
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,159
invent it

567
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,119
and we do have the proof that it can be

568
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,039
sold

569
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,839
therefore the proof of concept is

570
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,839
already there even in germany

571
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,079
and this

572
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,879
is the difference from a market in which

573
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,558
the starter wants to sell a new and

574
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,600
revolutionary machine which nobody knows

575
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,519
already

576
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,839
the founder believes that his machine

577
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,319
will be disruptive and he needs other

578
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,000
believers default vc investors to give

579
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,119
him money

580
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,599
cannabis is an already existing product

581
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,399
and is already sold internationally

582
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,558
and once national legislations change

583
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,600
the cannabis market from our point of

584
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:20,079
view will develop very fast

585
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,639
and that's why we believe that this step

586
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:26,000
from an early stage in worcester which

587
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,640
we saw before to traditional investors

588
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,359
will be a very short one and will be

589
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,360
very fast

590
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,879
it is my assumption that traditional

591
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,679
investors

592
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,720
will look at opportunities which offer

593
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,360
at least one profitable year

594
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,440
most of the funds usually require

595
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,119
at least three profitable years but i

596
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,798
think in this

597
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,599
industry

598
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,839
for

599
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,000
not all funds but some funds might also

600
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,558
accept one positive fear

601
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,038
and companies should have a

602
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,038
turnover of around 10 million or

603
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,440
slightly with all that

604
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,679
then they will gain the attention of

605
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,840
traditional investors

606
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,240
and we believe that this sales

607
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,480
level should be achievable especially

608
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,599
for distribution sales company in a

609
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,120
relatively short time frame

610
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,079
there's still a lot of money in the

611
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,839
market

612
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,839
and not enough attractive target

613
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:33,399
companies to satisfy satisfy the

614
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,399
appetite of the institutional investors

615
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,839
german

616
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,839
traditional investors

617
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,840
usually are interest in cannabis models

618
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,278
business models once we talk to them

619
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,439
but there's still

620
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,119
very little know-how and understanding

621
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
of the market

622
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:03,359
and that's why i'm also very grateful

623
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,840
for alex work alex's work here

624
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,399
we need more know-how and understanding

625
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,278
of the cannabis market in germany

626
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,559
especially the traditional investors

627
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,240
and this applies for different kind of

628
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,200
investors

629
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,200
for almost every established markets

630
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,840
market we have investors who have a

631
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,480
specialized sector expertise

632
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:29,678
or they have experience from recent or

633
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,440
formal participations

634
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,679
in the cannabis market apart from

635
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,038
general curiousness and a positive

636
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,600
attitude we still notice a lack of a

637
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,759
solid gut feeling which makes

638
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,240
traditional investors jump into

639
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,359
participation

640
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,919
there are still

641
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,798
ongoing discussions

642
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,880
if we are talking about narcotics or an

643
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,038
agricultural product

644
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,720
some investors still have compliance

645
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,240
problems

646
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,519
german banks are still very restrictive

647
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,000
as far as

648
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,480
real estate financing is concerned

649
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,720
most of the cannabis production sites

650
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,400
are built outside germany and german

651
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,159
banks usually do not want to finance

652
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
cross-border

653
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,440
lots of them still have compliance

654
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,159
problems

655
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,159
and still exclude cannabis production

656
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,000
sites

657
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,159
real estate investors

658
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,240
um

659
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,559
or for real estate investors

660
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,880
cannabis farms are niche market with

661
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:34,240
high capital requirements

662
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,640
for relatively small companies

663
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,079
and cannabis production sites are also

664
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,919
seen as special purpose properties

665
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,439
which unclear with an unclear second use

666
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,720
and

667
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,720
third most of

668
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:55,839
the real estate investors are too small

669
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,798
in order to get to have a positive

670
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,678
impact often cannabis production site on

671
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,558
their risk position and the overall real

672
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,880
estate portfolio there are only

673
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,359
two handful of potential investors in

674
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,080
germany right now

675
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,079
political risk and dependency mainly on

676
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,158
particular political decision

677
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,639
is also something which traditional

678
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,360
investors do not like

679
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,759
so these are some obstacles

680
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,839
um i think we work today on the first

681
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,919
one on the understanding and now how of

682
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,639
the german cannabis market

683
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,640
and i stick to my belief which i

684
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,559
mentioned before

685
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,399
this step from an early stage market to

686
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,359
traditional investors

687
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:43,439
in the cannabis industry will be a very

688
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,719
fast one

689
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,440
i wish you

690
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,000
