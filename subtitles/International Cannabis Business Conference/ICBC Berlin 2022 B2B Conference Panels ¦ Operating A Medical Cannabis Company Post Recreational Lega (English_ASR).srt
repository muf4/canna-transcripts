00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,839
hello everybody and welcome to our panel

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,039
on operating a medical cannabis company

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,039
post-recreational legalization um i

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,480
think personally this is actually a very

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,118
very important

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,519
topic because we have to make sure that

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,920
patients can keep access

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:27,039
and that the dispensary is not the

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,199
alternative option for patient access

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,760
and i'm very very happy to have four

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,600
very experienced entrepreneurs on my

12

and we have stephen farbek president and

28

ceo of taylor cannabis but hello

29
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,760
cannabis has two branches they handle

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,599
cannabis clinics and to have kind of

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,759
this retail concept

32
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,919
so i'm super excited to have these

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,519
experienced panelists here

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,359
and i'd say we just

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,319
jump straight in and start with you

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,719
diane

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,879
i am i understand most of the gmt

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,438
group's operations are based in jamaica

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,118
but you're a canadian company so how did

40
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,039
energy use legalization and cannabis

41
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:37,040
affect your business

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,360
not very much actually lisa because um

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,280
two things to start with can't the

44
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,319
health canada has

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,478
banned imports in canada so despite the

46
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:51,039
fact that we have exported

47
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:53,920
between 2018 and 2020 about 30 000 kilos

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,118
of dried flour today you cannot import

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,200
into canada the other thing is we at the

50
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,478
time started to see the writing on the

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,960
wall we have an excessive amount of

52
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,319
cannabis available in canada today and

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,599
so it was very clear we were going to

54
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,038
see some downward pressure on the

55
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,038
pricing

56
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,238
so in canada what we do is we support

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,919
research we are in a pediatric and out

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,920
of epilepsy trial

59
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,079
with the university of saskatchewan but

60
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,799
that's all of our activity

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
at this time so for us it had very

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
little impact on our business model

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,599
yeah that's very interesting to see um

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
dave

65
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,238
um what do you think as your europe

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,840
looks ahead to legalize uh recreational

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
cannabis what are three or four most

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,439
important things that we can learn from

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,920
you from the u.s particularly in

70
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,639
california all right thanks thanks very

71
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,878
much thanks to icbc for inviting us here

72
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,279
today and to all of you and to my good

73
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,239
friend over here matt cumin who's my

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,479
guru and mentor who brought me into this

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,319
12 years ago

76
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,079
i've been in san diego by way of new

77
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,518
york

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,800
since

79
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,959
2010 we've been watching

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
california in particular transitioning

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,800
from

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,080
medical to adult use

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,319
we tend to

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,920
try to refer to

85
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,759
recreational adult use on purpose

86
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,199
because we think that

87
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,878
this is one of the things i think we've

88
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,079
learned is that

89
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,719
calling it

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,120
recreational plays into the hands of the

91
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,799
haters who think that we're trying to

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,878
pervert their children

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
so this is something that we've been

94
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,598
trying very hard to change the messaging

95
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,158
on

96
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,439
these last few years it's been quite a

97
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,318
transition

98
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,340
uh 2018 was the first year that we've

99
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,598
had adult use in california

100
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,200
[Music]

101
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,719
and it's been

102
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,798
challenging

103
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,598
so one of the things i think

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,360
uh i can say uh it's there's an old

105
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,318
saying uh

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
when i was growing up

107
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,560
those who don't know history

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,120
are content condemned to repeat it so i

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
encourage you all in europe to watch

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
study

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920
what we've done in the united states

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,480
states like california colorado

113
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,199
washington oregon more recently states

114
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,719
like new york new jersey canada

115
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,918
and

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,880
almost scientifically study what we've

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,198
done right and what we've done wrong

118
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,478
and try to avoid the mistakes

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,639
that have been made

120
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,918
and try to emphasize the things that

121
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
we've done right

122
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,299
so for example

123
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,918
um

124
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,520
[Music]

125
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,560
in the united states

126
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,719
particularly in california

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
we have not really streamlined use

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
technology as much as i think we could

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,439
have

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
to streamline the licensing and

131
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,639
permitting process to make it more

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,439
efficient and economical to get people

133
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,199
into the business and to get them

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,199
to do what they want to do

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,879
and

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,080
it's the licensing and permitting

137
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,000
process has become very cost prohibitive

138
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,038
and i recommend that you try to find

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,199
ways to use technology to keep keep

140
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,399
streamline the process and keep costs

141
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,400
down one more thing

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,360
don't look at excise taxes or vat

143
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,919
as the way to make money for the

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,720
government solve all the problems

145
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:28,079
pacify the people who are against this

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,080
because the the more the product ends up

147
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,680
costing the patient or the consumer

148
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,319
the higher the likelihood is that the

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,918
illicit market is going to thrive

150
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,240
and that's going to make it harder for

151
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,079
those of you who want to operate legally

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,918
and then i guess the last thing i'd say

153
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,758
in my little three or four points what

154
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,959
we can learn

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,160
innovate

156
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,079
innovate

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,199
interview

158
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,038
never stop innovating

159
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
yeah super important point thank you for

160
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,079
saying that

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
um alex how did the legislation of

162
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,560
cannabis affect medical patients in

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,840
canada and what lessons were learnt to

164
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
prevent

165
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,758
or can we learn to prevent the same

166
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,519
issues here yeah i really want to bring

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,919
this over again thanks for having me

168
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,639
again it's great to be back in berlin so

169
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,240

170
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
i really

171

173
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,000
excited about having cannabis everywhere

174
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
we believe that cannabis should not have

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,918
been prohibited to begin with that you

176
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
know the listed market has a lot of the

177
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,839
challenges that we want to do better in

178
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,520
the legal market but we cannot forget

179
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,839
about the medical patients i think this

180
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,240
is something that has to be stressed

181
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,679
because what happened in canada and uh

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,720
i'm almost still steve stuck here

183
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
because this is something that he's

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,800
lived through is once that once

185
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,119
recreational happens a lot of the

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,960
companies who are fake medical start to

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,519
come out you start to realize who really

188
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,359
cared about medical who didn't and then

189
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,439
you start to realize a lot of these

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,759
companies that were talking medical the

191
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,360
second the wreck happened they

192
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
threw everything on the ground and ran

193
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,919
as fast as they can to go public and

194
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,680
open up retail stores

195
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,359
which is not as wonderful as people

196
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
think it is but that's another topic for

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,560
another day

198
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,120
the thing is that i think germany can

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,959
really learn from our mistakes is around

200
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,360
like we have a maximum on the amount of

201
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,359
thc for edibles as an example

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,360
but why not for medical purposes why

203
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,960
should there be a maximum like there's

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
no maximum on the amount of other

205
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,399
medications and you have to trust

206
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,198
patients to be able to take the right

207
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:30,000
amount so that's one example also taxes

208
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,759
on medicine is ridiculous we canada

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,800
don't tax any medicine

210
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,680
except we have taxes on medical cannabis

211
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,478
um

212
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,240
so that always made no sense uh

213
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,478
but so so there's a few things that we

214
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
did wrong uh but one thing that we're

215
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,240
starting to do right but i think germany

216
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
has an advantage of is on the pharmacy

217
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
side

218
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,680
very proud to see that germany is going

219
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,519
full speed ahead with going medical

220
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
cannabis to pharmacy that would have

221
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,598
helped canada a lot because to have

222
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,799
pharmacy led cannabis

223
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,639
is really the way it should have been

224
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,400
done and i think that's going to be a

225
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
big advantage for you here

226
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,038
uh but and the last point i'll say then

227
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,280
we'll let steve uh kind of talk to this

228
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,199
point is around uh insurance that's

229
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,799
another thing in germany because you

230
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,720
have some insurance covered i know i

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
hear a lot of people complaining about

232
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,800
uh it's not covered enough and you know

233
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
not enough approvals i can tell you with

234
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
canada we only have one group and there

235
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
are the military veterans who have

236
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
coverage

237
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,759
and that's considered a very lucrative

238
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,839
kind of offering for licensed producers

239
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
but here in germany you have way more

240
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,879
coverage already so

241
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,879
and this is something very typical in

242
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,240
canada too like in canada we sometimes

243
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,158
complain about our industry and then we

244
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
go elsewhere and we realize how good we

245
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,799
have it and i would also just last point

246
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,680
to express that to the german people is

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,278
that as tough as it is you're still so

248
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,439
much further ahead than you used to be

249
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,519
and there's a lot to be proud of so uh

250
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
you should definitely be proud of the

251
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,278
fact that you even have pharmacare that

252
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
you do have coverage for anybody even

253
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,879
though there's a lot to be desired and

254
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,480
there's more coverage to be had

255
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,679
there are some things to be proud of so

256
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
those are just some quick thoughts and

257
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,879
i'm sure i'll share some thoughts

258
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,958
yeah thank you um stephen

259
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,958
can you tell us a little bit how do you

260
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,879
differentiate between patient access and

261
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,799
to recreational side of your business

262
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,879
what are the main differences between

263
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,199
those like if you look at it yeah this

264
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,200
is um one of the largest challenges that

265
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,560
we faced and one of the key things that

266
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
we wanted to

267
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,518
want to actually be able to do at hello

268
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,640
cannabis

269
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
um

270
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,319
what we found is this big blend blurry

271
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,200
area between medical patients that use

272
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
cannabis and recreational users that use

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,759
canvas

274
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
and

275
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,120
one of the key goals that we started

276
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,600
trying to do and uh when i moved from

277
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,519
the legacy market over into the legal

278
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
medical clinic market

279
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,879
is to be able to try differentiating

280
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,839
between

281
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,159
medical patients and recreational users

282
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,240
and there is a distinct difference

283
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,600
hello cannabis started as one of the

284
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,159
first independent legal medical clinics

285
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,320
we're now operating with over over 6 000

286
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,000
patients and we've gathered enough data

287
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,120
to see distinct differences between

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,320
medical patients and recreational users

289
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,759
some of that is derived because of

290
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,760
essentially how access is given so we're

291
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,078
seeing some very similar

292
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,919
similar

293
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,559
trends basically with

294
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:27,199
how they have access right now it's very

295
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,039
easy to walk to a brick and mortar store

296
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
and typically you're starting you see a

297
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,719
different demographic when you look at

298
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,719
medical patients you're seeing a

299
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
different demographic

300
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
when you were trying to differentiate

301
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,360
between medical and recreational

302
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,039
um i found that a very very very

303
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,919
difficult challenge

304
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,838
because i i will candidly admit i i'm a

305
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,719
patient first i've always been a patient

306
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
first

307
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,680
and i was blessed to be able to share my

308
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,518
origin story here some six years ago and

309
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,838
it's very nice to be back alex thank you

310
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
again on cdc for having us

311
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,839
um

312
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,519
i do use cannabis recreationally as well

313
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,800
and i think there's a very distinct

314
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,919
difference between when i'm using it

315
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,078
medically when i'm using it

316
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,879
recreationally um

317
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,078
what

318
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,759
we did differently is we opened up the

319
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,078
one of the first legal recreational

320
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,000
stores in the country and we actually

321
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,239
intentionally put it right beside where

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,078
our brick-and-mortar medical clinic was

323
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,799
we're unfortunately hindered to be able

324
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,439
to give any medical advice with respect

325
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,479
to cannabis in a recreational store

326
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,959
yet one in three people would walk in

327
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,200
and ask a question about the medical

328
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,119
properties of cannabis and legally we're

329
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,959
not able to do that so of course

330
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
everybody finds a loophole on how they

331
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,599
can talk about a medical

332
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,600
aspect of it but not

333
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
talking about a medical aspect of it

334
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,879
just like wow

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,240
you really want to feel

336
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,399
relaxed

337
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
you know you do this and and you have 25

338
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,600
year old kids that are coming in

339
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,440
asking medical questions or pseudo fake

340
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,519
medical questions to be able to find

341
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
something for their grandmother who's a

342
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,078
75 year old lady who probably has a

343
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,920
whole host of other medical conditions

344
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,679
and medications that would definitely be

345
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,639
interacting with cannabis in a different

346
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,638
way

347
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
they need to speak to especially

348
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,320
they need to speak to somebody that

349
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,559
understands titration that understands

350
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
their personal needs and how to be able

351
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,359
to use it properly and unfortunately

352
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,439
that's completely lacking the

353
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,959
recreational world and we were the first

354
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,639
in the world to do this and it's a model

355
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,039
that actually worked far better than i

356
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
expected and i really encourage people

357
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,120
to look at this we have the model for

358
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,919
this this truly is not meant to be

359
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,600
a self-promotion here but it worked and

360
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,159
having a medical clinic beside that

361
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
recreational store and being able to

362
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,240
track these trends and offer

363
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,399
the services for every single different

364
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,919
consumer of cannabis was an absolute

365
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,078
game changer for us and i think an

366
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,399
absolute game changer for the area in

367
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:55,278
southern ontario for us to be able to

368
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,759
have a 25 year old kid come in

369
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,679
and ask questions for his grandmother

370
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,958
but then be able to immediately give

371
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,759
them access

372
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,919
and

373
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,679
most importantly his grandmother's

374
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,599
access to a doctor to be able to speak

375
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,359
about what specifically

376
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,959
they need

377
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,039
really changes the game and there is a

378
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,599
distinct difference between canvas when

379
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,078
it's used medically and recreationally

380
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,240
and unfortunately you do need a doctor

381
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,638
to be able to differentiate that or at

382
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,919
least a formal educator

383
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,200
and that's where the pharmacists i think

384
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,719
come in also

385
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
uh because with their formal training

386
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,959
and that's where germany is really going

387
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,799
right

388
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,039
yeah but you have to understand that in

389
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,199
germany we are at a very critical point

390
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,958
at the moment our observational survey

391
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,079
that was running stopped they published

392
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,879
the results

393
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,879
it goes a lot against flower and

394
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,639
like a lot of patients are scared that

395
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,639
they will lose access now once

396
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
recreational reform counts that they

397
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,480
have insurance say we won't pay for your

398
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,879
solid products anymore it found might

399
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,120
have just like 10 seconds there what

400
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,120
what we noticed as soon as recreational

401
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
opened up not only did the licensed

402
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,440
producers

403
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,120
that had this fake medical it was the

404
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
only we were their only source of

405
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,600
revenue if you were a medical clinic you

406
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,399
were the only source of revenue for lp

407
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,040
and when rep came out they all ran and

408
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,440
unfortunately we saw that access to

409
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,958
medicine became extremely limited the

410
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,600
resources we had to be able to help

411
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,359
patients became extremely limited and

412
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,680
everybody went straight right and

413
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,720
unfortunately a lot of those lp's that

414
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,198
went recreational stop even paying us

415
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,519
i have absurd amounts of

416
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,439
accounts receivables from lps that just

417
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,399
said we're not supporting medical

418
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,760
anymore

419
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,639
and these are very very

420
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,720
critical elements that have crushed very

421
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,919
good companies with very good people

422
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
that were driving them and their

423
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,719
elements

424
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,078
that will come out of germany does not

425
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,120
do this right

426
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,439
it can actually destroy an industry's

427
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,679
morale it can actually destroy

428
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,680
the real core purpose and economics of

429
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,159
this industry as well and i've seen it

430
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,958
destroy a lot of people in the country

431
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,120
uh in canada we survived this some way

432
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,679
somehow i had a full head of hair at one

433
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,600
point it wasn't that long ago

434
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,000
sorry lisa can i just ask that the other

435
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,800
thing that happens

436
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,639
when you see these players go rush into

437
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,599
the rack and pull out a medical

438
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,879
is your research funding dress up

439
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
so

440
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,240
i can't tell you how many

441
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,078
requests we get for supporting research

442
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
in canada right now because our friendly

443
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,359
competitors

444
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
have all pulled out because they're so

445
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
much focused on the recreational market

446
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,838
so we've got patients who have

447
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,359
challenges with access we have patients

448
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,240
who can't afford their medicine because

449
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,720
we have excise tests and that we have

450
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,879
research that is not getting kind of

451
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
funding that we should we should have

452
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,919
and we had at the beginning of this

453
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
so i think it's not just yes we need to

454
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,278
make sure the patients have what they

455
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,720
need but if we talk about this industry

456
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,120
around the world the regulators are

457
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,120
asking for real world data you cannot

458
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,799
get real world data if people are not

459
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,720
investing in the science

460
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,198
and so again that's part of protecting

461
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,120
your medical cannabis industry while you

462
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,039
bring up a wreck industry again i'm

463
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
biased i don't do rack

464
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,799
power to you i think you know it has a

465
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,078
place but shouldn't that be true also

466
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,000
for example for if you say cannabis has

467
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,758
certain effects shouldn't you also be

468
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
able to provide some data that really

469
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,800
absolutely and that can happen if you

470
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,799
don't do the research

471
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,320
all right

472
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,559
dave i wanted to ask you a question

473
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,079
about compassionate use and patient

474
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,278
collaborators and those kind of things

475
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,879
do you have those kind of things in

476
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,439
california can we talk a little bit well

477
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:43,360
california has for the most part since

478
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
2018 really the

479
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,759
adult use market aka recreational has

480
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,679
really taken off

481
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,879
and

482
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,679
in the eyes of most of the public has

483
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,360
more or less replaced

484
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,078
medical

485
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
we don't have separate

486
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,918
medical

487
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,119
dispensaries or separate medical

488
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,319
pharmacies

489
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,678
um a medical patient with a medical

490
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,438
recommendation

491
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,160
because in california

492
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,720
a doctor can give a recommendation it's

493
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,679
not a full it's not a formal

494
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,558
prescription fulfilled at a pharmacy

495
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,120
it's a recommendation that

496
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,000
law enforcement recognizes

497
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,159
um

498
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,720
so if you have a recommendation you can

499
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,759
go into a adult use recreational store

500
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
buy

501
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,960
a wide variety of products deliverable

502
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,599
in many different formats from

503
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
flour and pre-rolls to gummies beverages

504
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,038
to chocolate

505
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,880
and many other things in between

506
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,359
and

507
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,520
the main

508
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,439
difference for the medical patient with

509
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,200
the recommendation is

510
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,400
while they're gonna pay they will pay

511
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,440
the same state sales tax that any

512
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,840
californian for example will pay on any

513
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
product

514
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,399
food

515
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,159
electronics they're going to pay the

516
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,959
same state sales tax they won't pay the

517
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,600
excise tax the extra special excise tax

518
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,200
so the medical patient gets that

519
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,038
break if you want to call it that and

520
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
then the medical patient can also still

521
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,119
grow

522
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,519
at home

523
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,479
there are you know you can grow

524
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,960
six eight ten plants uh

525
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,120
and even get together with a few friends

526
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,240
uh who are also medical patients

527
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,959
there's an opportunity there that um

528
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,599
has not been

529
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,400
i don't think it's been

530
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,359
mentioned or utilized as much as it

531
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,160
will be

532
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,479
in the years to come as the adult use

533
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,880
market continues to struggle with the

534
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,558
illicit market over taxation and over

535
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
regulation

536
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,960
well like this part is particularly

537
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,798
interesting because we have of course

538
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,640
patients who do not have access yet who

539
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,160
are still illegally growing and who get

540
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,720
ready by the police and these things are

541
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,720
happening in reality

542
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,038
like it's crazy but in the end it's also

543
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,799
about access and here's this discussion

544
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,720
going on the patients are not able to

545
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,679
cultivate the cannabis so it can be a

546
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,038
medicine what's your stance on it

547
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,038
that's going to change

548
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,720
i mean that's fine and simple

549
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,240
that that's going to change

550
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,319
yeah and you know on that note it's

551
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,359
funny uh i gotta say there's just it's

552
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:40,480
so repetitive and deja vu like it feels

553
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,319
like such a flashback of 2013 and canada

554
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,400
all the same things that i hear complain

555
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,399
about here is the same thing we complain

556
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,519
about oh we can't let people grow we let

557
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,880
them grow

558
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,798
we're not going to have an industry it's

559
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,559
like what the hell are you talking about

560
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,440
we've been we've had people growing look

561
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,359
i grow in my house i still buy plenty

562
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,960
don't worry uh you know

563
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,959
your industry is safe from people

564
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
growing their own do not worry about

565
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,720
that

566
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,319
perfect example is how many people have

567
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,558
a vegetable garden in their backyard and

568
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,158
still buy fresh fruit and vegetables

569
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,119
everybody has a great point like every

570
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,480
point

571
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,798
i've been in mmar since 2010

572
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,798
i first started with a 50 plant limit

573
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,000
like that's that's even far more than

574
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,440
enough medicine that i could maybe

575
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,599
and it's just for playing names how do

576
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,640
you grow still still purchasing from

577
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,519
stores

578
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,440
of course like everybody it's

579
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,519
there's so many

580
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,600
exact carbon copies that are happening

581
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,440
right here and we're hearing the same

582
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,519
fear stories

583
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,600
that led canada down a very

584
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,158
very odd path

585
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,319
and we're seeing it all being planted

586
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,400
here right now and that's really

587
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,918
important that alex said people think if

588
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
you're going to grow your own cannabis

589
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,759
it's like well if they can grow tomatoes

590
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,959
like like all these greenhouses are

591
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,640
going to be toast nobody's going to buy

592
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
any tomatoes the tomato industry's going

593
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,840
to be dead like i grow tomatoes in my

594
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,798
backyard every year i buy a shitload of

595
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,119
tomatoes

596
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,119
and just quickly sorry before we go on

597
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,199
the key thing also i want to express is

598
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,879
from processing it's about finished

599
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,400
goods the actual growing the actual bud

600
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,679
is not where it's at and i know

601
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,360
everyone's setting up and raising

602
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,559
millions and we did that in canada too

603
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:23,359
we had words like uh funded capacity and

604
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,440
uh cut canopy size and just silly stuff

605
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,038
like that don't get fooled by that it

606
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,279
doesn't matter how much cannabis you can

607
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,960
grow it's what you can do with it so i

608
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,960
can grow my own cannabis but can i

609
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,798
extract my own oil no i don't think i

610
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,038
have a million dollar extractor that can

611
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,798
do the oil extraction or can i make my

612
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,200
own edibles oh yeah sure i could make a

613
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,279
chocolate but can i make ten thousand

614
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,120
and a million chocolates like these this

615
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,599
is where the money is in this industry

616
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,239
not on the growing so anyways uh just

617
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,918
quick little rant on that apologies

618
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,798
no it's good i hope you all carefully

619
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,080
listen

620
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,000
um

621
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,079
so uh diane you mentioned before that

622
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,480
patient act about negative negatively

623
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,279
impacted by the introduction of

624
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,759
canada's recreational market um

625
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:09,038
what uh what happened there and how long

626
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:12,679
did it take to work itself back out

627
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,679
it hasn't worked out

628
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,678
if germany doesn't look real hard at

629
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,759
what happened in canada and california

630
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,559
but you know i think at the end of the

631
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,480
day

632
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,399
this is something i said last month

633
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,240
sorry boys you're hearing me again but i

634
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,960
said last month in canada is that we

635
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,599
need to ensure we have almost two

636
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,480
divergent industries here i'm not saying

637
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,079
there's some degree of

638
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,599
similarity particularly when you're

639
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,199
looking at quality i don't care if your

640
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,879
consumer ingesting this or your patient

641
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,880
you still have to have a significantly

642
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,640
high bar when it comes to to quality um

643
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,799
you know again i have extreme medical

644
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,280
bias so you know we don't believe that

645
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,319
smoking is the best way to take one's

646
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,119
medicine

647
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,240
so

648
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,158
you know we

649
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,319
look at best-in-class technology like

650
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,720
nano-emulsification i think when you're

651
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,079
truly putting your patient first

652
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
that

653
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,720
is a different discussion than when

654
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,960
you're creating

655
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,759
a consumer product for consumer

656
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,400
enjoyment right when you have people

657
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,079
like we do who are compromising

658
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,759
compromised immune systems they could be

659
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,558
out there with their life that's what's

660
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,839
at the heart of our products so the

661
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,720
things that the panel before we're

662
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:36,639
talking about eugmp quality standards

663
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,279
gacp these are all extremely expensive

664
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,080
um endeavors to to get to and one of the

665
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,240
things to get back to canada we also saw

666
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,119
i think that um that guys would agree

667
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
with me

668
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:51,278
is when we had the rush for wreck we

669
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,000
also had significant downward pressure

670
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,079
on the economics because we had so much

671
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,798
product in the

672
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,158
in the industry that was shifting into

673
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,319
the wreck industries do not have

674
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,799
patients who can't access medicine but

675
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,359
we have a massive black product which is

676
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,158
pushing pressure on the economics and

677
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,479
what suffered was quality

678
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,080
right and so now you've got consumers

679
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,038
and patients who are suffering from

680
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,359
quality and so again it's it's just

681
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,079
another flag that we would send to

682
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,278
germany and for me personally why i say

683
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,678
you need to

684
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:28,480
look at these industries in relation to

685
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,759
who the end user is and a patient is a

686
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,159
different end user to steve's point

687
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,879
than somebody who wants to

688
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,320
you know have a joint on their death on

689
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
a saturday night with a nice glass of

690
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,599
wine right it's a completely different

691
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,319
situation just one thing to add to that

692
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,319
you know

693
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,240
why does equality suffer it's around

694
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,119
economics this is another lesson to be

695
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,038
learned

696
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,158
once you let no offense to any business

697
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:53,278
people i mean we're at a business

698
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
conference so

699
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,319
can't be saying anything negative of

700
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,158
business people of course but

701
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,079
when it becomes about the dollars and

702
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,240
cents much more than the patients and

703
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,918
money is raised you start to figure on

704
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,839
wait a minute how do we save money how

705
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,679
do we cut corners and that's when

706
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,519
quality really starts to suffer

707
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,360
there's very few high quality growers

708
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,440
it's very expensive to grow at high

709
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,439
quality but there's a sure a lot of low

710
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,278
and medium quality growers trying to

711
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,080
bring their costs down and i think

712
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,919
that's a lesson to be learned also is

713
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,519
you know cannabis is not very expensive

714
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,960
to grow

715
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,038
you know we talk about it being very

716
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,720
expensive but the actual cost of growing

717
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,200
cannabis it can even be done really high

718
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,880
quality for not that expensive but then

719
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,440
you know when you talk about taxes it

720
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,278
was funny earlier this uh talk here with

721
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,880
all the government officials uh they're

722
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,880
all taxes are all just waiting like

723
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
salivating waiting on the tax dollars

724
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,880
same thing happened in canada you know

725
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,640
right now every dollar that's sold 50

726
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,200
cents of it is going into taxes in

727
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,240
canada like that's disgusting

728
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,720
if i i can add 71 cents and this is an

729
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,120
actual real data 71 cents out of every

730
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,440
single dollar um for the retail brick

731
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,759
and mortar is to the government we're

732
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,000
scrambling over 29 cents

733
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,919
right absolutely and so

734
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,599
you talk about low quality so you know

735
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,799
the economics it could be really well

736
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,639
that once too many people get their

737
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,158
hands in and you know greedy people want

738
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,919
to make a lot of money on it with low

739
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,760
expenses and the government sees how

740
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,880
much money is being made and before you

741
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,839
know it

742
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,440
that's why we get into this problem

743
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,158
you wanted to add something no i could

744
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,278
just say the other thing um again

745
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,278
bringing my

746
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,880
my focus is

747
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,839
you know when we're looking at what's

748
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,559
coming in addition to the growth

749
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:38,399
standards the other thing to look at is

750
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:41,519
you know what is going on your plants

751
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,080
and what if you're growing in ground

752
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,000
what can leach into your plants

753
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,960
not that that is an important consumer

754
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,839
it is but as a medical patient

755
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,278
you know if you're going through

756
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,119
chemotherapy

757
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,798
and you're

758
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,119
taking something that also has heavy

759
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,599
metals in it never mind people have

760
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,519
blown any pesticides on it but the heavy

761
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,759
metals from something down a road has

762
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:07,038
leached into you that that is a very

763
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,038
dangerous situation for a

764
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,679
we've been talking a lot about

765
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,919
differences between the industry maybe

766
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,919
we can talk a little bit what is similar

767
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,559
between the two parts and what can we

768
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,600
learn from the existing medical part for

769
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,839
the recreational market

770
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,439
i'm gonna go first therefore alex or

771
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,829
nation

772
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,640
well let's see um

773
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:32,079
[Music]

774
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,480
i i think you know the the uh

775
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:37,119
one of the things that we observed as i

776
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,278
mentioned earlier in

777
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,158
in the california experience is that

778
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:43,278
the

779
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,240
delivery

780
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,640
system

781
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,120
if you will pretty much

782
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,440
got emerged uh

783
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,439
so that as far as

784
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,080
where to go to buy

785
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,399
your medicine or buy your

786
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,199
used product there's one place instead

787
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:04,319
of a pharmacy for

788
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,440
uh your medicine and the the the

789
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,480
canvas store for your adult use product

790
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,720
it's pretty much one retail store so you

791
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,679
you're going to want to decide here

792
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,558
in germany and in europe is that a model

793
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,120
you want to follow or do you want to try

794
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,558
to divide it up because as we talked

795
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,639
about there's really

796
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:25,519
two different two different products

797
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,159
here

798
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,398
uh and there's a very very important

799
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,360
decision to be made

800
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:35,599
sooner rather than later

801
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,599
and

802
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,000
i'm not saying

803
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,000
that the

804
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,919
the california or the u.s model for that

805
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,519
matter which is pretty similar in most

806
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,520
of the states

807
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,798
is the best model

808
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,480
um

809
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,240
but

810
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,679
it

811
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,240
it has

812
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,840
been working to the extent that for the

813
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,558
consumer

814
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,319
patient or adult use

815
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,079
consumer

816
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,678
[Music]

817
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,000
there are if you haven't been to

818

california please come to california for

819
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,519
many reasons but if for nothing else to

you might want to come visit one of our

823
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,720
canvas stores

824
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,038
some of them you feel like you're

825
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,278
walking into an apple store

826
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:27,038
you know with all the sales people the

827
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,038
bud tenders all wearing the same

828
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,880

products now

833
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,000
as we talked about there's some care

834
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,359
that needs to be taken about where

835
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,038
you're getting your advice if you're

836
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,158
there for a medical product do you want

837
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:49,440
to have

838
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,039
um

839
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,679
you know some uh

840
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,558
some person maybe who has

841
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,000
been

842
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,759

six months or two years giving you your

844
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,960
advice on what you should be taking for

845
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,799
your

846
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,278
neuralgia your

847
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,519
your aches your pains

848
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:11,038
your stomach problems probably not

849
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,480
but it's an interesting model

850
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,440
and

851
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,798
as a consumer it's

852
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,759
fascinating

853
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,639
so

854
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,079
um

855
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,399
i recommend

856
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,158
and for any journalists in the audience

857
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,359
if you haven't written an article yet

858
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,679
about the 50 things that the

859
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,759
50 states or the 47 states in the united

860
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,000
states and canada have done right and

861
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,359
done wrong i i encourage you to write

862
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,919
that article

863
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,599
um because there's a lot of data to

864
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
learn from yeah

865
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,398
on that it looks like one mistake that i

866
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,158
hope uh germany does not make so you go

867
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,000
to vegas and you go to like this one

868
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,919
place planet 13 which is

869
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,679
just it's so ridiculous and maybe that

870
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,038
works in vegas but you know if anyone

871
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,000
out there is looking to buy a retail

872
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,398
store

873
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,839
most people want to buy their cannabis

874
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,839
and get that effect

875
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,759
so before you start spending all this

876
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,158
money on all these fancy stores and all

877
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,440
this experience inside your store most

878
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,799
people are not going to care and you're

879
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,558
not going to realize that until your

880
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,480
store is open and you're just watching

881
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,240
people not even look at your fancy walls

882
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,240
you spend thousands of dollars on and

883
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,000
they're just being like looking at you

884
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,839
and they're leaving yeah see who knows

885
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,599
about that

886
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,839
but just to talk about some of the

887
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,480
positive things i know we've maybe been

888
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,519
a little negative up here uh but

889
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
somebody wanted to say something

890
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,119
no no but we want to be positive like

891
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,360
one thing that is very very important is

892
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,959
around education we came here to icbc

893
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,719
six years ago talking about the

894
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,480
importance of education here we are six

895
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,919
years later still talking about the

896
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,240
importance of education so i hope

897
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,159
germany really gets that right is around

898
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,319
the education side of it and something

899
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,240
that me and were talking about backstage

900
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,720
is around the importance of research

901
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,399
you want medical to really be separated

902
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,919
you really need to focus on the research

903
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,398
there's a lot of different modes of use

904
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,159
now uh you know in canada's defense we

905
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,839
started this with only bud everything

906
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,080
else was illegal you could have gone to

907
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,398
jail for making oil that's how we

908
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,839
started 2013. it's observed

909
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,359
germany has a chance to be so much

910
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,119
better because we know so much better

911
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,359
there's a bit more research done more

912
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,119
needs to do invest in the research don't

913
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,278
just put those money in the pockets of

914
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,599
your shareholders put it back into

915
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,880
cannabis research so that's it

916
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,918
if i may i'll keep this short and sweet

917
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,519
please

918
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,278
see the value in people that are

919
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,640
actually operating

920
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,359
entities now

921
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,278
we have been doing this everybody that i

922
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,439
have seen that was in 16 countries a

923
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,798
year before coveted speaking at many

924
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,960
different places working with many

925
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,079
different governments around the world

926
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,519
and

927
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,119
some countries are actually paying

928
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,440
attention to people that are actually

929
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,599
doing it saying you can do it having a

930
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,000
vision having a sales that having the

931
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,759
best team in the world all that's great

932
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,359
it's super great talk to people that are

933
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,038
actually doing it it's a lot different

934
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,519
when you actually do it

935
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,558
and the value and the little tips and

936
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,240
tricks

937
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,759
that you can get from people that are

938
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,278
actually doing it please do not

939
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,679
underestimate it

940
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,440
five minutes with somebody like alex

941
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,080
somebody like myself when you're talking

942
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,679
about each different specific thing when

943
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,000
you're talking about

944
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,159
all of these different specialties that

945
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,079
we all have i'm telling you five minutes

946
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,679
of time with us can literally say that

947
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,519
be the difference between

948
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,320
a profitable

949
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,399
long-term business and completely

950
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,319
getting crushed we have watched some of

951
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,359
the best teams that raised the most

952
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:32,079
money get absolutely slaughtered we

953
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,079
bootstrapped this ourselves and started

954
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,759
taking actual seed funding after we were

955
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,879
generating remedy

956
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,359
we

957
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,120
really eat what we cook and we learned

958
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,158
the hard way and we learned the right

959
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,918
way in my opinion and i beg for germany

960
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,640
to do that too

961
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,480
i've

962
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,720
seen the exact same things happening

963
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,798
here and the exact same

964
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,519
overconfidence thinking we know exactly

965
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,918
what we want if i walk into a store i

966
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,159
know what i want if i'm going to grow

967
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,640
cannabis and own a production site i

968
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,919
know exactly how to do it i'm telling

969
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,519

970
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,720

996
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,409

997
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,409
[Music]

998
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,640
in a second but and they give you the

999
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,960
possibility to pose questions i just

1000
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,960
wanted to ask the penalties for one last

1001
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,199
piece of advice for the german

1002
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,240
colleagues if you could each maybe like

1003
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,838
this was pretty good to advise already

1004
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,519
but maybe if the other three of you

1005
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,679
could also add a little bit to that and

1006
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,800
just give one piece of advice and then

1007
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:31,118
we can open the floor to questions

1008
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,839
mine would be uh from a medical

1009
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,519
standpoint as product innovation

1010
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,759
it has to be continuous you have to

1011
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,159
continually be looking at

1012
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,640
um how do you make sure your product

1013
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,960
looks like medicine it looks like

1014
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,879
something your child with epilepsy would

1015
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,159
be comfortable to use or your

1016
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,920
grandmother or grandfather would be

1017
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,319
comfortable to use

1018
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,559
and it just takes constant innovation

1019
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,079
constant investment and if i could just

1020
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,719
add one other thing

1021
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,720
just something steve said do not rush to

1022
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,639
the almighty public money

1023
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,559
right we stay private

1024
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,159
um for seven years at this it was

1025
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,519
supposed to take four

1026
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,399
uh so

1027
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,639
you know

1028
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,559
don't rush full of money because it gets

1029
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,519
much much harder once you've taken that

1030
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,358
money

1031
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,559
it keeps you prudent if you're private

1032
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,639
it really keeps you prudent with your

1033
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,639
operations and your spending if you're a

1034
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,799
profit profitable private company it

1035
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,719
speaks absolute volumes look at what the

1036
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,400
public companies have done

1037
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,159
99 dropped in the last like three years

1038
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,599
i'm looking at when we took our final

1039
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,358
like our seat round like 3.5 million

1040
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,240
um we were the number one peer-reviewed

1041
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:41,279
store in ontario we did 14.7 million in

1042
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,879
sales our first year and we stayed

1043
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,280
private and i was looking at what

1044
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,039
happened with he went public and what

1045
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,960
people were doing these companies have

1046
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,838
dropped

1047
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,280
91

1048
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:53,119
in three years

1049
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,760
and then they just used their stock as

1050
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,838
currency and drag everybody down with

1051
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,400
them the amount of deals that i've been

1052
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,960
offered that i wanted to take with paper

1053
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,039
money and a few of them that i did take

1054
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,639
i would i would have been holding eight

1055
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,719
cents on the dollar

1056
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,559
and i got strung out and nearly nearly

1057
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,000
ridden into bankruptcy more than once

1058
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,119
because of chasing

1059
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,358
a big exit and don't make that mistake i

1060
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,960
had a little bit of greed in my eyes and

1061
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:23,000
i would never do that again i want to

1062
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,000
see anybody else do it

1063
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,800
well i um i'll try to make this quick i

1064
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,279
i started out uh

1065
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,359
working with canada's clients and in the

1066
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,760
cannabis field as i mentioned earlier 12

1067
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,719
years ago i've been a copyrighted

1068
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,359
trademark intellectual property and

1069
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,358
innovation lawyer for 40 years but i

1070
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,920
started taking those skills into the

1071
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,838
cannabis space about 12 years ago

1072
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,440
because as we were starting to see

1073
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,559
california move from

1074
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,559
recreation

1075
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:56,000
from uh

1076
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:59,039
medicine medical to

1077
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,519
adult use i started seeing that it was

1078
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,960
inevitable that the investors and the

1079
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,079
partners and the

1080
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,440
wall street

1081
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,359
finance companies were going to start

1082
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,039
coming in to try to get into the

1083
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,078
industry and

1084
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,199
innovate

1085
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,800
but they were going to want to know how

1086
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,879
to collateralize

1087
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,280
their investments and so

1088
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,200
it was only a matter of time before

1089
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,800
the companies that were moving from

1090
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,319
medical to adult use we're going to

1091
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,000
start asking

1092
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,559
where are my copyrights where are my

1093
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,838
trademarks where are my patents where

1094
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:34,480
are my trade secrets so i encourage you

1095
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,639
as you're making this transition if this

1096
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,000
transition is inevitable which it looks

1097
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,719
like it may be

1098
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,920
to start thinking now learn everything

1099
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,679
you can

1100
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,960
about copyrights patents trademark

1101
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,399
straight secrets because they're going

1102
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,760
to help your industry stay ahead of your

1103
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,519
competitors

1104
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,640
um and it's

1105
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,039
it also

1106
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,838
encourages you to stay innovative

1107
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,599
and

1108
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,279
there's the four basic tools copyrights

1109
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,760
patents trademarks trade secrets learn

1110
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,160
learn learn figure out what's most going

1111
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,640
to be most important to you and then how

1112
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,598
to roll them out how to implement

1113
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,159
those

1114
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,240
those processes in your business in what

1115
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,199
sequence that makes the most sense for

1116
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,279
you for your budget and uh i'll close it

1117
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,719
off i will open up the questions uh

1118
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,079
further following on what steve was

1119
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,159
saying is that

1120
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,680
talk to people with experience

1121
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,039
we didn't have that luxury we were

1122
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,039
starting something that no one else has

1123
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,039
done so it was very difficult walked

1124
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,279
into a lot of brick walls in the dark

1125
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,559
not realizing it but now you have people

1126
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,240
who have done it

1127
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,599
and not only who have done it make sure

1128
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,078
when people tell you about what they've

1129
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,920
done make sure they've actually done it

1130
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,320
make sure they've actually executed on

1131
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,920
what they said not just in theory uh you

1132
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,599
know i'm here with my company luch

1133
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,559
brands we've done things on a large

1134
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,559
scale and don't get fooled by people who

1135
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,320
say they can do something that haven't

1136
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,519
done it when you're giving advice make

1137
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,960
sure it's from people who have done it

1138
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,639
and if they have done it then they can

1139
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,880
help you and they can save you tons of

1140
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,639
money and tons of headache and time so

1141
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,960
that's my last advice and a lot of

1142
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,799
stories not a lot of action all right

1143
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,240
thank you everybody and we'll open the

1144
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,240
floor okay it's all round of applause

1145
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,720
give him a microphone

1146
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,920
hello

1147
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:46,000
nice to meet you my name is steve alex i

1148
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,400
love you guys um i used to run the

1149
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,559
biggest medical cannabis illegal

1150
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,039
dispensary in canada before legalization

1151
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,719
mmj canada

1152
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,400
these problems that you guys are

1153
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,838
speaking about now even after

1154
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,519
legalization

1155
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,039
are the problems that i was screaming

1156
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,599
about at the top of my lungs about

1157
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,599
research and development lack of support

1158
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,200
from the government

1159
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,200
we're all going through the same thing

1160
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,000
now that we're legalizing i'm going to

1161
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,838
be opening uh another multiple

1162
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,400
medical cannabis chains in the next few

1163
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,159
months licensed

1164
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,838
we all know that the government's

1165
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,920
corrupt they're not going to take care

1166
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:24,559
of patients the way they should be

1167
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,519
we know that there is no support for the

1168
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,440
patient

1169
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,800
so instead of being upset about it

1170
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,440
constantly

1171
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,599
what are we going to do as a group diane

1172
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,679
steve alex myself what are we to do

1173
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,440
differently to protect the patients

1174
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,719
because we have to be a lot more

1175
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,039
creative

1176
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,118
than any other person in the industry

1177
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:46,800
because of the lack of resources that we

1178
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,838
have even with

1179
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,760
proven research which is being denied by

1180
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,759
the recreational market

1181
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,920
for financials

1182
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,920
because they want to keep the profits

1183
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,480
going instead of taking care of the

1184
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,318
patients so my question truly is

1185
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
how do we work together and how do we

1186
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,460
fix this moving forward i love it i can

1187
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,079
answer that very shortly

1188
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,559
[Music]

1189
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,920
um hats off to you as well uh no matter

1190
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,159
what i've always took my hat to this

1191
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,400
gentleman that we're from the same area

1192
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,279
and he was kind of like the the king of

1193
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,119
the uh illegal cannabis and i was the

1194
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,079
i i can't even teach that word for

1195
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,640
myself

1196
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,720
but i i was the guy for the the legal

1197
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,838
medical side and people thought it was

1198
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,199
like

1199
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,358
we were

1200
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,000
arch nemesis but it was very much very

1201
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,679
very very different than that um so what

1202
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,480
what can we do differently

1203
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,879
um i candidly i'm not going to publicly

1204
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,119
disclose what we're doing to be able to

1205
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,599
bypass what the government is taking out

1206
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,200
of our pockets that literally makes it

1207
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,359
financially impossible for us to have

1208
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,199
longevity i'd be happy to talk to people

1209
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,279
individually about that i'm dead serious

1210
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,679
it works and it's a plan we're doing it

1211
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,519
clint's on the same page as well

1212
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,960
but the second part is helping other

1213
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:00,318
countries to not make the same damn

1214
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,159
mistakes man

1215
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,239
because we're passing point and overturn

1216
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,000
in many areas in canada

1217
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,838
and i'm a chartered investment manager

1218
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
i've worked on bay street for 14 years i

1219
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,920
own my own investment firm as well

1220
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,760
i know i know finance and i know

1221
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,760
cannabis and i know business i know

1222
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,599
those three things exceptionally well

1223
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,839
and i'll stand toe-to-toe with anybody

1224
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,599
and help and want to learn more myself

1225
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,440
but the only way that we are going to be

1226
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,599
able to change this is if we're able to

1227
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,519
help other countries because canada in

1228
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,240
many cases is beyond the point of no

1229
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,639
return unless you are able to

1230
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,000
really put a creative hat on and uh

1231
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,480
unfortunately i'm not going to publicly

1232
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,159
disclose that i'm here

1233
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,760
can i add something for that for germany

1234
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,519
we have the advantage here that we have

1235
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,680
an industry association that is

1236
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,838
representing the entire industry and

1237
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,598
that we are working across sections and

1238
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,440
it's not only affecting something that

1239
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,599
is for cannabis still the hemp is in a

1240
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,519
horrible situation and we need to do

1241
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,920
definitely some changes there and get it

1242
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,599
out of narcotics laws and just not only

1243
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
think about the recreational part but

1244
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,640
this is the important thing so if you're

1245
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,400
here in germany you want to make a

1246
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,920
difference please come and trust me

1247
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,318
afterwards and see how we can all

1248
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,960
collaborate and create this industry

1249
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:08,960
okay we can do

1250
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:14,639
[Music]

1251
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,969

[Music]

1253
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,118
because actually this morning we heard

1254
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,720
from three representatives from a

1255
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,960
coalition of government here who were

1256
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,799
saying in my mind all the right things

1257
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,159
things that we haven't heard in canada

1258
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,760
we didn't have a government saying that

1259
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:35,838
they support access to medical cannabis

1260
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,359
there should actually be more insurance

1261
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,599
coverage these are the things i was

1262
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,598
hearing this morning so i was interested

1263
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,838
if there's a consolidated plan coming

1264
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,680
from the industry association of how to

1265
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:47,759
protect medical cannabis

1266
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:48,639
post-legalization

1267
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,960
and

1268
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,799
whether uh in canada if we had that

1269
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
opportunity from some of the experts

1270
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,359
here if we can crush our cynicism for a

1271
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,960
minute and think about what uh we might

1272
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,000
have said to health canada if we had

1273
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,480
their ear

1274
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,880
like you may have here so can i answer

1275
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,318
that because i had two i had two very

1276
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,920
specific friends with health canada the

1277
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:08,960
last time i met them which i'm going to

1278
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,079
raise my hand and tell you it was

1279
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,039
pre-coded first and foremost um i don't

1280
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,359
believe the economics or long-term

1281
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,318
health of a medical product

1282
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,799
uh

1283
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:23,039
north of the equator are going to work

1284
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,680
and so in a country like canada where

1285
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,838
you were borrowing imports

1286
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,719
and so you're denying your patients

1287
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:33,199
access to affordable medical cannabis

1288
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,598
products that okay they weren't from or

1289
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:38,239
produced in canada but if they meet the

1290
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,318
same standards if they are held to the

1291
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,959
same obligations as canadian licensed

1292
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,599
producers then that medicine should be

1293
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,280
allowed to your patient so that's number

1294
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,920
one and number two

1295
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,599
um i argue with them about excess tax

1296
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,599
because we are

1297
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,359
taxing medical cannabis the same way we

1298
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,960
tax alcohol in canada today at very

1299
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,480
minimum i said if you're going to do

1300
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,720
that you should be taking that money and

1301
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,358
reinvesting it into the research in this

1302
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,199
country so that we can again ensure that

1303
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:08,799
our patients are getting the benefit of

1304
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,838
the funds that are flowing through this

1305
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,560
industry

1306
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,960
that's really interesting fantastic i'm

1307
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,960
trying to cut

1308
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,329
thank you so very much
