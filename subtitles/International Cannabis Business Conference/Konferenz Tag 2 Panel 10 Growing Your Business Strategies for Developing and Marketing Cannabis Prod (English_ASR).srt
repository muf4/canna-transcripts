35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,240
strategies for developing and marketing

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,658
cannabis products

37
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:40,039
and Beyond and before

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,799
um so the way I I want to look at it is

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,540
first if you want to enter the Cannabis

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,259
Market that can be a challenge per se

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,259
right so let's talk about the challenges

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,560
that you guys faced

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,978
just trying to be a part of that market

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,560
it's like just anyone how you feel well

45
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:04,920
I can I can start we um

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,019
we found we were founded we founded the

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,239
company in 2011

48
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,519
um before we had a first cannabis

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,259
product and in 2015 we that cannabis

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,180
product came along

51
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,179
um so the first things we learned is we

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,819
had to separate our websites because all

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,520
of a sudden Banks were saying well you

54
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:26,339
can't do business with you anymore

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,280
um so it's it's little things like that

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,560
along the way that that we've learned

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,719
yes so um I started in the business in

58
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,640
1314 doing compliance licensing for

59
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,639
clients and then moved into the testing

60
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,539
space pretty soon thereafter what we

61
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,359
found at first was actually for for many

62
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,159
of us it was actually fairly easy from

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,459
coming from industry I came from the

64
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,900
energy Consulting space coming in at

65
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,300
that time it was relatively easy

66
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,340
starting a company was relatively easy

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,080
getting licensed back then was

68
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,180
relatively easy but it very quickly got

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,300
very hard and it got very hard why

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,620
because competition started to increase

71
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,159
Regulators started really locking down

72
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,019
regulations and costs increased and then

73
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,000
of course Banks you know I had to open

74
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,800
reopen 12 bank accounts in the US as

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,199
well so multiple times over so it was

76
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,900
I would say the the real challenges that

77
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,299
would that emerged later largely were

78
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,580
regulatory and fitting into a

79
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,040
semi-illegal market

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,239
yeah and I think the the regulatory

81
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,098
aspect is something that's really

82
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,599
important to consider

83
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,098
um as you're starting a business as

84
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,658
you're thinking about getting products

85
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,238
to Market and whatever that market may

86
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:43,798
be whether it's the US Canada

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,780
um or or some of the other kind of more

88
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,459
Emerging Markets um it's really

89
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,919
important to understand the Regulatory

90
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,019
and just about in every Market uh maybe

91
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,579
aside from the US you're very limited in

92
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,860
terms of what you can do from a

93
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,599
marketing standpoint so you can almost

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,099
throw out you know all the different

95
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,679
playbooks that are out there for

96
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,959
Consumer good or medical good

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
um and you know my biggest advice you

98
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,200
know to you if you're starting up a

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,438
business or looking to get products to

100
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,479
Market is focus on the product all of

101
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,000
the bells and whistles of social media

102
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,918
and you know marketing agencies and you

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,798
know don't spend a ton of time or a ton

104
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,539
of money and resources on you know what

105
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,500
the brand is going to be what it looks

106
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,639
like

107
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,259
um you know what it feels like obviously

108
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,879
you need to have something that looks

109
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,979
well but the most important thing and

110
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,560
the most marketable thing that you're

111
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:33,300
going to have is your product it matters

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,519
what's inside the jar not necessarily

113
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,280
what the jar looks like and that is what

114
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,379
your consumers are going to remember to

115
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,239
put it in perspective decibel has a

116
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,939
brand called general admission it is by

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,019
far the largest brand product brand in

118
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,819
Canada

119
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,978
only two weeks ago did we have a

120
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,620
functioning website and that's not a

121
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,120
joke so we focused on the product being

122
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,399
Innovative with the products that we put

123
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,079
out understanding what the addressable

124
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,779
markets were and where their pockets of

125
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,939
volumes were and that allowed us to be

126
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,099
tremendously successful as we focused on

127
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,160
the product and how it was going to meet

128
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,560
our consumers needs and I think you can

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,780
still do that in all the sort of

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,000
different jurisdictions of of selling

131
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,758
and and marketing cannabis and that's

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,939
the biggest marketing tool all right so

133
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,180
just directly to that so your biggest

134
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,740
challenge then was product development

135
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,079
I think the big yeah the biggest

136
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,918
challenge is understanding

137
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,279
um

138
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,319
the right segments to go into and to

139
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,439
compete in and how do you find your Edge

140
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,879
in those you know sort of larger

141
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,279
um you know segments in the industry

142
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,100
that will allow you to be successful and

143
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,779
build a profitable company because you

144
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,879
know some of the products that sound

145
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,179
really great that you know may be more

146
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,159
of the the sort of the purest products

147
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:56,579
may not have a very wide sort of

148
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,919
consumer base and if you're building

149
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,599
really great products but they're really

150
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,758
expensive and they have a very low

151
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,500
addressable Market you're going to be

152
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,479
very challenged to build a successful

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,699
business

154
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,258
you know I think that the the the the

155
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,879
moderator here has talked a lot about

156
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,520
you know the beer industry and I agree

157
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,740
but the bill industry also has Brands

158
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,258
like Corona and Bud Light and Miller

159
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,000
Lite and those big Brands those aren't

160
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,160
the most sophisticated products

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,899
necessarily but they're the ones that

162
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,880
have the most broad appeal and you need

163
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,879
to really think about that as you're you

164
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,199
know building your business and you know

165
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,879
building your sort of product and

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,360
marketing strategy

167
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,639
yeah interesting so I like the the idea

168
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,319
of the wine actually but also because I

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,840
mean we live like in Germany like

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,000
alcohol is fairly

171
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,918
mildly regulated compared to other

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,839
environments right I mean you can buy

173
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,198
beer in every Supermarket if when you're

174
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:54,719
16. right and we're probably here at

175
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,060
somewhere tobacco same thing so some

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,699
in that venue here there might be a

177
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,459
tobacco vending machine so you'd still

178
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,020
have to swipe an ID card right but it's

179
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,698
like in some nightclubs but you're not

180
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,560
allowed to go in under 18 but this

181
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,439
doesn't even have that right so and so

182
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,860
it's so my my Approach was always to

183
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:17,279
regulation is not so much as

184
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,199
you know will cannabis be as wine like

185
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,659
regulate from a regulatory perspective

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,220
but what will the regulation of cannabis

187
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,919
will do to those Industries because

188
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,440
cannabis will be the most regulated drug

189
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,359
or legal drug in the beginning right

190
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,519
so let's talk about like and I think

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,280
regulation plays a big big part of this

192
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,079
so and and you all have faced regulatory

193
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,959
struggles probably

194
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,038
so I'd love to tap your mind on that

195
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,198
really so what would like the biggest

196
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,079
struggles how do you overcome them so

197
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,240
what's what's that so one thing I've

198
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,698
learned along the way and I would advise

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,098
others going into this business is is

200
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,840
first start out not only looking at the

201
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,000
federal and or state laws that are

202
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,939
coming out but also start early looking

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,339
at the other compliance areas look at

204
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,740
the GMP rules look at ISO rules don't

205
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,598
wait to hire a consultant to put a line

206
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,699
in your business plan hire JMP

207
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,899
consultant you know start today reading

208
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,579
what those rules are what those

209
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,879
requirements are and build your business

210
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,680
around that next once you've built your

211
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,918
business around these rules you've built

212
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,199
your Sops Sops are not shelfware and

213
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,878
they're not something that you write

214
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,160
somebody writes them all you win this

215
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,259
application yay it's exciting and you

216
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,020
train everybody the first time and then

217
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,820
people kind of forget they exist so you

218
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:36,538
really need to make sure those Sops are

219
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,959
true working documents and keeping your

220
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:43,218
teams on point reviewing those Sops and

221
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,419
modifying the Sops to match your actual

222
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,778
day-to-day operations is also really

223
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,778
important

224
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,159
from a yeah from a

225
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,600
you know building uh these facilities

226
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,100
perspective

227
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,720
um we're facing the same thing right

228
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,600
with GMP gacp uh in the US it's not even

229
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,639
a topic for most people some customers

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,100
that we talk to think a little bit into

231
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,139
the future but we as a provider of

232
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,959
buildings were actually dealing with an

233
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,059
international market where

234
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,859
designing building here in Europe we are

235
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:21,899
we have customers in Australia and New

236
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:24,360
Zealand in the Caribbean and because of

237
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,100
that you get exposed to different types

238
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,339
of regulations or different local

239
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,580
regulations different types of GMP and

240
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,440
gacp regulations and you also see that

241
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,080
there's different interpretation of

242
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,820
these regulations and so what we are

243
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,278
learning as a business is to essentially

244
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:48,300
not necessarily try to hit all these

245
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:49,799
rules but be prepared for our customers

246
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,079
that when we are building something in

247
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,659
the US that when and the Market opens up

248
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,399
in two three years that that facility

249
00:09:54,659 --> 00:10:00,000
still functions and that they can

250
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,419
upgrade it or add features so that they

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,458
can get those certifications when they

252
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:09,179
are needed and I think that little

253
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:10,739
foresight right is important in in the

254
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,719
business and what I want to turn it to

255
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,600
is

256
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,580
you can't do anything you can't do all

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,139
of this on your own you always need to

258
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,600
have a partner someone that you need to

259
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,458
work with right and you need to find the

260
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,379
right Partners as you are building your

261
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,799
business

262
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:31,320
that brings that expertise to the table

263
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:33,199
advises you and and helps you to get

264
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,459
there in the future yeah and look like

265
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,778
regulations are going to change and

266
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,458
they're going to change over time and

267
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,259
what we you start with is not what

268
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,958
you're going to end with by any stretch

269
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,639
and so a lot of mistakes that we've seen

270
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,139
in Canada and there's been a lot and

271
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,720
frankly we've made a lot of mistakes as

272
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,539
well as but one of the things that's so

273
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,060
important is building up personality and

274
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,578
flexibility into what you're doing so

275
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,018
you know as Chris was talking about you

276
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:59,939
know as he's building out facilities

277
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,700
he's offering to his clients you know

278
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,640
the optionality you know in case

279
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,920
GMP or jacp is going to be required for

280
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,259
that certain region that's a small

281
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,939
example and and don't getting married to

282
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,100
one idea because that's the way the

283
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,720
regulation is today

284
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,120
um you know there is going to be

285
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,440
Evolution that will create opportunity

286
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,839
but if you're bolted down into something

287
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,120
that becomes immovable because of it

288
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,700
becomes too much to invest to make the

289
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,379
change or you're essentially committed

290
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,778
into a certain strategy and then the

291
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,980
regulations change and you're not able

292
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:38,360
to Pivot and you're going to be left

293
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,399
behind so building in that flexibility

294
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,320
you know around your systems and around

295
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,539
whether it is your facility or strategy

296
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,160
is going to be so important but the

297
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,899
Bedrock of everything that you do I'll

298
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,480
go back to kind of my earlier comment

299
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,339
needs to be about the product about what

300
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,440
consumer you're trying to address and

301
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,899
what size of opportunity there and

302
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,180
always providing great value for money

303
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,559
and I don't mean cheap I mean for

304
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,838
whatever you're doing if you're the most

305
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,518
expensive product that's totally fine

306
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,220
but you need to provide the value that's

307
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,339
going to deliver against that and so

308
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,839
um that is where the regulation and the

309
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,940
restrictions and guidelines that are

310
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,740
coming out you just you need to you you

311
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,660
can use them to your advantage in a lot

312
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,220
of way and that is going to be a huge

313
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:22,500
strategic advantage of keeping your

314
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,259
business Nimble and able to react to

315
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,600
these changes that will more than likely

316
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:29,159
over time open up opportunities for your

317
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,379
business to flourish

318
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,480
yeah I would I would add to that too in

319
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,919
order to be flexible and to be and what

320
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,120
I've seen in the market with all the

321
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,958
clients that I've worked with over the

322
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,578
years

323
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,199
um those who are most focused in the

324
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:42,299
beginning tend to be the most successful

325
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,180
because if you want you may only have

326
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:47,399
one really fantastic product but it's

327
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,559
going rules are going to change

328
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,820
um you know your formulation is going to

329
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,979
change you're going to have personal

330
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,540
turnovers so you might get really

331
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,519
excited in the beginning I want to do a

332
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,599
whole line of products but that's 10 you

333
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,820
know that's multiple times the

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,800
complexity so staying really focused in

335
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,300
the beginning on doing one thing really

336
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,639
well and perfecting that before

337
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:08,159
replicating is also a lesson that I

338
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,200
learned early on oh that's I mean again

339
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,539
going back to Canada there's a lot of

340
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,040
chasing of shiny pennies

341
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,778
um you know we started in craft

342
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,519
cultivation that's still sort of our

343
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:19,919
hero product in a lot of ways with the

344
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,659
brand Quest but that gave us them

345
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,240
permission to go out and then we got

346
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,338
into the Vape category and then you know

347
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,019
there's a a nice line in sanction into

348
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,240
some other you know categories and sort

349
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,259
of doing things one of those time in a

350
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,240
way you know allowed us to stay focused

351
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:38,399
but also you know

352
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,919
build the businesses in such a way where

353
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,159
it can then sustain some more complexity

354
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,958
yeah I can I can double that I mean

355
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,939
Bovada is really just a one-trick pony

356
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,879
right we only have one product in

357
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,160
different variations but that's it so

358
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,259
for us the challenge was you know you

359
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,299
build it for let's say like a

360
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,559
recreational Market all of a sudden you

361
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,699
have customers that are in the medicinal

362
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,679
Market

363
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,240
and he's like oh they have moisture

364
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,120
regulations you have to build around

365
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,879
that and they have GMP and all these

366
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,639
type of things for instance for us a U.S

367
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,759
company and we we Source everything

368
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,680
United States will never be EU GMP

369
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,078
because all of our supplies would also

370
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,939
have to be eugnp since we Source United

371
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,359
States we can't do it so we'll have to

372
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,339
build a production line over here to

373
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,200
achieve that and so on and so on and so

374
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,639
on so

375
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,519
um but yet still GMP FDA GMP so there's

376
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,039
ways around it some places

377
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,419
um but you know but the focus Point what

378
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,919
you what you guys mentioned I think is

379
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:44,939
very important right you have to be

380
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:48,838
really good in your core service or

381
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,420
product right all right so how do you so

382
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,420
you have a product or service

383
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:58,939
the next thing is you're not alone

384
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,939
right so how do you differentiate

385
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,359
I mean my perspective on it is one of

386
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,519
the things that we've done really well

387
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,399
is customer service

388
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,799
um you know to me it's making sure you

389
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,198
have a really great product

390
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,179
um that serves you know and basically

391
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,578
serves a consumer need and consumer

392
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,099
tensions but it's followed up with

393
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:22,620
customer service I think those who are

394
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,360
in you know sort of more emerging I call

395
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,519
them Emerging Markets like Germany and

396
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,039
Australia and the UK and some of the

397
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,198
others that that are making headlines

398
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,259
um unfortunately what a lot of Canadian

399
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,879
LPS are doing or or or or kind of other

400
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,220
LPS that are exporting into these

401
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,019
markets is they're basically dumping and

402
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,639
running essentially they've made the

403
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,019
sale they've got product move over and

404
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,778
then it's kind of wiped their hands and

405
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,799
and move on

406
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:49,620
servicing your customer and that like

407
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,198
that's it sounds like so basic but it's

408
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,539
amazing how much that is not done and

409
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,519
understanding and being there for them

410
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:57,958
and following up and problem solving

411
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,000
when things don't go right because let's

412
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,179
face it it's cannabis and it's a very

413
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,379
fickle plant you know and and every once

414
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,479
in a while something is going to go

415
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,578
wrong and it's how you back that up by

416
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,039
being there and being Partners in what

417
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:12,899
you're doing and actually making sure

418
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,299
that you provide that great service so

419
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:18,120
to me that that is the second way to

420
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,458
stand out is having exceptional product

421
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,620
that is consistent as you can get that

422
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,838
is innovative in addressing consumers

423
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,459
needs and then following it up with

424
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,019
customer service and just doing what you

425
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,219
say you're going to do and

426
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,320
um you know that seems to be a very

427
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,600
novel Concept in cannabis

428
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,459
and yeah and I think it's funny right

429
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,379
listening to Adam

430
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:41,278
um you're looking at it from the plan

431
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:43,740
perspective and bringing the plant into

432
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:47,100
a product that you then sell to

433
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,500
customers and it's it's a very similar

434
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,620
story for us uh you know that's that's

435
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,720
so funny I mean we have as a product we

436
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,179
have a product That's Unique worldwide

437
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,680
we have patents and we have IP to

438
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,939
protect that and protect it into the

439
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:06,720
future but that's the core of it right

440
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:09,179
then on top of that the focus is on

441
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,860
delivering that consistent product in

442
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,798
our case it's those greenhouses to our

443
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:16,318
customers a big thing that we realized

444
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,480
early on is also customer service

445
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,918
because when you build a facility like

446
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,360
this

447
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,000
um you can't just

448
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,818
run away after that customers do not

449
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,798
know how to run it so we started

450
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:31,678
essentially incorporating into our

451
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:35,099
contracts a

452
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:39,120
an offering that we stay engaged with

453
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:42,918
our customers to make sure that they get

454
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:45,719
what they bought from us with regards to

455
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,220
the outcome how that environment is

456
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,919
controlled how those rooms and those

457
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,319
systems are functioning and

458
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,640
um and it's the same story right it's

459
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,399
just I mean we're doing a completely

460
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,500
different business and we're supplying

461
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,600
cannabis Growers but the story behind it

462
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,599
the business terms are very similar

463
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,919
yeah do you want to add something

464
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,659
no I'm fine so I don't know just because

465
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,900
I I

466
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,759
so it's customer service it's probably

467
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,960
not just limited to the Cannabis

468
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,259
industry per se that's more like a

469
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,058
general truth I reckon unless you wanted

470
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,000
to say something else he's like no

471
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:26,399
customer service sucks don't do it

472
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,919
um is that is that kind of like also

473
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,419
like the pathway into like real Customer

474
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,799
Loyalty because that's what we're all

475
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,740
looking for right we want loyal

476
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:38,579
customers

477
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:41,940
starting maybe all right okay sure so um

478
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:43,980
in in my area we we provided B2B

479
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,720
services but I also worked with a number

480
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,099
of customers that had

481
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,819
um

482
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,798
um

483
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,779
product I watched the product

484
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,700
development process of companies so I

485
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,619
saw them from the formulation stage

486
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,940
through the development stage

487
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,678
um and I saw which products were

488
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,460
successful and which were not and I

489
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,038
think

490
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,480
of course the quality point is most

491
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,640
important you know you have quality of

492
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,919
focus on one product and really getting

493
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,660
that feedback from customers

494
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,880
um I would just I would just say that

495
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,220
it's it's it is like virtually any other

496
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,480
products that that's really what it

497
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,640
comes down to is making sure you're

498
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,058
really hyper focused on the customer and

499
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,980
as as it comes to the competitors uh I

500
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,240
think if you if you really focused on

501
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,339
your customer listen to your customer

502
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,319
and if they go to a competitor ask them

503
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,939
why did they go to that competitor and

504
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,019
work with them from that way really

505
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,919
develop those relationships so yeah it's

506
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,918
customer service

507
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,538
I would actually take that another a

508
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,418
step further and again that's from

509
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:48,480
personal experience but but you can look

510
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,280
at customer service as part of a p l and

511
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,019
say you know I've got to be profitable

512
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,720
right and I'm gonna you know put a

513
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:59,220
number in there and and once I've once

514
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,860
I've used up that number I'm done right

515
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,679
um that doesn't work in an industry like

516
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,538
cannabis where

517
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,940
where the mistakes are being made right

518
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:11,879
I mean Adam just mentioned it we know

519
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,340
that there are suppliers there's you

520
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,380
know problems with the builders and in

521
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,879
our case there's different regulations

522
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,220
in different countries and knowledge

523
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,840
that's there or not there

524
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:26,940
um if we don't engage with our customers

525
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:29,099
Beyond just looking at a p l and just

526
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,380
saying look it doesn't matter this

527
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:35,279
customer needs to be successful

528
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,600
um then we will not survive and I would

529
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,058
go that far

530
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:42,719
and I mean customer service sounds so

531
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:45,178
you know cliche but it just is not

532
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,120
happening in a very meaningful way in

533
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:50,460
cannabis I don't think and I think parts

534
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,459
of the problems that you see in some

535
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,620
cannabis companies failing is that the

536
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,900
folks in the c-suite who are making

537
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:59,459
decisions aren't aware of what's being

538
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,019
said about their product about their

539
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,740
business

540
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:07,558
um and you know it it just it goes such

541
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,900
a long way like you know myself and our

542
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,240
head of marketing product who's here

543
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,160
with me today we used to answer the the

544
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,419
customer emails that's on the label of

545
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,980
every one of our products we used to

546
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,080
personally do that that's not scalable

547
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,759
for us to do that all the time but it's

548
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,139
still an inbox in our Outlook that we

549
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,240
look at every single day to understand

550
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,620
what when stuff is going wrong what are

551
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,960
consumers saying and then how can we fix

552
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:30,538
that or is there an opportunity in these

553
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,819
things and it's it's amazing when you

554
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:34,798
actually respond back and say hey you're

555
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,200
right that's not great here's how I'm

556
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,179
going to fix this for you or you know we

557
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,679
you know have customer you know big

558
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,960
customer in Israel where we ship our

559
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,480
product you know something wasn't

560
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,759
looking or feeling right and flew over

561
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,319
there the next day and walked them you

562
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,819
know walked through it and you know made

563
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,639
a solution that that fit for everybody

564
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:56,639
and so you have to go above and beyond

565
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,500
to support it because they'll remember

566
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,140
that and it becomes easier when things

567
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,279
you know don't go right all the time

568
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,559
that you can overcome them and you're

569
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,839
not losing a piece of business and so it

570
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,399
sounds really simple but just showing up

571
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,959
and being there and doing what you're

572
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,659
going to say it's a very simple business

573
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,400
but it's also not being done enough in

574
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,380
cannabis and I think that's also what is

575
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,259
really hurting our our industry as well

576
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,179
with with some less than I say quality

577
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,879
actors yeah if I could add to that too

578
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,440
it may be that we're not budgeting

579
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
customer service the way we should we're

580
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,700
putting in this big marketing budget

581
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,140
maybe it's 10 15 20 you know revenue is

582
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,200
marketing but what is marketing

583
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,780
marketing is keeping the existing

584
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,298
customers happy and perhaps that's a gap

585
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:42,720
that we're not really focused on on

586
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:44,339
investing into the customer service area

587
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,259
all right so it's

588
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,720
to summarize it's kind of like a simple

589
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:51,720
business and a complicated regulated

590
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,058
world right I mean I think that's fair I

591
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,860
mean in in a lot of ways it has been

592
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:58,558
over

593
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,119
uh or may have been made overly complex

594
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,220
like don't get me wrong it is a

595
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,319
tremendously complex and capital

596
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,380
intensive business like there's there's

597
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:10,139
no question but I think in all that it's

598
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,020
very easy to get lost

599
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,000
uh in the fundamentals right or or have

600
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:17,700
the fundamentals be lost of

601
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,240
really damn good product big addressable

602
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,558
Market service your customer well like

603
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,298
there's no secret I'm not saying

604
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,839
anything revolutionary here but I think

605
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:29,819
because it moves so quick because the

606
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,399
regulations can be very confusing and

607
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,200
changing all the time and there's a

608
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,900
whole bunch of different Theses and

609
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,900
approaches to this industry that those

610
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,960
key elements can really get lost and

611
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,820
um if you do those things well

612
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,038
um you know then then I think you can

613
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,019
really be successful and and I you know

614
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,359
I think decibel is a great example is

615
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,220
we're profitable we're growing we're

616
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,779
cash flowing and there's not really any

617
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,339
Canadian licensed producers out there

618
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,678
that can really say the same

619
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,058
yeah we were joking which was like oh

620
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,100
you're that one profitable company in

621
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:05,038
Canada Okay so

622
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,839
um because time is running low

623
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,519
are there any questions from the

624
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,519
audience now's a chance

625
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:17,700
no you have taught them everything they

626
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,919
need to know you think good job good

627
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,240
well thank you all for being here thank

628
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,240
