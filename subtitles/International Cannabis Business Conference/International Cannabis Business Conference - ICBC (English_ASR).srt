3
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,210
this is international business companies

4
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,950
and many people who came here kind of

5
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,380
took a chance bought a ticket wasn't

6
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,510
sure what to expect right and the

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,700
feedback I'm getting is I can't believe

8
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:51,390
this I didn't know what was going to be

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,560
this good what they mean by good is

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:01:07,030
information and networking and just a

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:07,960
gentle attitude of the people here and I

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,469
believe in karma

13
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:14,500
I believe in community I believe in love

14
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:15,909
and understanding and I actually believe

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,159
if you hold true to some of those tenets

16
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,989
and precepts that you're only going to

17
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,209
benefit yourself for so many reasons and

18
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:23,949
in my case it's actually helped me make

19
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:26,259
money also so it's it's no win-win

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,868
situation that's happening with the

21
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,769
cannabis industry in particular and I

22
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:31,569
think that's what people are very

23
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:34,569
surprised about that that they can make

24
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:36,849
money they can be successful and no one

25
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,529
else has still to lose we just wrapped

26
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:40,719
it up here at the International cannabis

27
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,090
business conference in a fantastic time

28
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,159
Steve bloom from celeb stoner and

29
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,270
freedom leaf magazine was here Steve

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,009

31
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:51,099
Ethan Adelman from the drug policy

32
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:52,899
Alliance gave an impassioned impassioned

33
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:55,928
speech about what we need to do if

34
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:57,819
people are actually overly excited and

35
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:00,609
happy that we have decided to dedicate

36
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:04,509
so much of this to culture politics and

37
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:06,409
advocacy and I'm tremendously happy with

38
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,318
the feedback

39
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,810
never doubt a small group of concerned

40
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,208
citizens can change the world

41
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,479
it is indeed the only thing that ever

42
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,479
has
