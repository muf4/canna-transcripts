Public

16
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,799
Partnerships uh cannabis is an

17
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:01,479
interesting topic uh in terms of uh

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,439
public and private partnersh ships um

19
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,079
there's there's a few Nuance uh

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,319
different uh things that go on with uh

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,798
uh traditionally cannabis companies

22
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,839
private uh uh private companies with

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,040
Public Partnerships however the analogy

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,920
is intact and we have a panel of

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,079
esteemed experts uh today that are going

26

Partnerships in general in Slovenia and

28
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:30,279
then we can find cor laries within that

29
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,719
of how that can be analogous to uh the

30

Cannabis industry as well so I'd like to

dko I'd like to uh start with you and uh

55

ask um uh when we talk public private

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,519
Partnerships what what do you think are

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
some what's the most what are the most

58
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,629
important types of relationships that

59
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,119
can happen with regards to

60
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:51,919
[Music]

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,400
that okay well hello from my side as

62
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,158
well uh nice public here a lot of

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,680
interesting discussion going on

64
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:00,719
especially from a legal perspective

65
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,120
regarding I mean my let's say interest

66
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,318
here um yeah talking about PPP I mean

67
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,599
it's uh it's very I would say broad

68
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,518
subject really and um uh I mean I don't

69
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,199
think it's idea that we go into details

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,239
what kind of possibilities are here

71
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,079
possible but I mean for me uh what I

72
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,680
know now about this industry you know

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,959
that you are representing uh here I

74
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,680
think it would be so important to

75
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,680
improve and en llarge

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,560
research because uh I understand a lot

77
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,879
of things haven't been properly

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,598
researched yet regarding cannabis I

79
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,919
think this is the most important issue

80
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:38,560
really so whatever you know cooperation

81
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,958
even you know I would I would go broader

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,319
than just PPP you know because PPP could

83
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,400
be quite uh specific you have different

84
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,798
forums different legal I would say

85
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,158
contracts Etc maybe colleagues can go

86
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,920
more deeper into that but for me it will

87
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,878
be really important to to improve

88
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,158
cooperation between research institutes

89
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,598
which let's say in countries like

90
00:03:55,158 --> 00:04:00,519
Slovenia are mostly public so that would

91
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,438
be public part of this Corporation and

92
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,079
of course you guys that you do business

93
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,280
uh regarding cannabis would you know

94
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,280
benefit from this research and of course

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,878
you would cooperate so it would be kind

96
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,719
of cooperation so win-win situation I

97
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,439
would say and through that you know

98
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,279
maybe I can go later on into that a

99
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,680
little bit uh through that I even claim

100
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,638
maybe at this point theoretically you

101
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,959
could get some EU funding for that you

102
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,600
know because uh there aren't any I would

103
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,198
say tenders calls in in Brussels

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,199
regarding cannabis as such however there

105
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,080
are calls regarding medicine Health Etc

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,280
so whatever Innovation you bring into

107
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,560
that you can get funding so you wouldn't

108
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,559
be able to go for a certain area because

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,759
there isn't area cannabis there within

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,839
those calls but there are as I said

111
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,319
Innovative Health projects and I mean

112
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:00,000
deepening research in this area could be

113
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,478
potentially also legit for for certain

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,959
EU funding and is is that also the case

115
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,959
not just for biom medicine but for hemp

116
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,519
Also let's say for Eco Solutions like

117
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,879
making a more environmentally friendly

118
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,680
building material for example I meant

119
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,680
first of all like medical part but of

120
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
course mentioning this I mean if

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,759
somebody I don't know we had this uh

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,439
batteries issue right it was introduced

123
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,639
in lublana in in in the in the

124
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,319
parliament even you know so using let's

125
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,079
say cannabis in batteries then maybe

126
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,000
when you talk about green economy there

127
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,800
are possib is their agriculture you know

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,038
I mean I think all this should be more

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,079
introduced in Brussels as well in order

130
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,079
to to get certain more I would say

131
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,680
precise reaction from European

132
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,918
Commission because right now uh by the

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,519
way preparing that our event on the 15th

134
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,680
of May next year in Brussels with the

135
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,758
idea to you know put that on map in

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,360
Brussels more uh how should I say more

137
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,879
precisely uh uh so I think this this is

138
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,919
really important you know so really to

139
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,120
put broad picture what all cannabis can

140
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,758
be used for and of course uh medical

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,478
part is probably the most important but

142
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,280
not necessarily it's it's it's important

143
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,959
to put all this on the table that's uh

144
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,839
very interesting I I agree and and just

145
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,038
the last thing I apologize maybe just

146
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,638
that uh uh so preparing this event for

147
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,279
the next year 15th of May in Brussels I

148
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,720
also learned that let's say whatever you

149
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:29,598
ask commission about cannabis right now

150
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,400
they are very very cautious about it so

151
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,800
nobody wants to say anything really

152
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,318
direct so maybe with the new commission

153
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,598
coming up there's a chance and I think

154
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,360
it's good timing next year may yeah to

155
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:43,759
get more from them yeah that's great

156
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,360
we've uh josco and I are planning a

157
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,560
disruptive event in Brussels on May 15th

158
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,319
on private Public Partnerships and we're

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
basically it's a it's a Lobby effort of

160
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,919
sorts for the policies that sort of

161
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,478
stuff yeah exactly very interesting grco

162
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,758
so we'll need lawyers these good lawyers

163

you're

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,959
there um Boston uh uh I should say GOP

169
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,360
because we have two Bost um on the panel

170
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,519
um uh that Segways into what are the

171
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,800
various ways uh in which the public and

172
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,680
private sectors collaborate in the field

173
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,280
of research and development can you

174
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,079
expound on that a little bit yeah thank

175
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,878
you thank you for invitation uh I think

176
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,198
that pppc is only one way uh we

177
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,000
shouldn't forget the traditional way

178
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,560
that is subsidies most of the EU funds

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,759
came to the subsidies

180
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,839
agriculture uh research Health and so on

181
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:49,280
so subsidies is the first pillar and

182
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:53,079
maybe combination subsid of subsidies

183
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:56,079
private funds could make ppps work uh

184
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:58,680
next pillar or next layer I think it's

185
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,120
very important also that you focus a

186
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,038
little bit on public procurement because

187
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,000
public procurement is uh public

188
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:12,759
authorities are huge buyers and if you

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,680
can uh sell them Goods services this is

190
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,400
huge market and that will make the

191
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,759
confidence on the market for other

192
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:26,198
buyers higher and easier to to purchase

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,960
the same Goods uh and then I think came

194
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,200
the PPP which is the most complex uh uh

195
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,958
part of uh

196
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,278
collaboration uh because of two reasons

197
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:42,518
first reason is that you always have to

198
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:45,120
some sort establish public interest

199
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,278
what's public interest in PPP health

200
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,560
issues I don't know

201
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:53,519
agriculture some research education

202
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,838
whatever and this is always a political

203
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,320
question public interest is always a

204
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,360
political question because I know in

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,760
Slovenia that makes I know uh government

206
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,320
degree or city council decision or

207
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,679
something like that so it's political

208
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,720
question the other part is the transfer

209
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:14,879
of risks if we have PPP contract we have

210
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,560
to deal about identification of risk

211
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,559
allocation of risk and who will take

212
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,199
this risk through the different pro

213
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,278
project stages so these are two main

214
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,519
questions but the biggest obstacle uh

215
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,039
when you are preparing the PPP project

216
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,039
is always not only on this specific

217
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,199
topic that you're talking about in this

218
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,078
conference but also in public

219
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,839
infrastructure or public services is the

220
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:43,639
public opinion public opinion is against

221
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,800
ppps because that means privatization

222
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,799
that means profit for privates and so

223
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:53,719
like that but this is not the real idea

224
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:56,599
of ppps the idea of ppps is to combine

225
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,000
resources knowledge funds and everything

226
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,320
to get something added value to get

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,120
added value and do you do you think that

228
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,360
Slovenia is changing a little bit their

229
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
attitude and understanding the

230
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,039
importance of the private sector and

231
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,519
Entrepreneurship okay I think that on

232
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,319
the government level we didn't change a

233
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,440
bit we are

234
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:21,480
still mostly in the I don't know

235
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,360
public uh institutes and public founding

236
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,879
subsidies are the main uh way of

237
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,879
financing but on the municipality on

238
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,838
local level we can see some mayors that

239
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,679
are more

240
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,200
Innovative they are more open to to new

241
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,958
projects and what we as a Consultants

242
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,879
did we changed the name of the project

243
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:44,239
we are not speaking about PPP anymore we

244
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,759
are speaking about I don't know energy

245
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,720
Contracting or some other smart some

246
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:54,679
other name that basically is legally PPP

247
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,720
but it sounds much better so are there

248
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,519
more are there some opt options in

249
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
Slovenia then that are more open to this

250
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,959
type of Cooper a and more Nimble and

251
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,120
adaptive yes I think I know lublana is

252
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,799
one of the examples Crown here nearby is

253
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,639
also NOA there are some some

254
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,399
municipalities they are quite open and

255
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,959
they see that ppps could be one

256
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,399
alternative to the traditional way to uh

257
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,599
to develop quicker and easier than and

258
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,480
even some very small ones even small

259
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,320
ones you know small cities or so you

260
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,920
know practicing that a little bit and

261
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,760
but if I may say a short joke you know

262
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,639
how Slovenian you know understand PPP

263
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,200
you know so uh public sector will give

264
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,720
infrastructure money and private sector

265
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,800
will just take

266
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,959
money that's what the that's what the

267
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,559
narrative is right that's not many think

268
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,559
you know but of course we have to turn

269
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,078
it around and you said you know I think

270
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,638
it's it's great potential there where

271
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,359
I'm from in America we actually look at

272
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,440
it kind of as the opposite it's just the

273
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,278
the government that's on the take and

274
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,800
the privateers are trying they don't

275
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:04,439
succeed unless everybody succeeds around

276
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,519
the private part private part would not

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,560
go into PPP if if he she doesn't see you

278
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,519
know potential profit or quite sure

279
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,278
profit for sure so let's so let's take

280
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:19,198
it back really quick to your first prong

281
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:20,919
you said was subsidies right now um

282
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,519
would would would would you be also of

283
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:25,799
the opinion that a PPP is a more

284
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,679
sustainable model once you get it going

285
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:32,559
than subsidies per se basically I no I

286
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,919
can I can give you the example of Energy

287
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:38,399
Efficiency there was a lot of projects

288
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:41,278
in Slovenia of refurbishing the old

289
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,159
public buildings and we combine EU funds

290
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:47,120
but it's subsidy and private funds and

291
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:51,000
do it really quickly and efficiently I

292
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,440
don't know a lot of projects all around

293
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,198
Slovenia on the on the municipality

294
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,399
level but interesting on the government

295
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:01,719
level I don't remember one project that

296
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,198
can be successfully uh

297
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,920
presented I was I was I was hoping you

298
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,479
wouldn't say that may I jump in with one

299
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,599
sentence so that's why European Union is

300
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,560
projecting for the next uh budget which

301
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,800
is starting on on the in the uh 2028 but

302
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,439
it's planned already now more let's say

303
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,719
private part so these subsidies will go

304
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,480
down if now let's say certain projects

305
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,720
are financed 70% from EU funding in

306
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,440
future there will be maybe 60 % in order

307
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,320
that private part would give more into

308
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,880
the project through that you can somehow

309
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,839
get more let's say guarantee that

310
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,198
project will be successful and the

311
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,720
private part will put everything in not

312
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,559
just money but also all other resources

313
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,240
that makes too much sense yeah it does

314
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,638
uh BOS John uh uh so you're the

315
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Privateer here with the business um what

316
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,320
does it look like on the business side

317
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,480
of things I know you've started a very

318
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,079
big project called biotech Hills um and

319
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,600
which has to do with a lot of what we're

320
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:07,439
talking about could you expound on that

321
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,320
a bit Yeah so uh thanks and uh obviously

322
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,639
great to see lots of faces and some

323
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,199
familiar faces as well in the room um so

324
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,759
maybe just just a little bit of intro of

325
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:22,039
of what we do um please I come from uh

326
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,039
labena labena is a family company um

327
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,360
well established not just in Slovenia

328
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,399
but internationally here in the region

329
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,639
we operate internationally or globally

330
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:33,159
we do um our main focus is research and

331
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,278
development uh services for

332
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:39,399
pharmaceutical uh and bi Biotech

333
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:41,159
Industry um uh we have also Laboratories

334
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,720
here in Slovenia where where we are

335
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:47,679
based we have the biggest part of

336
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:51,040
operations here um and maybe I'll

337
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:54,120
um what we started in the in the in

338
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:59,519
labena years ago and that was in

339
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:01,480
2007 uh before I joined um I so I myself

340
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,639
spent a lot of time in abroad and

341
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,399
actually um working in big

342
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,600
pharmaceutical uh companies GSK Nova

343
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,120
Nordisk OTA Pharma which is a Japanese

344
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,199
company um and worked actually already a

345
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,000
lot abroad on private public initiatives

346
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:23,799
or Partnerships um um we in labina

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,240
started doing that in 2007 as part of um

348
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,958
research uh collaboration especially we

349
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,839
we we uh became Research Institute as

350
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,758
well institution and hence we also

351
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,040
operate not just for profit but we

352
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,560
operate to generate science and science

353
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,759
that can be potentially translated to

354
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,919
commercial opportunities and now to tie

355
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,560
into um so we have quite a bit of

356
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:49,838
experience um working with with the

357
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,799
public sector and working with the

358
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,079
public sector not just on projects but

359
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,278
significant initiatives I think is key

360
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,599
and why is it key that there are two

361
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,879
things so first of all

362
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,240
and I'm I'm going to say this a little

363
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,838
bit against obviously someone who's

364
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,639
coming from a private sector working

365
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,399
with the public sector keeps the the

366
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,318
private um interests a little bit in

367
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,198
check in terms of that if you

368
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:21,120
collaborate um with the public sector

369
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:23,240
you you have to kind of look look from a

370
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,759
broader perspective of Interest as well

371
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,198
it forces you to do that um but it gives

372
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,240
you the leverage of actually um

373
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,120
obviously higher impact and influence

374
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,240
which you cannot achieve as a smaller

375
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,519
you know or a limit or limited Private

376
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Business uh so it is very important and

377
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:47,039
um I would say that um this is um if you

378
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,799
want to build an ecosystem which I think

379
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,759
in the world of cannabis would be

380
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:55,120
extremely important uh and when I talk

381
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,360
about ecosystems I I mean all players

382
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,240
combined within an within a territory

383
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,240
that can be country it can be a region

384
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,798
it can be even Europe working together

385
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,640
to achieve something it is it is

386
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:08,918
inevitable that you have to work in a

387
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,959
private public

388
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,799
partnership and this is kind of what we

389
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,199
learned from experience in laena this is

390
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,759
why we um we got together with some of

391
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,038
the other partners um and I'll tie into

392
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:25,119
into uh cannabis industry here as well

393
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:27,519
um to to form uh just a few months ago

394
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,000
the idea about forming an Institute or a

395
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:35,319
platform to to make sure that we can get

396
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,599
together uh policy makers um so get

397
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,839
behind the same T policy makers Academia

398
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:44,000
institutes uh and obviously private

399
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:46,720
entities to be able to effectuate change

400
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,519
in in in this space and this was the

401
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,919
initiative of Slovenia biotic Hills so

402
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,879
Slovenia biotic kills it's a it's zot

403
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:58,320
it's I would translate institutes

404
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,679
basically um and we we it was actually

405
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,839
um uh we signed a memorandum of

406
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,000
understanding with the with the

407
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,519
government of Slovenia with the minister

408
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,359
of Slovenia actually right in this room

409
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,639
exactly two weeks ago where you sit um

410
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:15,399
just right there in that corner

411
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,080
um uh whereby we agreed on on certain

412
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,880
metrics to make sure that we together

413
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:25,599
Elevate the the the prosperity and added

414
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,120
value of Economy based on development of

415
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,798
one of the most important sectors in

416
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,399
Slovenia with the probably the longest

417
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:36,038
tradition um and added value currently

418
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,240
which is the biotech sector um and

419
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:41,079
cannabis inevitably Falls within the

420
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,519
biotech because there is you know when

421
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:46,798
you are when you manufacture a product

422
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,000
where by whereby cannabis as as a plant

423
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,079
is a base um you go through a

424
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,798
biotechnological process inevitably or

425
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,960
where you developing products from from

426
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:59,319
Cannabis so it very much sits in this

427
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,558
domain and um why we think the public

428
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,119
private partnership is important um it's

429
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,000
not only to secure finding actually the

430
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,359
first question we got was do you want

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,038
more money from the government is that

432
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:13,119
why you did it and the answer was um

433
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,400
well eventually yes but not directly we

434
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,719
don't want to be subsidized what we want

435
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,360
to do is develop conditions policies tax

436
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,839
policies policies to attract skilled

437
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:26,399
labor force into Slovenia policies to um

438
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,000
introduce levies for uh in Innovative

439
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,679
startups which can be startups in

440
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,960
cannabis or B Tech um so that they will

441
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,159
set their footprint in Slovenia we want

442
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,319
to put Slovenia on the map on the on the

443
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,840
on the global map when somebody thinks

444
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,839
biotechnology Slovenia is on the list of

445
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,319
countries where you would want to you

446
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,000
would want to put your manufacturing

447
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:51,839
plant um or R&amp;D capabilities that that

448
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,159
is the ambition and cannabis uh pertains

449
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:57,480
to that and and and so I kind of see

450
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,559
ppps in a much broader sense Beyond just

451
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,360
the project but actually initi Ives that

452
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:06,319
will drive increased added value for

453
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,240
Citizens living in a certain um

454
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:11,079
geography that that can be Slovenia or

455
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,000
it can be a wider geography um and I

456
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,599
will just say I mean because we you

457
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,279
asked me about the initiative so the

458
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,199
initiative itself it's called Slovenia

459
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:23,399
by kills but really the vision is that

460
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,519
we um we give um we kind of create an

461
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,320
environment in connections and

462
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,158
collaborations and networks through

463
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:30,720
central eastern Europe

464
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,480
uh so that central eastern Europe

465
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,159
becomes a more recognizable Hub through

466
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,319
Slovenia as well uh for for biotech

467
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,440
Innovation including cannabis industry

468
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:43,279
um so that's kind of sorry and that

469
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,159
sounds amazing I mean I love to hear

470
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,279
that it's a very entrepreneurial

471
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,880
attitude it's a very what I would

472
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,319
consider real progressivism talking

473
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,840
about how will we incentivize people to

474
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,759
come to Slovenia how will we partner

475
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,798
with the with the government with the

476
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,200
policy makers with all the players to to

477
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,440
have things like uh incentives like I

478
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,558
love the idea of incentivizing but not

479
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,278
subsidizing because that means it's

480
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:14,038
actually sustainable right and this is a

481
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:15,880
I think this is crucial and this is hard

482
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,359
when you come from the European social

483
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,120
State mentality um it's hard to break

484
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,599
that and and because it's like I

485
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,839
remember years ago and I'll just say

486
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,158
something quick before I go to the next

487
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,678
question but years ago I was listening

488
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,240
to National Public Radio and uh they

489
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,640
were talking about non profits and how

490
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,319
the model of nonprofits have had had

491
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,320
changed previously if your nonprofit

492
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,399
raised

493
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:41,960
$300,000 80% of that money goes

494
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,240
immediately has to go to to or at least

495
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,840
80% maybe 90 has to go to do do but

496
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,839
you can't reinvest money that you get

497
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,599
donated for a nonprofit but now uh and

498
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:53,720
this one particular show was talking

499
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:56,000
about how this guy would come to

500
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,600
nonprofit and say well let's take let's

501
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,119
take $20,000 and throw throw an event

502
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,079
and a fundraiser and see if we can't

503
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,199
with some of that money that was donated

504
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,720
create more money and more like a

505
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,080
business would do not a nonprofit who is

506
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,880
just depending on subsidies or or

507
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,519
donations for example so I always think

508
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,799
of that that listening to that maybe 20

509
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,000
years ago as a big change in because I

510
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:20,918
related to that CU I think if you're a

511
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,480
practical logical person you want to you

512
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:26,038
want to grow in a and a in a human who

513
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,038
wants to evolve and develop you want to

514
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,759
grow you want to be proud of what you do

515
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,359
right and and so I think that's the

516
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,158
that's one of the most in interesting

517
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,278
things um that we could mention now is

518
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,360
that almost that shift in mentality of

519
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:41,200
hey we got to be more responsible but

520
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,639
there's more and the maybe there's some

521
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,360
risk too but the reward is there and the

522
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,480
and the sustainability is there as you

523
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,199
build Brick by Brick not just get a

524
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,480
brick then take the brick away then a

525
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,880
new brick then take the brick away um uh

526
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,798
Boston uh uh uh uh Mr fck are you aware

527
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,520
of any notable examples of public

528
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,480
private partnership in the areas of

529
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,720
innovation research and development in

530
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,400
Slovenia specifically that you could

531
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,679
talk about basically we have one very

532
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,840
interesting micro PPP here nearby from

533
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:18,798
cran uh city of the cran uh they have

534
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:21,399
the privately founded uh Institute that

535
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:24,119
research human fish this is a cave

536
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,640
animal living only in the cross region

537
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,558
it's also a a brand of a beer now but uh

538
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,360
they are focused in on

539
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:36,639
the environmental influence of this

540
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,119
species very rare species uh and they

541
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,400
have for 60 years they have problems

542
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,719
with funding and there was always

543
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,919
struggling for public funds and there

544
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,720
was a big challenge how to make some

545
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:53,400
self-driven model self- sustainable

546
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:57,600
model uh to make their work visible

547
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:01,400
public and to make it uh also a business

548
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:03,359
model that will will cover costs and U

549
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,720
they make the cooperation with

550
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,798
Municipality of cran uh because this is

551
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,880
a cave animal we use Old Second World

552
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:16,278
War tunnel which is under the the city

553
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,600
uh this was the input from the city uh

554
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:21,200
and the guys from The Institute they

555
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:24,359
present the exhibition uh life animals

556
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,880
and everything and we prepare the the

557
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:31,119
new uh tourist attraction that creates

558
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,760
money invite people buying tickets with

559
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:37,000
these tickets we will finance the cost

560
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,359
of the new attraction but also the The

561
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,960
Profit will go for research so you can

562
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,639
do it on the micro level you can do it

563
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,640
also in the higher scale it's even

564
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,200
easier because business cases are better

565
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,159
that's uh amazing and and

566
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,278
dko do you want do you have something to

567
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:56,200
add to that actually yeah I mean PPP is

568
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:59,159
is let's say more complex to achieve but

569
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,919
it gives of course more uh security for

570
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,600
both sides actually you know so that's

571
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,278
that's I also understood you wanted to

572
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:07,719
to show that before with your cases

573
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:10,000
right it's not just money to get the

574
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,278
money but really to get all other you

575
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,599
know I would say components that are

576
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:17,880
important for that yeah and have one big

577
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,959
Advantage this is long-term ter uh

578
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,080
partnership it's not only for one year

579
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,399
or two years but it could be for 15 20

580
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,759
years and if you are planning to do some

581
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:30,199
Innovation some research then you have

582
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,839
to run for a long long PA yeah I think

583
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,480
there's another example I mean there are

584
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,000
examples um in Slovenia there's many

585
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,200
examples internationally but there's if

586
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,038
we talk about Slovenia first there's an

587
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,600
example of

588
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:48,359
um uh automobil grost I think it's

589
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:51,079
called like uh Mobility yeah it's for

590
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:53,439
for mobility and for cluster exactly

591
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,519
cluster automobile cluster of automobile

592
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,640
manufacturers grost is cluster exactly

593
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:01,319
grost is like a grape or cluster

594
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,799
uh so that's that's an example uh which

595
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:05,720
has been around for quite a while and

596
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,319
and obviously Slovenia is one of the you

597
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,319
know major expor exporters automobile

598
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,960
parts to Major automobile manufacturers

599
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,319
that what's that work covich acrapovic

600
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,720
is one of the manufacturers here for

601
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,200
example that represents 20% of Slovenian

602
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,519
GDP

603
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,080
automobile stuff automobile stuff really

604
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:28,038
20% that's over 10

605
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,199
billion holy all the industry yeah

606
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:33,480
well um and then there are there are

607
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,038
very sophisticated uh examples that I

608
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,759
wanted to expand on I mean much more

609
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:39,359
inwi I would call them not just

610
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,960
Partnerships but really

611
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:45,558
ecosystems um such as the you know the

612
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,240
the the whole Boston area on on biotech

613
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:51,319
and the MIT connected directly to

614
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,919
companies um as well as obviously the

615
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:56,879
the federal government involved in that

616
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,960
I mean that that is you know that that

617
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,278
in itself is an example exle that a lot

618
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,960
of countries in Europe followed and

619
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,599
implemented to become certain hubs or

620
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,038
centers for development or research in

621
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,480
in certain areas but this is not you

622
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,960
know these are not funding projects

623
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,240
these are project I would call them

624
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,600
projects of ecosystems or ecosystems of

625
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,798
public private Partnerships well the

626
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,519
ecosystem that creates the

627
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:21,398
sustainability right or the

628
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,519
sustainability that is the E I mean it's

629
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:27,678
it's it's a it's connected correct yeah

630
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:30,359
so so you I mean I think the point is

631
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,440
the EOS system comprises of different uh

632
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,759
contributors that can be public or

633
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,278
private but actually uh aligned around

634
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:42,359
the common interest to to to usually

635
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,880
invest their time and resources in a

636
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,599
certain location that's that's so

637
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,679
ecosystem is usually bound to a certain

638
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:53,240
location um and and and I see that you

639
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,919
know private public this is how I see

640
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,440
private Public Partnerships or their

641
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,000
role importance I think it's much

642
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,278
greater than just a produ project level

643
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,880
but actually influencing and impacting

644
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:06,278
longlasting change in this environment

645
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
that's why we need connections between

646
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,278
the business and the industry because

647
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,599
the the uh the business sorry and the

648
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:14,839
the public sector the business is the

649
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:17,199
the the obviously the reality sector

650
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,439
that kind of contributes to the economy

651
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,759
however the public sector makes sure

652
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,480
that it it kind of protects interest of

653
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,679
the of the wider public and you need to

654
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,399
you need the collaboration between the

655
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,240
two right yeah I mean it makes it it not

656
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,639
as transient and ephemeral you know it

657
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,200
it makes it long lasting it's not just a

658
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,200
a quick fix it's not like you say do oh

659
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,120
we want to go for the money no yeah

660
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,480
we'll take the money but we have a

661
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,239

like an island uh so much exactly yeah

672
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:10,119
that's uh yeah I just add something I

673
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,640
mean uh I mean to me ecosystem means it

674

includes all factors for success of

675
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,840
certain business certain area but let me

676
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,720
take let me tell another joke you know I

677
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:22,639
was in maribor in one big event just

678
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,440
well just before the summer and there

679
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,240
were discussion you know about different

680
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,720
garment instruments you know how to uh

681
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,558
you know trigger more entrepreneurship

682
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,319
more Innovations Etc you know there was

683
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:37,519
one guy there who's running and he's

684
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:41,240
owing one of the very important

685
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,679
Slovenian companies you know and he said

686
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,960
okay I don't care what kind of

687
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,360
instrument will you come up with you

688
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,360
know I'll just take the

689
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,918
money well I mean I mean you if the

690
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,880
money's there who's not going to take it

691
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,120
so you can't blame the person to go get

692
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,679
the money you have to blame the system

693
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:03,918
yeah he's he's a big entrepreneur really

694
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,480
innovator you know so he was I think

695
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,960
maybe a little bit annoyed with the

696
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,798
discussion going on like he said okay

697
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,480
you just come up with an instrument I'll

698
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,759
take the money and I'll do the rest yeah

699
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,519
yeah too much talking not enough action

700
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:20,798
yeah uh that's funny um so what is goko

701
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,159
is there is there uh money for uh uh for

702
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,960
this type of thing in in the EU and is

703
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,640
there money in for Slovenia because I

704
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,120
know when you do when one would do a a

705
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,759
tender for example there's money from

706
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,439
Slovenia there's money from the EU

707
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,759
there's money from Slovenia that the EU

708
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,399
gave back and I like to say give back to

709
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:40,000
Slovenia

710
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,000
uh and then they get appropriated yeah

711
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,839
true very well put I mean I always

712
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,440
explain to people who are you know

713
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,480
somehow starting with this this sort of

714
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,120
funding you know there are two types of

715
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,839
EU funding one comes directly from

716
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,839
Brussels Brussel and the other one uh

717
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:59,000
comes indirectly or directly from the

718
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,959
Home Country so you have uh four funds

719
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,440
four different funds that um let's say

720
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,240
each Home Country National country is is

721
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,639
in charge of it it's cohesion which is

722
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,120
the most uh known I would say funding

723
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:15,798
then are Regional funds uh social funds

724
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,638
and also funds for agriculture and

725
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:21,960
Fisheries and Forestry so these four

726
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:24,759
funding of course cohesion um represents

727
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,038
the the largest part of it and I think

728
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:29,240
probably most of you heard that although

729
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,319
if you make a PO on the street asking

730
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,399
people what is cohesion I'm not sure

731
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:36,278
they would be able to answer but okay

732
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:38,278
it's quite huge money there and of

733
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,119
course there are some direct it's direct

734
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,480
funding from coming directly from from

735
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:46,119
Brussels as well there's additional

736
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,159
funding uh which came up after covid

737
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:52,678
which was connected to Next Generation

738
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:56,159
uh EU so that was additional funding uh

739
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,080
which um each country got so and there

740
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,440
were certain projects including there as

741
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,759
well in cooperation with European

742
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,880
commission which has to kind of approve

743
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:08,119
them U on General level so they're

744
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,639
mostly mostly digitalization green

745
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,759
economy and certain and similar stuff so

746
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,759
you know it's it's I call it I'm 10

747
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:19,839
years in in in Brussels now working

748
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:22,240
there and U sometimes still certain call

749
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,599
surprises me you know because I never

750
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,480
heard of that fund you know but I'm 10

751
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:28,119
years there so you know it's really a

752
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,480
jungle you know to be quite honest you

753
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:35,119
know so um myself and my team we do the

754
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,880
best to to naate to navigate through all

755
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,319
of this to know really how things work

756
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,880
out and we helped a lot of companies

757
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:43,879
mostly slovenians because we are

758
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,960
Slovenian Business Association but also

759
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,760
many International ones as well so we

760
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:52,278
basically worked for I would say um all

761
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,440
EU countries already and some non-eu

762
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:57,599
countries like we had some really

763
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,600
interesting cases from Western Balan Etc

764
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,558
so so you know it's it's jungle but you

765
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,599
can handle it if you have good people

766
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:07,519

there all

780
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,638
right about funding people usually come

781
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,119
to me after the my speech you know yeah

782
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:48,240
they don't want to ask questions

783
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:52,798
publicly

784
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:56,679
so well I I I'll take the

785
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:58,200
chance afterwards also if I may but uh

786
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:02,480
uh nevertheless we were speaking about

787
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:07,120
the funds tamana gich ecqa uh European

788
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,599
project leader uh certified that our uh

789
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,039
country and Europe and um you were

790
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,159
speaking about the funds and about the

791
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:18,800
cohesion funds which are not applicable

792
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:21,358
for the phys physical or uh private

793
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,599
company you know they have to they have

794
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:27,598
a different agenda so uh I meanwhile

795
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,679
when you were talking I was just typing

796
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,559
in in the procurement and public H uh

797
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:37,320
the European commission portal and

798
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:39,639
regarding hemp there is no one so uh

799
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,280
since the the mechanism of European

800
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:47,599
commission is that if there is need uh

801
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:52,040
sooner or later uh a a fund or a call

802
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,919
has to be defined and it is uh it it is

803
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:58,400
uh coordinated and designed from

804
00:34:54,918 --> 00:35:02,199
different parts from different uh uh

805
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,480
European uh members uh I suggest that if

806
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:08,439
you are if you intend to to do your

807
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:14,358
public uh uh what what did you call it

808
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:18,000
uh diversity no uh diversion uh um uh uh

809
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:21,279
event on May the 15th next year I

810
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,800
suggest that you invite people from as

811
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,480
many countries as possible because the

812
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:33,119
need to to design to to have such a call

813
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:36,639
has to come uh alive and then the

814
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,640
European commission can uh can

815
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:43,440
respond uh otherwise it won't I've also

816
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:45,799
been to the Horizon uh uh medical uh uh

817
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,318
course and public procurement and if you

818
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,519
don't have two millions in uh uh of of

819
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:55,559
Leverage uh and you know that means

820
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:58,440
active money on your account uh they are

821
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:02,559
not interested and uh

822
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,400
since the the hemp issue uh relates to

823
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:11,159
the supporting activities of either

824
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,838
industry research or medical research um

825
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,199
it is almost impossible to come through

826
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,559
so this is why we have the problem in in

827
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,559
in lublana we have or in Slovenia we

828
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,599
have great institutes we have people who

829
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,838
re who do the research but since they

830
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:28,559
are not able to come to uh to to the

831
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:31,239
relevant data either in Slovenia or in

832
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:35,039
Europe and see they don't have uh a

833
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:37,719
person uh to speak to or the uh referee

834
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,440
in European commission it's uh almost

835
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:42,639
Miss mission impossible so what's your

836
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:47,800
question is it how do how how do you

837
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:50,838
intend to uh make aware uh that the uh

838
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,079
you know how to how do uh how would you

839
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:58,039
like how do you intend to to address

840
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,920
European commission with your event with

841
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,719
active May yeah yes please okay thank

842
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,119
you for your discussion and your opinion

843
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,000
but actually I mean if you listened

844
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,960
carefully I said that there is no call

845
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,318
for for this industry right now uh but I

846
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,159
said that on the other way on the other

847
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:19,480
hand there are calls which are just for

848
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,960
Innovation so so so theoretically you

849
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:25,000
could go there because it's not call for

850
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,119
any particular subject is just call for

851
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,119
Innovation Innovative product which

852
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,079
could be whatever Innovative product so

853
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,599
theoretically it could be Innovative

854
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,920
product including cannabis regarding

855
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,440
industri green economy Health uh

856
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,960
whatever theoretically in a small

857
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,240
country and I'm talking about European

858
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Innovation Council which goes for this

859
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:47,118
uh stuff sort of that there are six

860
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
different instruments there I I mean I

861
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,480
can go in detail if you want but I I

862
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,639
don't think anyone want to we're running

863
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,519
out of time but you know that's that's

864
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,799
one point and that's why we are making

865
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,519
this uh that's the idea of this U

866
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,400
conference in Brussels it will be more I

867
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:05,159
would say uh regulation and policy

868
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:08,720
oriented to make aware commission uh

869
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:10,920
about this industry about this potential

870
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,559
and as I said at very first beginning I

871
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,639
think we should improve research in

872
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,519
cannabis in order with this scientific

873
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:20,480
research the scientific results and

874
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,679
research persuade those who still don't

875
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,480
believe there's potential here and

876
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,960
through this the calls are far away from

877
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,719
I mean specific calls for this area

878
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,240
they're far there you know but we have

879
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:34,759
to start with the persuasion and with

880
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:38,118
the research scientifically proved

881
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,839
results of some issues yes and that's it

882
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,920
technical Readiness level for each core

883
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:46,199
of innovation is at least three or four

884
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,200
this is impossible to to to to develop

885
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,838
in Slovenia especially if you are a

886
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:52,199
small country well first I'll say

887
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,279
nothing's impossible and I don't really

888
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:56,000
like I don't love to hear all that talk

889
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,800
you can have a problem and you can say

890
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,800
it's improbable but don't ever say it's

891
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,160
impossible but you can have you know

892
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,160
again you can have international

893
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,759
Partners Etc you don't mention just

894
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,279
Slovenia we International Community here

895
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,079
and most of the calls actually ask that

896
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,720
you have some International or

897
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,000
crossborder Partners so don't say just

898
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:18,598
Slovenia or we cannot do it or something

899
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,880
like that I quite agree all right we're

900
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,000
good let's hear it again for all the

901
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,640
panelists very Lively discussion toward

902
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,440
the end and I'm sure they'd love to talk

903
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:30,440
to you uh more about it out outside
