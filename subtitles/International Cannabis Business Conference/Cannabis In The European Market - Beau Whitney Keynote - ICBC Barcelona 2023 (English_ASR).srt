10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:38,640
the chief Economist of Whitney economics

11
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,640
let's hear it for Beau Whitney

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,760
foreign

13
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,859
hey it's a pleasure to be here today

14
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,079
um thanks for everybody for traveling

15
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,200
coming a long way

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,239
um so I'm an economist and in the

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,039
Cannabis space and there's not too many

18
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,538
of us around

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,359
um in fact I was

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,439
at the grocery store the other day and I

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,780
had this

22
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,259
sweatshirt on with a cartoon character

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,579
called Scooby-Doo on it and the caption

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:16,260
said Dooby Dooby Doo and if this van

25
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:18,840
smoke and we be token right and uh the

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,080
the person at the checkout counter said

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,659
hey that's a pretty cool sweatshirt

28
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,359
and uh she said uh you know where'd you

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,460
get it and all this and eventually it

30
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,140
came around to that I was an economist

31
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,539
in the Cannabis space

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,219
she goes what is that

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,259
and I said well you know I look at the

34
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,078
numbers I track the market and the

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,879
trends and stuff and and she said oh

36
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,158
that's very interesting and so I paid

37
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,219
for my groceries and as I was leaving

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,340
she said hey good luck with that made-up

39
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,399
job of yours

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,478
[Laughter]

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,960
what anyway so yeah there's uh I'm an

42
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,539
economist I'm not making this up

43
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,399
so today I'm going to talk about the

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,320
European market I'm going to give a kind

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,759
of a global and a U.S update because

46
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,739
everybody wants to talk about the U.S

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,860
numbers and then I'll

48
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:14,039
um look at this in terms of the EU

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,959
Market give a little bit of data on spin

50
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,079
and then compare and contrast a little

51
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,939
bit of the policy going on between the

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,819
U.S and and the EU

53
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:26,699
so Whitney economics is a consulting

54
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:30,000
firm we do economic Consulting we

55
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:32,159
provide data to the industry we have a

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,259
forecast a total addressable forecast

57
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,659
for every country in the world where

58
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,120
clientele on practically every continent

59
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,639
so you know I've been in the industry

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,840
now for about nine years and so if you

61
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,839
need any data just let me know

62
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,879
um and so like I said we're just going

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,640
to do a little compare and contrast

64
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,639
after I give you some data

65
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,399
um now just a level set cannabis is

66
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,500
really three Industries in one it's it's

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,700
the adult use it's medical and it's

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,419
Industrial

69
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:06,979
and Industrial is then also broken down

70
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:10,318
into three markets the fiber and Grain

71
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:13,259
and then the cannabinoid Market

72
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,060
and I think it's important to note this

73
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,060
because people don't understand I think

74
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,699
hemp they think CBD or minor

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,680
cannabinoids or whatever

76
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,719
but it's important to educate people on

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,540
this and and differentiate between the

78
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,818
two more or the three markets but a lot

79
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,318
of countries are reforming right now and

80
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:32,939
they're looking at it from an economic

81
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,000
development perspective from a jobs

82
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:38,280
perspective and the like

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,219
um and you know based upon our numbers

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,019
it's a combined it's over a trillion

85
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,979
dollars and if you think about that

86
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,480
trillion dollars you know the U.S market

87
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:51,840
total addressable is about a hundred

88
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,119
billion if you add in hemp you add in

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,219
the medical Market the European market

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,980
the Asian market a trillion dollars and

91
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,080
and so people really have difficulty

92
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,000
putting their arms around that a

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,239
trillion dollars

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,060
um but what's going on is that a lot of

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,920
these these countries want to embrace

96
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,080
cannabis but they're kind kind of

97
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,560
waiting for the U.S to set the trend

98
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,160
give them the okay and then then they'll

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,978
follow suit now what I think is could

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,560
end up happening though is that as the

101
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,959
EU starts deploying legal cannabis

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,300
especially on the adult youth side like

103
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,659
in Germany in the Czech Republic and

104
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,240
elsewhere then the European market could

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,340
flip this around and actually become the

106
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,019
Big Driver in cannabis reform around the

107
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,138
world

108
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,180
so there's over 30 or sorry 70 countries

109
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,300
around the world that have some form of

110
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,060
legal access to cannabis and there's

111
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,600
massive numbers

112
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,819
350 to 500 million consumers

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,840
and these are conservative numbers

114
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,478
because a lot of the you know

115
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,339
researchers

116
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,978
look at surveys and they deploy these

117
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,539
surveys and the surveys go like this hi

118
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm from the government do you smoke

119
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,100
weed and in states and countries where

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,439
there's prohibition then the responses

121
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,259
are uh no I don't know what you're

122
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,160
talking about even if they are consumers

123
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:28,560
and so a lot of the numbers are actually

124
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,360
lower than the reality of the situation

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,939
but

126
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,819
with the total Market of 350 billion

127
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:38,100
dollars for medical and adult use total

128
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,918
addressable Market illicit and legal

129
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,600
combined combined with hemp that's that

130
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,399
gets you to a trillion dollars really

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,460
quickly

132
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,079
um and like I mentioned countries are

133
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,698
looking at this for economic development

134
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,099
they're looking at it for jobs they're

135
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,439
looking at it to reduce Health Care

136
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,960
expenditures

137
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,279
to reallocate law enforcement and the

138
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,579
like so there's a real compelling

139
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,939
argument for legal cannabis

140
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:09,240
so in terms of the U.S

141
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,100
um little-known fact 10 states out of

142
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,579
the 38 that have legal cannabis actually

143
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,280
saw sales declines last year

144
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:19,099
growth was really low it was anemic at

145
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,038
4.5 percent

146
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:26,759
and a lot of the industry thought that

147
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:30,300
this The Surge that came from covid and

148
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,038
increased the demand over 2020 21 22

149
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,579
that that was going to continue

150
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:38,639
indefinitely but as people came back to

151
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,800
the market and are back to work and back

152
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,019
to school then they didn't have as much

153
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,439
of an opportunity to consume cannabis

154
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,659
and so sales dropped so that really

155
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,538
suppressed demand in the first half of

156
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,600
last year on a global basis

157
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,699
and then in the U.S in particular

158
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,520
um inflation started taking a bite out

159
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,160
of people's paycheck and the consumers

160
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,418
were resistant at first they they spent

161
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,600
about the same

162
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:09,418
if they had a discount on flour for

163
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,400
example they would backfill with Edibles

164
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,740
or pre-roll what have you and they'd

165
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,318
spend about the same but as the year

166
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,418
wore on inflation started taking a

167
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,180
greater bite out of their

168
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:24,598
um you know income and so they started

169
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,780
spending less and so pre-covet or

170
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:30,478
post-covid decline combined with changes

171
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:33,719
in consumer Behavior it really had a

172
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,300
devastating effect on the market overall

173
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,060
and it kind of spooked investors it

174
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,680
spooked operators a lot of people

175
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,740
operators did more with less they didn't

176
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,319
hire as many people they didn't deploy

177
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,439
some of their

178
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,539
operations on schedule they deferred and

179
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,639
delayed and like

180
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:57,899
um and so

181
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,538
um so this really hurt profitability in

182
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:04,198
the United States and so we deployed a

183
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:06,000
survey in Q4 of last year only 24

184
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,160
percent of the respondents were actually

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,918
making a profit and so if you think

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,740
about that that means 76 of The

187
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,680
Operators were either breaking even or

188
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,079
losing money and so this is you know

189
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,300
kind of alarming when you're an investor

190
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,439
or when you're an operator and nobody's

191
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,918
making money

192
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:29,098
and and demand is going down so the

193
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,680
industry really struggled in 2022 I'm

194
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:36,778
not forecasting that it does much into

195
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,700
to improve until 2024 2025 in the U.S

196
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,360
um and there's some inhibiting factors

197
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:45,300
there's policy issues like safe banking

198
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,959
which gives access to finance gives some

199
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:50,159
protections on bankruptcy and the like

200
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,319
taxes are very heavy in the United

201
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,299
States and so this is suppressing the

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,060
growth in the profitability of the

203
00:08:54,299 --> 00:09:01,379
industry interstate commerce would open

204
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:04,619
up a lot of opportunities for producer

205
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:07,559
States for Consumer States would level

206
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,919
level profits I mean excuse me level

207
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,319
prices out and make it uniform across

208
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,179
the country to a certain extent and so

209
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,240
there's a lot of policy issues Brewing

210
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,979
but there's not much in terms of

211
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,440
forecasting that this is going to be

212
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,519
resolved over the next Years it'll

213
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,500
probably

214
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,720
either push out into 2024 or Beyond

215
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,820
there will be a presidential election

216
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,580
and then even after that even after the

217
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,379
reform occurs then

218
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,920
um it'll take a while for these policies

219
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:42,480
to be implemented on at a national level

220
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,819
there is a comment in one of the

221
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,220
previous panels about

222
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,540
um you know

223
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,240
protectionist policies and access to

224
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:54,299
markets that's really interesting

225
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,120
comment it really resonated with me in

226
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:59,338
some of the federal legalization bills

227
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,459
that are being bantered about in

228
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,980
Washington DC a lot of this opens up the

229
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,439
U.S market to foreign competition almost

230
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,240
immediately and this could have a

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
devastating effect on the market on

232
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,360
operators in the U.S because they have a

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,940
kind of a higher cost of production and

234
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,459
you know other International competitors

235
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,100
could come in at a lower cost and now

236
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,599
compete with a pretty substantial Market

237
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,580
already

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
um over 40 000 licensees in the United

239
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,420
States

240
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,159
and so there's a lot going on like I

241
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,799
mentioned people are waiting countries

242
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:38,639
are waiting for the U.S to reform even

243
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,579
Mexico when constitutionally it's legal

244
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,159
but they haven't deployed their rules

245
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,959
and regulations yet

246
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:48,719
and don't look for them to deploy

247
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:52,259
anytime soon until the U.S gives some

248
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,139
type of indication about what's going on

249
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:58,139
so I've got a forecast here I just

250
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,120
refreshed this we track data from every

251
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,899
state

252
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,879
and some of the ramps and the deployment

253
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,339
of the regulatory systems in some of

254
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,439
these key states are lagging right now

255
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,140
and so I've had to take down my

256
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,120
forecasts and near term

257
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:19,139
um but look even though there was only

258
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,179
4.5 growth in sales last year there's

259
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,078
still going to be about 12 growth this

260
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,879
year but that's far below what was

261
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,319
forecasted even six months nine months

262
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,360
ago

263
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,079
um and like I mentioned you know we saw

264
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,720
negative growth in in 10 states

265
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:40,620
um and the new growth is predicted to be

266
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,899
in the bigger States like New York New

267
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,700
Jersey but they're really struggling

268
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,399
right now with the deployment of their

269
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,620
legal programs

270
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,740
um and a lot of the product categories

271
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,560
like flour Edibles tinctures and like

272
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,379
are actually facing deflation so a lot

273
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:01,500
of the conversation globally and in the

274
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:04,320
United States is talking about inflation

275
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,480
um hurting consumers uh it's just the

276
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,140
opposite for cannabis operators they're

277
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,200
seeing deflation uh lower prices and

278
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:16,278
lower profitability so this is a an

279
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,560
issue to really you know keep an eye on

280
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,958
as you look at the markets either the US

281
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,379
market or European market and then

282
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,239
inflation is starting to impact startups

283
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,299
and so if you think about it interest

284
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,600
rates are rising the cost of your loans

285
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:38,219
is increasing and so it's taking a bite

286
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,920
out of your budget and you have to kind

287
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,720
of earn more generate more Revenue in

288
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,899
order to cover those increased costs of

289
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,759
your capital and so startups are not

290
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,039
getting out of the game it quick enough

291
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,819
and this is also suppressing the growth

292
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:57,599
of the overall Market

293
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:01,320
in terms of European market it's about a

294
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,040
70 billion dollar market for 62 to 70.

295
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,620
if you add in

296
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:10,919
some of the other European nations

297
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,759
include Russia it could be as much as

298
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:17,879
260 billion dollars

299
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:21,179
and it's by Revenue it's maybe the

300
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,919
second largest market in the globe but

301
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,578
from a consumer perspective it's like

302
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,379
the fourth or fifth Asia and Africa have

303
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:31,019
more consumers but they just spend less

304
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,899
because they don't have as much money

305
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,899
um in European as you all know is

306
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:40,919
looking at reforms I put Spain here as

307
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:43,980
as a courtesy but not a whole lot of

308
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,659
Reform going on in Spain right now but I

309
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,519
think where things are really the action

310
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,679
that's really happening is in Germany in

311
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,139
the Czech Republic

312
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,239
um and so if you get legalization and

313
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,419
adult use rolled out successfully there

314
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,100
it could have this domino effect

315
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:01,979
throughout the West the rest of the

316
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,079
European market and then that could in

317
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,940
turn influence

318
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,319
um the rest of the globe

319
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,360
and

320
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,000
even though there's consumer markets in

321
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,659
Germany and Czech Republic and Italy

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,700
even some of the periphery countries are

323
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,860
looking to be the producers and the

324
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,500
suppliers into the central European

325
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,720
market so there's opportunities in the

326
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,278
periphery countries just as much as

327
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,839
there's opportunities in in Central and

328
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,759
you know you're starting to see this

329
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,060
through the medical programs and the

330
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,519
medical supply chains

331
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:42,899
um there's very little data on this so

332
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,480
as key stakeholders in this space any

333
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,339
chance that you can collect data and

334
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,199
share data amongst yourselves the better

335
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,480
off you're going to be you'll just make

336
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,078
better decisions more informed decisions

337
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,480
and and you'll demystify what's going on

338
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,578
in the space we collect data all the

339
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,139
time but it's just hard to come by

340
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,138
especially at the consumer level

341
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,860
so there's five key countries that from

342
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:13,940
a total Market that solicit plus legal

343
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:16,440
that make up the EU

344
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,800
a majority of it comes from just five

345
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,660
countries and so Italy is some people

346
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,539
say well what about Germany shouldn't

347
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:27,360
that be at the top but from these um

348
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,759
surveys there's more consumers of

349
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,759
cannabis that will admit to governmental

350
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,379
survey takers that they consume in Italy

351
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,139
more so than they do in Germany and that

352
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,659
kind of makes sense culturally

353
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,459
um and so there could be as many as 150

354
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,620
million consumers

355
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,899
um in the European market and so that's

356
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,078
a pretty substantial Market if you think

357
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:52,578
about it it could combine even be larger

358
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,578
than the North American Market

359
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,220
um in terms of supply

360
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,339
so I took a look we have a total Market

361
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,740
forecast for Spain I looked at it from a

362
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:08,040
consumer perspective about 3.5 million

363
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:12,240
consumers so it's a big Market here and

364
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:14,879
that requires about 880 000 kilos of

365
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,039
cultivated output that's not just flour

366
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,860
but that's you know cultivated output

367
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,519
required for tinctures and oils bombs

368
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,320
and the like but if you think about it

369
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,100
there's only 24

370
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,660
000

371
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:33,300
uh kilos authorized in 2023 that's an

372
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:35,698
ICBC stat that they just published out

373
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,879
that's a that's a real good number for

374
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:41,399
perspective it was 6 000 kilos just a

375
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,980
couple of years ago so the Spanish

376
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,259
Market is very very underserved with

377
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,839
their current infrastructure and so

378
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,579
there needs to be if it's going to go

379
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,740
adult use or if there's going to be an

380
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,500
expansion of the medical program then

381
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,720
there's going to be a need for increased

382
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,778
cultivated output and this is a common

383
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,060
mistake that countries have when they

384
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:06,539
deploy legal cannabis is they tend to

385
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:08,519
focus initially on the retail side and

386
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,039
then they go backwards but they don't

387
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,798
realize that cultivation is the longest

388
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,558
lead time item and so really they should

389
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,480
understand their supply before they

390
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,459
start trying to sell it and process and

391
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,519
the like

392
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,100
um and so Spain 880

393
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:29,339
000 kilos

394
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:30,418
now as things mature

395
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,480
um you know there's going to be

396
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:36,600
increased competition from Africa

397
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,079
um from other European markets but

398
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:42,719
um Spain is positioned to such an extent

399
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,839
similar to Malta to where they could be

400
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,240
a conduit from Africa and into the

401
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,659
European Union especially on the medical

402
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,660
side

403
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,000
and so I wanted to talk a little bit

404
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,600
about industrial cannabis

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,019
so I looked at 10 product categories and

406
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,599
looked at the total market and then what

407
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,339
could be peeled off and supported just

408
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,538
very conservatively by industrial

409
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,298
cannabis

410
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:15,119
and when you look at automobile parts

411
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:17,460
and alternative Plastics

412
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:21,119
and foods for animals and human

413
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,919
consumption the and lithium battery

414
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,500
Replacements you can actually do

415
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,900
batteries using

416
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,779
fibers from hemp

417
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,440
plastic Cutlery in bags

418
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,460
at the market for hemp is actually

419
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,980
larger and the opportunity is actually

420
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,679
larger than the adult use in medical

421
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,960
combined and so that's kind of stunning

422
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,240
that's why I started off by saying that

423
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,279
it's three markets and then three

424
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,740
markets within three markets because

425
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,079
people don't realize that the real

426
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,919
potential of industrial cannabis

427
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,240
especially in in the United States

428
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,460
but they're they're starting to realize

429
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,339
it and embrace it more so in in the

430
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,840
European markets

431
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,418
um and then there's also some

432
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,178
environmental and climate related issues

433
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:12,020
that could be addressed with industrial

434
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,019
cannabis as well

435
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:18,240
so there's some differences in the

436
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:22,200
market and it's pretty interesting to

437
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,480
think about uh in the U.S they say hemp

438
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,058
is legal

439
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,279
cannabis on the adult use of medical

440
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:32,279
side is federally illegal

441
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,079
and it creates this Havoc from

442
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,440
Regulators they just don't know how to

443
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,659
handle that legal versus illegal and so

444
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,480
they really muck it up on both sides of

445
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,179
that fence of the THC fence that

446
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,419
delineates what is legal and what is not

447
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,820
and so they're adopting these policies

448
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:53,460
at the state level

449
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:55,079
um which just aren't very effective and

450
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,240
they're actually hurting the growth of

451
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,460
both markets and then there's some

452
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,279
infighting in the United States between

453
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,779
the adult use and medical side and the

454
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,759
industrial side because there's some

455
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:08,240
competing

456
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,140
um you know Supply

457
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,880
especially on the intoxicating

458
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,940
cannabinoid side

459
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,400
and so you've got this competition this

460
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,220
fragmentation and you just don't see

461
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,000
that as much in Europe what the you know

462
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:27,419
the differences are here and my firm is

463
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,179
studying all 27 countries here and we're

464
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:33,538
doing country reports due out later on

465
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,400
the summer for every every country

466
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:36,660
and so we're looking at a dog as we're

467
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,340
looking at Medical we're looking at

468
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,038
industrial opportunities and the rules

469
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:43,740
and regulations and Europe treats this

470
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,779
much differently they're they considered

471
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,880
all cannabis and then they try to figure

472
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,038
out how to regulate it from an

473
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,000
industrial perspective from adult use

474
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:56,119
perspective and the like uh the one area

475
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,440
of kind of

476
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,739
commonality is how to address

477
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,660
cannabinoids that are derived from hemp

478
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:08,940
you're seeing some products come in from

479
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:10,380
the U.S on the cannabinoid side but not

480
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,798
a whole lot right now even though

481
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,919
there's this real intense demand

482
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:20,879
um so if if you think about it if

483
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,220
if there's this well on CBD there's this

484
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,880
policy that says if it's legal in one

485
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,980
country in the EU then it's mostly legal

486
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,620
for distribution and sales in all the

487
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,440
countries and so if you apply that apply

488
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:37,319
that to adult use and medical then there

489
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,038
could be this rapid changeover in

490
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:43,918
deployment of adult use products

491
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:45,119
post-german and Czech launches into the

492
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,179
other countries

493
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,379
and if that happens then you've got a

494
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,880
quick turn

495
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,880
on your

496
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,240
Market opportunities here and it's going

497
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,620
to drive policy back into North America

498
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
and it's a little bit of a counter

499
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:04,139
narrative but I think that there's a

500
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,200
real possibility because the U.S is just

501
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,120
dragging its feet it's still dealing

502
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,179
with banking

503
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,879
interstate commerce and all that and the

504
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,320
EU has that already wrapped up and so

505
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,820
they don't have to deal with that so

506
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,480
those are some of the

507
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:24,839
key differences in between the U.S

508
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,360
market and the European market

509
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,899
so if I were to break out my crystal

510
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:33,798
ball and that's what economists do

511
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:37,140
then I think as Germany

512
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:39,240
sets the tone it'll set the tone for the

513
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,580
rest of Europe a lot of even the

514
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,900
industrial cannabis countries are

515
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:47,158
looking to Germany for guidance on this

516
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,038
and there's going to be an acceleration

517
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,179
of the market there is mentioned earlier

518
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:56,940
about

519
00:22:51,179 --> 00:23:00,559
Gap and EU GMP I think certified seeds

520
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,419
and stable genetics are going to also be

521
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,819
an opportunity here and and those will

522
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,179
set the standards and it'll really be

523
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:11,639
more on the medical side things will be

524
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:16,740
kind of centered around the public

525
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:22,679
safety focus and more Medical in nature

526
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:24,359
rather than social or adult use nature

527
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,940
um and then you know things will just

528
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,859
kind of normalize once things get

529
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,440
deployed so

530
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:34,740
um and then hemp will come on strong as

531
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,900
well so lots of exciting opportunities

532
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,819
in the European market

533
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,400
um and so

534
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:45,000
in terms of recommendations

535
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,298
um you know go to Gatherings like this

536
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,460
start your network now before the

537
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:52,980
markets change and change rapidly

538
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,679
develop your supply chains and your

539
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,538
contacts within the supply chain so that

540
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,880
you can establish these relationships

541
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:03,720
and then expand on them and leverage

542
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,419
them to increase your revenues your

543
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,700
profits your capabilities

544
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,620
um but be very very conscientious of

545
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,019
your cost structure and don't get too

546
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,759
far out of your skis over your skis

547
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:16,980
because

548
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,679
um you know costs will come down prices

549
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,319
will come down as the market normalizes

550
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,840
it's very competitive here because

551
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,579
everybody wants to supply into the EU

552
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,859
right now because it's the only place to

553
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:30,859
supply medical so you've got South

554
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,058
Americans you've got Asians you've got

555
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,699
Australians North Americans they're all

556
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:38,460
trying to provide for this very same

557
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:42,419
Market that the EU to players are also

558
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:45,480
trying to supply in so being disciplined

559
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,600
about your internal cost is really

560
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,940
really critically important

561
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:55,019
and use data if you need data I know

562
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,659
where to go and and really you know act

563
00:24:55,019 --> 00:25:00,779
local because cannabis is a localized

564
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,700
issue but then think Global because it's

565
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:06,000
really a global Marketplace

566
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,798
so that's what I have for you today I

567
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,900
wanted to if we have some time for

568
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:13,460
questions oh

569
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,460
darn we don't have time

570
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,460
one more time there you go uh we don't

571
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,918
have time for questions but I'm sure if

572
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,659
you want to accost him in the hallway he

573
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,538
would love to talk to you one more time

574
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:32,960
