delighted to be here

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,599
also delighted to see that no one is

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,919
that hungover

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,679
that's awesome usually on day two you

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,000
know you see a lot of sunglasses and

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:23,118
large coffees so thank you for being

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,359
here on day two at the icbc

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,879
could not be more delighted

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
myself and new frontier data have

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,358
actually participated in this conference

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,558
quite a few times and

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,920
the fact that they're bringing it to

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,839
europe with the caliber and

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,800
sophistication that they have it's

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,780
wonderful so i applaud alex and his team

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:45,839
you did a great job

18
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:48,079
[Applause]

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
yesterday we heard so many wonderful

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480
speakers and they really covered such a

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,878
wide array of information

22
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,959
i particularly liked when peter from

23
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,119
denton mentioned that the difference

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,280
between an american and a german kicking

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,599
off a presentation

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,560
is that americans start with a joke

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
and germans start with an agenda

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,719
well

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760
i'm not that funny and we're in germany

30
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,239
so i'm going to start with a little

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
agenda

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,079
today what i really would like to

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
accomplish is three things one i'd like

34
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,158
to tell you a little bit about myself

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,159
and my journey because

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,359
seven years ago almost

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,719
to the date

38
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,438
um i was

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,640
you entering a brand new industry i want

40
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,478
to tell you a little bit about the

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,200
company that i founded

42
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,280
and

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
highlight maybe how it could help you

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,840
navigate this industry where data and

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,000
information and transparency is still

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439
very much required

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,519
and then i want to give you a little bit

48
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,199
of a overview of what's happening around

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,319
the globe in the cannabis industry

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,320
because today it is a global phenomena

51
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,239
we have over 70 nations around the world

52
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,559
that have legalized and while you may

53
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,158
think that you only have to be concerned

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,040
what happens in your background in your

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,799
backyard the truth of the matter is that

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
it's all interconnected and it's an

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,959
industry that's grown so fast

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,520
that what happens next door really does

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,439
impact what you're doing here

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,159
last but not least

61
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,959
i want to talk about money because well

62
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,840
yes

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,159
we

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,598
we absolutely are in an industry that

65
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,719
where we have an opportunity and a

66
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,159
responsibility to do good

67
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,598
at the end of the day as business people

68
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,639
we also have an opportunity and

69
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,280
responsibility to make money

70
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,759
so let me jump right in

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,759
i'm jada de carcer

72
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,318
founder and executive chair new frontier

73
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,518
data and as i mentioned almost a decade

74
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,079
ago

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,680
unbeknownst to me i stumbled into what

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
we referred to at the time the pot

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,319
industry

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,439
when i first announced to my colleagues

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,039
and my family that i was going into the

80
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,400
cannabis industry and i made sure to

81
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,239
call it the cannabis industry i

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
immediately got tagged as

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
hmm here's a half italian half cuban

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,760
woman that's going into the drug

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,120
business we should probably stay away

86
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,519
that has changed tremendously

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
especially when you look right now at

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,879
this room i remember the first time

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,280
november of 2014. i attended my first

90
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,878
conference sitting like you are to

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
understand sort of who was who and what

92
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,000
was what in this new space he was in

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
california

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,239
and i was you know wearing my suit ready

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,920
you know i'm starting a business you

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,200
know i've had my hair up kind of like

97
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:39,518
now my glasses my heels i enter the room

98
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,518
and there's literally a cloud of smoke

99
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,239
i go on stage to pitch my great idea

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,480
about data and analytics and literally

101
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,519
someone from the room said

102
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,959
can we smoke it

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
if we can't

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,878
we don't care

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,319
well we care now and we care about data

106
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,239
today in fact i was very pleased

107
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,479
yesterday how much we discussed the

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,719
value and the power of information and

109
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,840
data for this industry

110
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,759
and

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,400
when you look around the room today you

112
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:14,239
can see how much we have evolved and how

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,478
fast this industry has evolved

114
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,759
so a little bit then about new frontier

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,918
data

116
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
the mission

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,439
the vision

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,439
has always been to elevate the

119
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,519
discussion around this

120
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,519
industry that has medical recreational

121
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,680
and industrial implications through

122
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,918
fact-based reporting

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,000
there continues to be massive amounts of

124
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,719
misinformation in general but

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,639
specifically about this industry why

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,479
because it is extremely challenging to

127
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,879
collect good data

128
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,599
pertinent to the industry because it is

129
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,079
fragmented because it is new

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,360
because it was born of a movement

131
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,439
because it is still mainly illegal

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,639
so what we are trying to do

133
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,279
is to apply very rigorous process in not

134
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,960
only the data collection

135
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:08,000
but the data analysis and the reporting

136
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,159
fact-based reporting what a crazy idea

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,800
that's what we do and we're very excited

138
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,919
to say that in the past decade we have

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,879
been able

140
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,120
to

141
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,120
position ourselves as a trusted source

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,439
of information if we don't have an

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
answer we'll tell you we don't have it

144
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,079
but we have predicted market shifts

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,918
throughout the globe at this point in

146
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,560
over 100 nations pretty accurately

147
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,319
and as such we have also earned about 17

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,319
billion in earned media that is how many

149
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,399
eyeballs repeatedly look at our

150
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,800
information on a weekly and monthly

151
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,198
basis

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,199
enough about new frontier data

153
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,720
but i'm always here if i can help so

154
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,079
feel free to reach out to me but let's

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,520
talk a little bit about this massive

156
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,599
opportunity on a global scale

157
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,799
today

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,240
the global cannabis market

159
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
spending has reached over 400 billion

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,639
415 billion to be exact

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
look at what other industries are next

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
to it

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,080
what's very interesting is that for

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,720
instance tobacco fast food and beer are

165
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,680
all industries that are also looking

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
into

167
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
the cannabis consumer and cannabis

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
products

169
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,679
that means that it truly has become an

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,000
industry where everyone

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,720
is interested and they could touch some

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,038
massive massive mainstream mature

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,919
sectors very very soon and in fact it's

174
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,959
happening as we speak

175
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,120
a global marketplace

176
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,318
what you see there is

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,399
what occurred very very recently so last

178
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
year as i'm sure many of you know the

179
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,000
world health the world health

180
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
organization and the un declassified

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
cannabis

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
and these are the nations that

183
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,160
voted

184
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,598
yes

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,759
and no

186
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,680
why is this important

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,840
because we all want to know where the

188
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,319
next opportunity lies we all want to

189
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,318
know what is the next nation to legalize

190
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,598
whether because of opportunities or

191
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,000
challenges

192
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,240
and as you can see especially when we

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,160
look at europe

194
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
we have just scratched the surface

195
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,160
what's been really interesting having

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
what i think is a front row seat that

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,919
has been happening in this industry not

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,918
only north america but now europe

199
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,839
but in also africa and latin america is

200
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,439
we're beginning to see

201
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,279
the emergence of

202
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,759
regional centers of excellence is how i

203
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,318
like to call it what does that mean

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,720
so and let me take a step back

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,360
between 2014 and 2017 in the united

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,120
states we went from a handful of legal

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
states to

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,280
half of the united states and in twice

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
that time we're currently at a point

210
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,478
where it's over 35 states that have

211
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,038
legalized and now we're beginning to

212
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,680
discuss federal legalization

213
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:59,360
well in half that time

214
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,240
over 79 nations today have legalized

215
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,400
cannabis it's happened so fast that

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,960
we're beginning to see it's not only

217
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,159
positioning and competition from a

218
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,159
company to company perspective or even a

219
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,960
nation to a nation perspective we're

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:19,120
beginning to see positioning on a

221
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,878
regional basis so let me elaborate

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
cultivation so

223
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,560
we're all looking for that optimal

224
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,519
cultivation climate

225
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,280
or conditions well latin america and

226
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,319
africa do provide optimal climates

227
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,120
also

228
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,278
low labor costs so what is occurring

229
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,679
well nations within latin america and

230
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,439
africa are trying to position themselves

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,719
as the center of excellence when it

232
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,959
comes to cultivation and exports

233
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,879
consumption well we all know that today

234
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,919
the epicenter of consumption continues

235
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,799
to be the u.s north america

236
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,039
well

237
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,838
so is europe in fact i like to call

238
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,599
europe the next frontier

239
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
european nations are beginning to

240
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
legalize but also and i will talk about

241
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,080
this a little more when you look at the

242
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,640
gap between number of people and amount

243
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,639
of consumption per person you see that

244
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,480
the market in europe is very important

245
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,399
also north america and europe are

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,639
positioning as centers of excellence

247
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,919
when it comes to innovation so in north

248
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,240
america we've seen a lot of new

249
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,399
technologies that have risen

250
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,720
in terms of ag tech agriculture

251
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,639
technology in europe what we're seeing

252
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
is some very advanced technologies

253
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,480
pertinent to extraction and processing

254
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,159
in fact i wouldn't be surprised if many

255
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
of you in the room today are in the

256
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,759
business of extraction and processing

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,278
and last but not least asia and oceania

258
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,799
so for those of you who haven't followed

259
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,559
some of the medical research while

260
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,199
australia and new zealand and other

261
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,359
nations around asia pacific have

262
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,600
definitely sort of planted their flag in

263
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,839
terms of trying to advance the research

264
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,240
and the science behind the plant and

265
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,959
they continue as well as israel and they

266
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,360
continue to try to reach out to other

267
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,679
nations to bring in that that sour

268
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,839
affair uh and and advance the

269
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,838
conversation around medical research

270
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,879
some trading highlights

271
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
so the discussion around import and

272
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,439
exports is a little premature why well

273
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,278
because the regulation around each

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
nation and region is still a little

275
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,799
nascent nonetheless as we all know we

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
have begun to see

277
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,199
import and export specifically in europe

278
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,240
from latin america

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
these are the nations that currently are

280
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,759
best positioned let's say to be

281
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
recipient or importers or exporter

282
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,720
i'd like to bring attention to two in

283
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,559
particular that are often time at least

284
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,440
today

285
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,000
left aside india and china

286
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,240
so i said earlier that the cannabis

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
plant is not only one with medical and

288
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
recreational application but also

289
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,720
industrial application where well

290
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,759
until two years ago china was the number

291
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,639
one producer of hemp worldwide in fact

292
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,360
they produced over 90 percent of hemp

293
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,919
for textiles around the globe

294
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
today and by the way for those of you

295
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,799
who have had an opportunity to visit

296
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,000
china and i don't know how many of you

297
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,078
would have been interested in going to

298
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,120
the two provinces that actually do

299
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,000
produce it it is a pretty sophisticated

300
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,919
operation we're talking drones

301
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,078
the automation is incredible so china is

302
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,958
extremely well positioned to corner the

303
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,958
market and continue to corner the market

304
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,559
from a hand production perspective but

305
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,199
they haven't quite looked into the

306
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,399
extraction in cbd production so india

307
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,959
next door

308
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,879
sort of is now also looking at

309
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,799
potentially position themselves as a

310
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,799
massive producer producer of cbd

311
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,399
biomass for extraction you may ask

312
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,559
yourself why do i care is china and

313
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,200
india well you care because in this

314
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,919
global market they will have an impact

315
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,320
on pricing if you have such massive

316
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,319
nations producing massive amounts of

317
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,320
biomass

318
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,360
europe more specifically so this is the

319
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,838
state of affairs today so you can hear

320
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,480
you can see here sort of a breakdown of

321
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,720
adult use medical use

322
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720
with some exceptions in essence the

323
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,480
takeaway from here other than you know

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
keep track of what's happening in europe

325
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,720
is the fact that the european market

326
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,120
continues to be fragmented right we're

327
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,600
still trying to figure out how to truly

328
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,839
standardize and regulate

329
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,839
and legalize from a regional perspective

330
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,039
but more interesting let's talk about

331
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,200
what the key markets are today

332
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,719
and where are they going tomorrow

333
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,759
so

334
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,000
we've we've heard some some some various

335
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,000
um

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,958
assessments yesterday

337
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,360
um and in fact it was noted at some

338
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:52,638
point that it seems that everyone has a

339
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,360
different number that's not untrue

340
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,440
but we certainly begin to see

341
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,159
some consistency

342
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,839
in

343
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,480
who is on top and who are the top

344
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,959
markets so that you can actually sort of

345
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,200
take to the bank as i like to say

346
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:10,000
germany specifically

347
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,920
is a top market today and we predict

348
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,919
that it will continue to be a top market

349
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,719
tomorrow there has been discussion of

350
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,559
whether or not um consumption in germany

351
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,600
and other european nations have been

352
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,119
tapped

353
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,959
well the truth of the matter is that

354
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,200
when you look at it the illicit market

355
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,278
alone and its opportunity to be to

356
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
transition into the legal market we

357
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,159
haven't scratched the surface yet not to

358
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,720
mention the fact that they are

359
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,360
new consumers arising every day

360
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,879
and it's not consumers of thc it's

361
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,360
consumers of cbd products because of

362
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,879
wellness and we are in a time and era

363
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,600
where we're all taking better care of

364
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,198
our of our bodies and we care so that

365
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,720
market as far as we're concerned is

366
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,278
probably going to quadruple within the

367
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,519
next three to four years

368
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,559
followed by usual suspects netherland

369
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,839
italy poland united kingdom

370
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,559
and netherlands again

371
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,399
medical

372
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,799
europe by numbers so i really like this

373
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,240
slide and i mentioned it earlier

374
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,919
so

375
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,560
it should be no surprise that when you

376
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,278
look at the population of

377
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,719
africa and asia we expect those markets

378
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,559
to be massive but what's really

379
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,278
interesting is to look at the amount

380
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,359
spent per person and when you look at

381
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,600
that that is when north america and

382
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,000
europe truly shine but specifically

383
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,560
europe see the gap on the left charge

384
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,799
between the population and consumption

385
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,039
and on the right you see the opportunity

386
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,039
because while europe is already

387
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,319
showing sort of opportunity in terms of

388
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,240
spending

389
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,240
the number of countries that haven't yet

390
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:48,159
legalized is truly massive thus raising

391
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,159
rising raising that ceiling

392
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,759
and now we bring it back to germany

393
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,958
so what you're seeing here is a delta

394
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,639
between the illicit consumption and the

395
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,319
medical consumption

396
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,240
so i think we can all read graphs what

397
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,680
do we see we see the convergence of

398
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
those two lines

399
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,159
that means that as germany has legalized

400
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,079
we have seen a very effective if not

401
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,719
optimal transition from the illicit

402
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,479
market to the legal market and those two

403
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,480
lines will soon cross

404
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,559
and last but not least money

405
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,879
favorite topic

406
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,559
so i mentioned earlier that

407
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,799
in almost the last decade it's been

408
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,838
quite the journey

409
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,879
the cannabis industry has truly evolved

410
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,160
i have personally felt the evolution of

411
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,958
the money

412
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,519
conversation because as many of you i've

413
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:46,479
been raising money since 2014.

414
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,039
well between 2014 and 2015 i raised my

415
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,720
first 1 to 2 million dollars almost 50

416
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,120
000 at a time

417
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,120
that was a lot of fun

418
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,919
why because in between 2014 and 2016

419
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,679
2017 the truth of the matter is the size

420
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,439
of the checks and the types of investors

421
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,239
that entered this space were primarily

422
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,720
angel investors so small checks many

423
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
many transactions small checks what we

424
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,399
refer to as the green rush which was

425
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,959
primarily in the united states and north

426
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,399
america fast forward three years we

427
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,319
began to see

428
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,480
venture capital funds institutional

429
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,160
money family offices who began to

430
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,399
finally write million dollar checks

431
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,360
here's what what's exciting today we're

432
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,440
in what i call cannabis investment 3.0

433
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,278
fewer transactions let's be real truly

434
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,959
fewer transactions

435
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,480
but the size of those transactions are

436
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,039
becoming quite

437
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,120
impressive in fact here are a few now

438
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,198
we're beginning to see billion dollar

439
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,639
valuations now we're beginning to see

440
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,439
companies going

441
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,879
public in a mature and material manner

442
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,279
and now we're beginning to see also

443
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,360
investments from very large

444
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:55,838
multinationals across mature sectors

445
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,519
that have paid attention and now see a

446
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,519
massive opportunity in this industry

447
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,558
i leave you with a few questions at the

448
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,798
end of the day what do we do on new

449
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,519
frontier data is we try to

450
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,679
guess what's next no not guess predict

451
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,199
what's next and we can constantly

452
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,519
challenge ourselves with questions that

453
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,720
no one else is answering and these are

454
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,038
some of them

455
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,318
we've also just published a report

456
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,359

457
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,838

report that specifically looks at

460
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,798
thc adult use and the opportunity may

461
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,798
provide on a global scale

462
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,879
and with that i'm happy to take some

463

00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,719
least inquisitive

471
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,480
conference crowd

472
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,200
i mean not inquisitive but i'm saying

473
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,079

474
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,960

475
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,960

476
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,639
hi

477
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,399
thanks for the presentation very good

478
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
pleasure quick question

479
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,960
while i'm trying to get

480
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,918
or navigate through the information all

481
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
across

482
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,799
different sources right i've struggled

483
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,160
the most to find

484
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:26,720
information about consumers and about

485
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
drivers what drives them to consume did

486
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,880
someone plant you did someone plant you

487
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,440
because if my team did well done that's

488
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,960
a great question and just to finalize

489
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,679
that question is whatever i found

490
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,120
seems to be very polite answers you know

491
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
it's not

492
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,359
let's put it that way so it's i don't

493
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,359
think there are real answers you know

494
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,519
i'm and and and probably that is due to

495
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,079
many factors right but but

496
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,079
what would be your advice into getting

497
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,319
some sort of consumer

498
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,119
insights you've presented me the perfect

499
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,960
opportunity to plug new frontier data

500
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,918
again and i'm going to shamelessly take

501
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,558
it

502
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,320
so consumers in consumer the cannabis

503
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,079
consumer so first and foremost for those

504
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,439
of you who don't know the cannabis

505
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,519
consumer segment is the newest segment

506
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,640
that we have seen in the past 20 years

507
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,279
meaning

508
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,520
consumer package good and brands have

509
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,960
understood consumer behavior for many

510
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,679
many years and they're very comfortable

511
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,840
with it and here comes a brand new

512
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,960
consumer group with a completely unique

513
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,720
behavior truly unique behavior

514
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,960
we have been tracking this behavior for

515
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
almost a decade it's been very difficult

516
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
it's not easy

517
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,798
but we have and today we actually have

518
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,798
information and data on over 167 million

519
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,440
cannabis consumers which by the way

520
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,960
represents about 85 to 90 percent of

521
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,960
cannabis consumers across north america

522
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,038
so we are very interested in the

523
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,360
cannabis consumer and their behavior and

524
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,919
how to engage with them so your question

525
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,599
is how do you navigate and better

526
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,240
understand them

527
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,959
i will give you my card after this

528
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,079
after this presentation

529
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,319
so the types of questions that we get so

530
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,319
i've sort of alluded to it earlier there

531
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,480
are a lot of non-cannabis brands

532
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,759
entering the space i'll give you some

533
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
examples i'm not saying these other

534
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,798
companies because there's

535
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,200
confidentiality behind it but the likes

536
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,480
of lamborghini

537
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,960
mcdonald's

538
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,558
papa john's the body shop

539
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,319
nestle johnson and johnson l'oreal

540
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,158
what are all these companies want to

541
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,119
understand they want to understand how

542
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,240
can they

543
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,639
monetize and take advantage of this new

544
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,599
cannabis consumer group that is not only

545
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,440
consuming cannabis products but is also

546
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,519
consuming other products right if you

547
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,360
smoke and you get the munchies you may

548
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,639
want to go to mcdonald's well they want

549
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,798
to know where you are and how they can

550
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,480
get to you the types of questions that

551
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,798
we get are who are they where are they

552
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,798
how do they behave where do they go and

553
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,359
believe it or not today we have a lot of

554
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,359
visibility into that so i don't know if

555
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,359
if i answered your question but i can

556
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,399
certainly answer it in more detail

557
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,439
offline

558
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,159
how do you

559
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,798
how do you guys aggregate your data like

560
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,280
magic magic yeah that's what i figure

561
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,079
that's usually what it is alchemy yep

562
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,839
pretty much so crystal balls

563
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,639
that works too

564
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,158
so

565
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,400
it's actually a very very painful

566
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,280
process and it was even more painful

567
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,679
almost a decade ago primarily because as

568
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,960
you can imagine the the indus as i said

569
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,000
earlier the industry was born of a

570
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,079
movement so there were a lot of

571
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,319
cultivators in california that were

572
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,720
basically cultivating illegally they had

573
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:41,519
a bunch of money underground in big oil

574
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,759
barrels kids not true story and their

575
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,240
idea of inventory management was a

576
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,759
yellow pad and pencil so that it can be

577
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,679
erased or shredded

578
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,798
so collecting information early on was

579
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,880
extremely challenging today while we now

580
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,359
have point of sale solutions and we have

581
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
online nexuses loyalty programs and all

582
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,038
kinds of other

583
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,880
technologies that allow us access to

584
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,480
electronic stream of information those

585
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,679
allowing us better sourcing of

586
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,720
information

587
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,759
there's still a lot of

588
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,480
volatility if not lack of consistency

589
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,200
across systems as well as

590
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,038
as frameworks and in fact yesterday we

591
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,640
heard a little bit from metric and

592
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,400
others about the fact that is still

593
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,919
fragmented from a regulatory perspective

594
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,200
and the types of technologies that we

595
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,440
use however the short answer is we hook

596
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,480
up to a lot of other systems

597
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,240
including

598
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,720
doing things online and grabbing

599
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,038
information from local

600
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
state national and regional government

601
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,038
bodies to the to the extent that we can

602
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,880
get that information and then we license

603
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,279
and buy information from a lot of point

604
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,520
of sale solutions loyalty programs and

605
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,519
others we aggregate it and normalize it

606
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,038
over the last three years what surprised

607
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,719
you the most as you've looked through

608
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,919
this data what weren't you expecting to

609
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,600
happen and as a follow-up to that moving

610
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,840
forward looking into the next three

611
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,439
years what do you see as being the

612
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,879
biggest uncertainties that people

613
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,960
haven't thought about yet or that would

614
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
surprise you

615
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,079
my biggest surprise is that i'm still

616
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,079
standing has been quite the journey

617
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,798
the what happened at the un level

618
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,679
recently to me was somewhat surprising

619
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,519
especially given the environment we

620
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,519
couldn't have predicted covet and that

621
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,279
may have very well been a catalyst to

622
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,158
that movement

623
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,000
we knew that it was a global arena we

624
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,720
knew that we're going to see

625
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,200
legalization beyond north america we

626
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
didn't quite foresee that the the world

627
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
health organization united nations were

628
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,600
going to make such statements at that

629
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,038
point of time so that was certainly

630
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,959
surprising to me

631
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,480
in terms of surprises in the future and

632
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,720
maybe it's because i have a background

633
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,798
international relations

634
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,400
i'm very curious to see what happens

635
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,558
with china and india

636
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,200
they're massive it's just big numbers

637
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:04,879
and i'm in the business of numbers

638
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,840
if those two markets activate and and

639
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,480
flood

640
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,720
the industry it could have some pretty

641
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,720
serious impact whether good or bad

642
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,480
depending on where you stand but it

643
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,360
certainly would change

644
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,319
how the industry is evolving as well as

645
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:24,439
pricing and other things

646
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,439
thank you so much one more time
