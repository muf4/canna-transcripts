1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:16,890
a little overview let's hit for for Bill

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:20,009
Whitney everybody but waiting so I want

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,500
to thank ICBC for hosting this event and

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,590
I've been really impressed by not only

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,268
the quality of the speakers but also the

6
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,278
quality of the participants of the

7
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:32,098
conference so hats off to you guys

8
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,140
really appreciate it really appreciate

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,269
the opportunity to speak for in front of

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,308
you today um there'll be a little bit of

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,800
overlap from the previous preventer or

12
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:43,619
presenter but he seemed a little bit

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:47,549
preventer because he was telling it like

14
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:49,890
it is but you know so my name is beau

15
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,198
Whitney I'm the senior economist at new

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,689
frontier data and I've been in the

17
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,718
industry about five years now and never

18
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:59,968
in my wildest dreams did I think that as

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,120
an economist I'd be talking about weed

20
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,890
in Berlin you know I mean it's just

21
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,390
phenomenal but I think that's

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,140
representative of just the pace of the

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,719
transformation of the cannabis industry

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,259
so today I'm going to talk about a

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,109
global cannabis outlook I'm gonna first

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,900
talk high level and then pare it down

27
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:24,239
into the European Union I'm going to

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,790
talk about higher THC cannabis adult use

29
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,158
and medical but I also want to touch

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,210
upon this emerging industry of the

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,729
industrial cannabis as well so a little

32
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:38,489
bit about new frontier data new frontier

33
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:41,340
data is a independent technology driven

34
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,289
analytics company and we're specialized

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,368
in the cannabis industry

36
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,729
we offer vetted data that is actionable

37
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:53,159
it's good business intelligence and it

38
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:56,459
looks at risk management as well we're

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,170
four years old and we have in that for

40
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,530
years we've been cited in over 82

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,710
countries with our data we have a media

42
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,978
reach of 7 billion impressions so we've

43
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:12,620
really been considered an authority on

44
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:14,840
cannabis data so

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,569
the way that we get our data is that we

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,610
reach into certain aspects of the

47
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:24,139
industry all aspects so we get

48
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,720
governmental data NGO data stayed and

49
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,628
provincial regulator data and then we

50
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,459
also marry that with consumer data

51
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:34,729
ancillary data and point-of-sale data

52
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,319
and we agglomerate all that data into a

53
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:39,828
business intelligence portal called

54
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:43,339
eques o and then from there we can have

55
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:45,409
consumers subscribe to the portal or we

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:53,719
can do custom the report and advisory

57
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:57,530
services some of our business partners

58
00:02:53,719 --> 00:03:00,408
and clients are some of the largest in

59
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,590
the world from Bloomberg to Boston

60
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:06,108
Consulting Group but we've also touched

61
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,408
upon even the smallest of actors in the

62
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:11,930
space because we want to do our best to

63
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:18,019
look at all facets and all channels of

64
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:20,060
the market so over 60 countries around

65
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,939
the world have now legalized either

66
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,449
medical cannabis or industrial hemp and

67
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:29,780
so when you as operators and investors

68
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:30,318
even though it may be a local issue for

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,479
you

70
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:37,068
you really have to think global about

71
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:40,909
this you know we the previous presenter

72
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:44,030
talked about things going on in in South

73
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:46,400
Africa also you know advancements in

74
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,680
Mexico so there's this pace of

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,019
legalization that's sweeping the globe

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,680
and so this is a real exciting time to

77
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,680
be in this industry

78
00:03:53,889 --> 00:04:00,650
so in terms of total demand roughly

79
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:04,060
based upon our analysis roughly 6% of

80
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,010
the adults in the world have consumed

81
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,199
cannabis in the last year so that

82
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:12,259
translates into almost 300 million

83
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:15,109
consumers if you look at Germany right

84
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:17,509
now what arguably twenty to forty

85
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:20,150
thousand patients have used got

86
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:21,738
prescription in the last year so even in

87
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,288
Germany there's this huge untapped

88
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,689
market that's associated with cannabis

89
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:29,029
so cannabis is

90
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:32,980
this is just the tip of the iceberg in

91
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:36,169
terms of overall demand now some

92
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:40,939
continents have higher usage rates than

93
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:42,830
others it's not uncommon for consumers

94
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:46,639
and legal markets to have higher

95
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:49,609
percentage of usage rates Africa is has

96
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,370
a long tradition of cannabis use and and

97
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,129
cultivation and alike but Europe is

98
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:00,949
right about where the average is across

99
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:04,399
the globe 6% vs. 5.9 now how does that

100
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,469
translate into dollars well we are in

101
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,379
the process of publishing a global

102
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:13,880
reports on cannabis it's due out next

103
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:16,850
month and our forecasts for the total

104
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,649
globe with just higher THC cannabis not

105
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,230
including industrial hemp it's three

106
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:23,479
hundred forty four billion dollars and

107
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,759
it ranges from 200 billion to five

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,350
hundred billion but the midpoint is

109
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,149
right right around three hundred forty

110
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,420
four billion dollars so there's just

111
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:36,709
once again it's this huge market that is

112
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:40,960
relatively untapped so as consumers

113
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:43,939
transition from illicit to legal

114
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:47,180
there'll be this greater opportunity for

115
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:49,519
you as you get into this market Europe

116
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,000
is the third largest it's on our

117
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,009
forecast at sixty eight billion dollars

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,069
Asia is just this tremendous market a

119
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:03,310
lot of its population driven but it's

120
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:05,990
also usage driven as well now

121
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,540
although we're in Europe a lot of the

122
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,910
speakers have talked about the Canadian

123
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,620
market in the US market and I've seen a

124
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,250
lot of eye rolls from the Europeans

125
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,680
present here but it's because there's

126
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,839
this legal market and it's because of

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,389
the size of the market that it's setting

128
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,810
the precedent for other countries to

129
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:29,539
follow so Canada is making good inroads

130
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,379
on their legalization it's not without

131
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:36,080
its weaknesses but definitely it's it's

132
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:39,560
setting the stage for others to follow

133
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,129
but in 2018 or I'm sorry

134
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,139
twenty

135
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:45,329
19:16 billion dollars of legal sales in

136
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,060
Canada and the u.s. combined and that's

137
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:51,329
growing to thirty two billion dollars by

138
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,459
2025 so and that doesn't even include

139
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:56,728
some of the emerging states like New

140
00:06:53,459 --> 00:07:00,180
York New Jersey etc so the growth there

141
00:06:56,728 --> 00:07:03,930
is phenomenal and so you can ride the

142
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:10,350
tide now in order to capture larger

143
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:12,840
markets later now because there's this

144
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,680
popularity in the US because there's

145
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,689
this large market in the US and Canada

146
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,280
investment funds have been I'm investing

147
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:23,848
tremendous amounts into the cannabis

148
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:26,579
space so since 2015 over nineteen

149
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:30,348
billion dollars having been invested in

150
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:34,258
North America now how does that apply to

151
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:36,598
Europe well the 19 billion dollars is

152
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,120
being accumulated and then redeployed

153
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:42,120
into other markets like Europe like

154
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,769
Africa and Latin America but it's a

155
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,280
couple there's a couple of notable items

156
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:50,519
that the pace of this investment is

157
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:53,069
accelerating you know 13 almost 14

158
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,139
billion dollars of investment just last

159
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,449
year alone and it was driven primarily

160
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,930
by some of these large players into

161
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:03,000
space such as Constellation Brands then

162
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,150
in their investment into canopy growth

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,490
and then all Trias investment into

164
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:11,189
Cronos so combined they're it's almost

165
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,009
six billion dollars of investment and

166
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,680
what that means is that big actors big

167
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,379
players are coming into the space so if

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,610
you're a small actor that's already

169
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:26,610
established then you really should have

170
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:29,129
an exit strategy associated with this so

171
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,919
that either you can be acquired by the

172
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:33,990
large actors or that you can understand

173
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,528
where you're at relative to the market

174
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,060
so I know a lot of people say well why

175
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:42,418
should I have an exit strategy when I

176
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,218
haven't even begun operations but it's

177
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,039
really important to have that already

178
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,560
established so that when the market

179
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,539
turns or modernization of prices occur

180
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,029
then you'll know where you stand and you

181
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,599
can you know

182
00:08:53,029 --> 00:09:02,629
either get out or join forces with

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,550
others so in terms of the European

184
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,730
market like I mentioned 68 billion

185
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:09,909
dollars of the total addressable market

186
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,070
that's illicit and legal combined I

187
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:16,850
listed the top 15 markets here in

188
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,770
Germany ranks roughly third almost ten

189
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,470
billion dollars now all these numbers

190
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:24,139
are in dollars so I'm just moving

191
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,330
forward for the presentation but at 10

192
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:28,340
billion dollars that's a sizable market

193
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,690
it's relatively untapped it's only

194
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,430
medical but that's a huge opportunity

195
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,820
and so this is the attractiveness

196
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:40,009
because there's large markets there's

197
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,070
large potential and relatively untapped

198
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:46,730
that's why a lot of folks are preparing

199
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:50,260
to enter into this space either from

200
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,259
North America Latin America or Africa

201
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:59,270
now one of the ways that companies can

202
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,360
differentiate themselves is through

203
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:05,600
technology either to drive efficiencies

204
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,990
or differentiation and technology is

205
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:13,190
entering into this space at a massive

206
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,560
pace and it's disrupting a number of

207
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,110
sectors and all sectors actually so

208
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,109
between

209
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:24,250
cultivation processing delivery

210
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:29,450
mechanisms and data a lot of these are

211
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:33,589
are being invested in and disrupting so

212
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:36,730
you need to be aware as a as a investor

213
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:39,800
and as a operator that these

214
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,730
technological advances are occurring so

215
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:47,088
that you can keep pace with them now a

216
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:50,210
lot of these technology innovations are

217
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:52,670
because the consumer behavior is

218
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,830
changing as well so new frontier data

219
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:57,588
just published one of the largest

220
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,730
consumer data reports in the history of

221
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:05,000
cannabis and we its US and Canada based

222
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,920
but what we did is we did this consumer

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,749
survey and then we married

224
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,599
with six billion dollars of

225
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:14,298
transactional data to ascertain what the

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,850
consumer preferences were and then where

227
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,688
they sit relative to the overall use of

228
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,720
spectrum

229
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:23,208
so there's we've identified nine

230
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,999
different archetypes of consumers and

231
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:29,599
each one uses four different reasons

232
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:31,850
each one uses different amounts and they

233
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,069
have different preferences in terms of

234
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,609
delivery mechanisms and so this is

235
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:40,969
important to know as operators because

236
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:43,189
if you're targeting one product to the

237
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,499
wrong archetype then you're not going to

238
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:48,588
be successful so understanding the

239
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:50,418
consumer is critically important and now

240
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,319
for the first time we've got the data to

241
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:57,019
show the preferences and alike now

242
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:59,719
there's no longer just this medical and

243
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,178
recreational users and so this is a

244
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,639
deeper dive into the consumer behavior

245
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:10,970
and preference and so there's nuances

246
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:13,339
associated with this no it's interesting

247
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:16,278
based upon the survey results it's

248
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:19,339
interesting that the reasons that

249
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,948
consumers are using are not just for

250
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:25,699
social it's more so for wellness and

251
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:28,308
health and this is very interesting for

252
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:30,909
me because in yesterday's presentations

253
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:34,850
on the medical side there was a lot of

254
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:38,238
data being presented on the impact that

255
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:41,540
cannabis has on the human body and that

256
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:44,600
Alliance almost identically to what

257
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:48,308
consumers are using cannabis for for

258
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,519
relaxation stress relief sleep etc and

259
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:54,259
so this is what's surprising um

260
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,709
compared to what you know we were

261
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:01,339
talking about yesterday but if you look

262
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:02,808
at this only 19% use cannabis just

263
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:07,699
because they were bored you know I

264
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:10,938
wanted to do it socially now in addition

265
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:15,258
to that cannabis has medical

266
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:17,808
applications and 73% of the consumers

267
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:21,230
that are surveyed actually have used

268
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:24,799
cannabis as a substitute for other drugs

269
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:27,529
and this is showing up not only in

270
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,919
consumer patterns but also in federal

271
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:34,939
budgets and and the federal spending on

272
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:37,729
healthcare etc and so other countries

273
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,040
are interested in this development

274
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,139
because they want to look at their

275
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:45,409
healthcare expenditures in like Germany

276
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:47,779
for example and adjust accordingly and

277
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:52,240
support more cannabis use rather than

278
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:55,429
opioid use for as just an example but

279
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,350
94% of the consumers surveyed said that

280
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:00,349
when they use it for a medical reason

281
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:04,700
that there was some improvement and so

282
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:07,850
this is just another example of you know

283
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:14,240
why there's a benefit to doing more of a

284
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:17,269
deeper dive into the cannabis space no I

285
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,840
mentioned here's some data from the US

286
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:24,789
but I mentioned that as cannabis is used

287
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,950
as a substitute for other medicine

288
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:31,579
they're reducing the healthcare costs of

289
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:34,220
other at the federal level so in this

290
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,680
example 11 percent reduction in

291
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,500
governmental pain medicine spending for

292
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,779
healthcare so other countries are I'm

293
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,720
seeing this result in the United States

294
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:47,569
and as a result they're looking at this

295
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,120
as a way to adjust their healthcare

296
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:59,240
costs and address budget deficits in the

297
00:14:50,120 --> 00:15:02,750
life so as more and more researches out

298
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:08,090
there and more and more usage behaviors

299
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:11,110
change so does the demand for the the

300
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,700
canvas products and originally

301
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,000
especially in the United States this was

302
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:21,410
a flower play and the majority of the

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,289
demand was in flower form pre-rolls etc

304
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:27,199
but as delivery mechanisms and

305
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:29,029
technology came in innovation then there

306
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,280
was different product offerings to

307
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,159
different delivery mechanisms and as a

308
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:38,360
result the consumer preference

309
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,939
and purchasing patterns changed so you

310
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,579
know over you know five three year

311
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,339
period demand for flour went down thirty

312
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:47,958
nine percent in the United States

313
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:52,100
whereas there were increases in

314
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:54,078
concentrates edibles and other delivery

315
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,409
mechanisms so there's a fundamental

316
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,659
shift in away from flour and into

317
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:01,789
derivative products and this isn't just

318
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:06,068
a u.s. phenomena this is a phenomena

319
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:06,068
that exists in all the cannabis markets

320
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:15,079
so consumer preferences change as well

321
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,970
based upon other disrupting factors and

322
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,338
so we've listed five here I'm not going

323
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:24,528
to read this whole thing but essentially

324
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:28,250
as legal access expands as social

325
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:32,318
acceptance increases then the the

326
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:36,110
changes in preferences of the consumer

327
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:39,229
adjusts to the environment and so these

328
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:42,438
this is a transformational event where

329
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:45,409
consumers change their preferences

330
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:47,838
change what they consume and as business

331
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:50,600
owners and as investors you have to be

332
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,589
aware of these disruptive factors so

333
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,350
that you're not left behind and so new

334
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,079
frontier data can provide that level of

335
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,819
granularity and the data and so that you

336
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,658
can keep pace and understand the markets

337
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:08,750
better so I've talked a lot about higher

338
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:11,510
THC cannabis so I'd like to switch gears

339
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,259
a little bit to lower THC industrial

340
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:18,038
cannabis as well so because this is a

341
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:21,259
big market that is rather

342
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,699
underappreciated and so I wanted to talk

343
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:25,429
a little bit about this as well

344
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:28,120
because there's a lot of business that's

345
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:32,659
conducted in industrial hemp in Europe

346
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:34,399
so new frontier data just acquired the

347
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:36,860
hemp Business Journal it's a very

348
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,230
respected journal in the United States

349
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:42,918
and so we brought on expertise for

350
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:46,569
industrial hemp and so our forecast here

351
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,340
shows that on a global basis there

352
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:50,710
there's a three billion dollar global

353
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:51,759
market right now that's occurring this

354
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,970
is a legal market

355
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:58,360
I mean it's increasing its doubling

356
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,690
essentially over the next two years so

357
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:07,119
and Europe is the biggest driver right

358
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:09,610
now in industrial hemp but there's

359
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,959
emerging markets that are coming in that

360
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:19,719
could disrupt or displace Europe as one

361
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:22,329
of the more mature markets so just for

362
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,089
to level set the the bright shining

363
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:27,908
object these days is CBD and so

364
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:30,099
everybody is is focusing and on the CBD

365
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:32,049
market but there's industrial

366
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:34,839
applications consumer applications

367
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:38,788
textiles food supplements and the like

368
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:41,079
and you know for example BMW uses

369
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:43,658
industrial hemp on the interior of their

370
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,278
cars so there's this huge industrial

371
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:47,769
application associated with it that

372
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:50,349
nobody's really talking about but

373
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:59,919
there's a huge market well beyond the

374
00:18:50,349 --> 00:19:02,548
CBD play so I'm just I've got a few more

375
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,399
slides so I've got about five minutes so

376
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:08,740
hemp industry in Europe is farther along

377
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:11,829
now these are global numbers but they're

378
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,710
a billion-dollar market and textiles 800

379
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:18,759
million dollars and CBD for just hemp

380
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,829
derive CBD almost 800 million dollars in

381
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,628
industrial applications but if you look

382
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:25,178
closely at this chart you'll see that a

383
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:30,069
majority of this demand is being

384
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:34,450
satisfied by the European market and so

385
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:37,509
but as the US reacts a legalization of

386
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,879
industrial hemp look for the u.s. to

387
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:42,308
start flexing its muscle now there's

388
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:44,678
opportunities there that the Europeans

389
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:47,769
can take advantage of in the US market

390
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,710
so whereas a lot of other countries are

391
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:53,048
targeting the European market for market

392
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,240
entry strategies the Europeans with

393
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:57,730
their expertise in industrial hemp can

394
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,628
take advantage of the opportunities in

395
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,628
the US market as well

396
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:07,569
and the hemp market in Europe is very

397
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:10,750
diverse currently it's mainly on the

398
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:13,389
industrial like I mentioned and CBD but

399
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,069
the the market is shifting over more

400
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,280
towards consumer products and wellness

401
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:21,399
brands and so and that's just a small

402
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:25,200
percentage of the current revenues

403
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,200
derived from industrial hemp in Europe

404
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:32,410
now I talked about a little bit about

405
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:34,210
the demand for hemp products but it's

406
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,830
interesting on the supply side a lot of

407
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,279
the supply of industrial hemp products

408
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:43,509
is coming from China and Canada right

409
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:46,690
now with France also doing it being a

410
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:51,160
distant third in the space but look for

411
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:53,529
increases in cultivation not only in the

412
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:58,058
European Union but in places such as

413
00:20:53,529 --> 00:21:01,389
Africa and Asia and South America and

414
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:03,970
that in itself will have an effect on

415
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:07,059
pricing and the like commoditization of

416
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,799
pricing so as business owners in the

417
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:12,369
hemp space you're going to need to be

418
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:18,269
aware of those outside influences on

419
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:21,779
localized market so some key takeaways

420
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:24,730
300 million consumers huge opportunity

421
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:28,808
they're surging investment that is being

422
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:32,019
deployed around the globe but the CPG

423
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:33,879
entrants big tobacco alcohol pharma are

424
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:36,250
providing the liquidity for the

425
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,120
advancement and development of the

426
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,970
cannabis space if you are an operator

427
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:45,459
now be sure to use technology be sure to

428
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,319
use data in order to drive efficiencies

429
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,610
so you can keep pace with the

430
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:56,319
competition and you know the European

431
00:21:51,609 --> 00:22:00,428
market is a target of a lot of suppliers

432
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,899
from outside but what you'll see in the

433
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:08,050
coming years is that there's going to be

434
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:09,460
a consolidation but overall just in some

435
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,629
right now because I want to give some

436
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,759
time for questions

437
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:20,280
you know this is a global market 60

438
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:23,279
countries and then some and you're here

439
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:26,879
in Berlin you're operating in Germany or

440
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:30,180
France or Italy what have you you really

441
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,870
have to think about the global aspect of

442
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:37,500
this and and adjust accordingly so as

443
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:40,409
you act local you have to think global

444
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,180
otherwise you'll be left behind and

445
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,040
there's this tremendous opportunity that

446
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,130
you just you want to take advantage of

447
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,289
right now so at that point thank you

448
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:52,200
very much for for listening I'll take a

449
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:55,889
few questions if there are any thank you

450
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,679
very much but let's hear it for both we

451
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,960
have time for one or two quick questions

452
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,630
there's one over there please be brief

453
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,039
no rambling we're trying to catch up I

454
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,260
know we started a little late everybody

455
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,909
was a little how do you say hungover in

456
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:14,579
German hey thanks for taking my question

457
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,500
in Canada there's been some anecdotal

458
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:18,470
evidence fairly convincing but still

459
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,819
anecdotal that people have been

460
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,460
rejecting what they perceive as poor

461
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:27,178
quality government weed and staying with

462
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,370
their supplier do you see that the black

463
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:33,480
market presents any challenges at this

464
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:35,329
point or has that ship sailed the way

465
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,920
that I view the the illicit market

466
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:40,409
relative to legal market is not

467
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,650
necessarily on quality it's based upon

468
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,779
price we've done elasticity analysis

469
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:49,230
which means pricing sensitivity by the

470
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:52,710
consumer and the data is very convincing

471
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,960
that if that consumers don't want to pay

472
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:58,440
too much of a premium to do things

473
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,450
legally so as a result if there are tax

474
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,940
too much if there's too much of a price

475
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,850
markup they'll just revert back to the

476
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,279
elissa market so with respect to Canada

477
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:10,469
what's occurring there is that due to

478
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,410
supply shortages and the like the lack

479
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:16,610
of access at the retail level there's

480
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,990
not enough supply and so prices are high

481
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:22,859
especially with a one dollar per gram

482
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:25,039
tax that's just asinine but so what it's

483
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,199
doing is it's driving the

484
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,259
the consumer back into the illicit

485
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,860
market so once prices commoditized and

486
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:35,629
lower and they're more price competitive

487
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:37,699
relative to the illicit market then

488
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,340
you'll see more market conversions the

489
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,519
the consumer conversion i've modeled it

490
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:47,899
it's super easy to predict and it's all

491
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:49,250
based upon price all right well thank

492
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:54,890
you very much let's hear one more time

493
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:57,230
but whitney the vp from new frontier

494
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,970
data that was very informative and we

495
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,180
really appreciate you brother thanks for

496
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,180
coming
