14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,399
pleasure to speak for such a wonderful

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,480
audience here about the medical cannabis

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,520
developments in Germany and coming back

17
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:52,238
to difficult uh I don't know whether you

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,359
have listened recently to German

19
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,119
politicians because they are using the

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,480
word difficult very often also in the

21
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,640
connection with cannabis and if you look

22
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:04,599
into what they really mean what

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,359
difficult means it looks like it's a

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,478
synonym for either

25
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,840
unacceptable out of question or

26
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,640
outrageously stupid so if ever a

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,118
politician is used difficult you have to

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,319
really look what he is meaning and

29
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,000
having said that I would like to make a

30
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,639
couple of remarks before I start my

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,040
presentation

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,478
um about our discussion which we had

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,479
earlier today the question question was

34
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,438
from one of the of the audience say use

35
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,359
the other microphone maybe you can't

36
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:42,279
hear me this one might be easier for us

37
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,280
to hear this one's a little a

38
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:50,840
little yeah try that okay wow good

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,799
wonderful you hear me better great uh I

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,478
think somebody asked of you should

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,719
Slovenia copy the German model uh the

42
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,599
answer is that would be

43
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,759
difficult uh

44
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,239
because they are they are you have to

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,079
differentiate between the recreational

46
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,478
part of course and the medical part the

47
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,199
recreational part and thank you very

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,599
much uh my my dear friend that you left

49
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,719
the medical part for me this afternoon

50
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:19,719
uh the recreational part which you so

51
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,759
nicely outlined today uh is a step

52
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,680
forward but not what actually everybody

53
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,560
wanted uh and I will come back to that

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,439
in a minute but with respect to the

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,039
medical part

56
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:37,919
uh it is from my point of view a good

57
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:39,639
model to look at and in the next 30

58
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,439
minutes I'm going to show you a little

59
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:46,318
bit why it is a good uh model to look at

60
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,919
even for Slovenia it has a number of

61
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,119
advantages and I would say it is really

62
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,158
a success story since we started with

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,120
the legalization of medical cannabis in

64
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:59,000
Germany back in

65
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,599
2016 the other part the recreational you

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,039
know uh as as I said it's difficult uh

67
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:09,158
you may not uh copy it in any way

68
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:12,439
besides the fact me as a lawyer I would

69
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:16,479
never advise on copying something not

70
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:19,479
even the law it would be like I would uh

71
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,199
actually uh recommend copying the German

72
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,518
employees invention act which is the

73
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,000
most elaborated most difficult act

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,319
regarding this topic to a Japanese

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
employer so looking at it having look at

76
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,958
the advantages and of course then use

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
them and Slovenia is now on the move

78
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,560
into the medical cannabis Market into

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,919
the medical cannabis field uh it may be

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,759
worthwhile to consider what Germany has

81
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,238
done so here's the outline what I what I

82
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,919
would like to discuss with you this

83
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,158
afternoon first of all a very brief

84
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:59,199
review how did it all happen why why is

85
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,560
actually Germany so now in Europe in the

86
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,598
Forefront

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,759
of the medical Canabis market then of

88
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,280
course we have a look what has actually

89
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,878
happened since 2016 what has recently

90
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,239
happened uh since the legalization of

91
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:17,399
recreational or partial legalization of

92
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,079
recreational cabus uh in Germany and

93
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,879
then of course we look into the

94
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,960
potential problems which this all may or

95
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:27,000
may not cause in the future also take

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,079
into consideration that we have

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,560
elections next year and the government

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,839
may change you may have looked at what

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,600
has happened in Germany politically just

100
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:42,038
recently so there is a likelihood that

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,199
the current Coalition will not be in the

102
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:48,918
represented in the government next end

103
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,520
of next year so having said that let's

104
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:54,478
have a look into the

105
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,839
development before the year

106
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:02,038
2016 uh there was the possibility for

107
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:06,038
medical patients to apply for an special

108
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:08,959
permission to use cannabis as a medicine

109
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:11,519
for the treatment of their

110
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:16,159
diseases uh one of those patients

111
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:20,079
actually started to or wanted to grow at

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,280
home the hom grow model uh and he got a

113
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,318
Sease and desist order from the Barm

114
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:28,559
which is the federal uh medical

115
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:32,800
Authority very much like the FDA in in

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,038
the US and he went to court and in June

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,120
2016 the matter was taken up by uh the

118
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,199
highest uh uh in April of 2016 by the

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,199
highest administrative Court in Germany

120
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:49,919
and they allowed him to cultivate

121
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,478
cannabis for his treatment at home which

122
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,038
for at that point in time was a

123
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:58,279
nightmare for the legislator and they

124
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,199
came up with the respective rotes and

125
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,279
regulations for narcotic

126
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,598
or the use of a narcotic meaning

127
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:09,559
cannabis as a medicine in June

128
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:12,719
2016 in March 2017 it all became legal

129
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,959
uh and since then and that's now I think

130
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,400
the important

131
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:20,680
Point since then cannabis can be

132
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,959
prescribed as a medicine and why has

133
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,639
that been so outstandingly important

134
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,839
number one uh it has been defined as an

135
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,478
extemporaneous mixture we were talking

136
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,000
this morning about finished products and

137
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,758
the development of finished products and

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,720
finished products as you know need of

139
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,598
course a marketing

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,240
authorization and for a marketing

141
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,598
authorization you need costly clinical

142
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,560
trials uh with the consequence that if

143
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:49,879
the trial fails you have lost a

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,959
significant amount of money and of

145
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,439
course also reputation for that specific

146
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:58,399
product and it can only be done for a

147
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:02,439
certain indication so the importance of

148
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,079
the definition of cannabis as an

149
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,160
extemporaneous mixture cannot be

150
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,000
underestimated because as an

151
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,680
extemporaneous mixture and it come back

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,160
to that in a minute you do not need any

153
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,639
kind of clinical

154
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,479
trials The Physician can prescribe

155
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,120
cannabis for the treatment of his

156
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:23,159
disease the patient gets a prescription

157
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,720
goes to the pharmacy the pharmacist is

158
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,319
preparing the product according to the

159
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,759
prescription and is handing it over so

160
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,400
no need for cl trials no need for

161
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:37,319
marketing authorization as cannabis in

162
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:40,560
Germany is defined as an exmor mixture

163
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,080
first important Point secondly there is

164
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,439
no limitation no official limitation at

165
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,439
least on the therapies which indications

166
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,240
we have that in the UK as you know we

167
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,079
have a very limited indication for which

168
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,000
cannabis can be prescribed that's not

169
00:07:54,079 --> 00:08:00,519
the case in Germany in Germany each and

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,720
every physician can actually decide

171
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,758
whether cannabis would could be used as

172
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,039
a treatment for the disease of that

173
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,598
specific patient and he can select today

174
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,519
out of 400 different flower products

175
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,199
which are on the market in order to

176
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:21,439
treat the patient second very important

177
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,280
point and last but not least this

178
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,439
product the extor mixure product does

179
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,719
not need to go through a price finding

180
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,959
process with regard to the reimbursement

181
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,879
for patients you know we have a

182
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:39,719
very detailed health insurance system in

183
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,719
Germany so everybody has a health

184
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,000
insurance and these products these

185
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,160
treatments with cannabis are going to be

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,480
reimbursed by the health insurance

187
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,759
companies upon a specific application by

188
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,839
the patients together with the

189
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,958
Physicians to be

190
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,720
reimbursed at in the Years 2017 and

191
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,359
following our on 60% of these

192
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,440
applications have been granted uh and

193
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,639
the health insurance companies have

194
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,839
reimbursed the patients for their

195
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,958
treatment today we will look at that in

196
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,040
a minute Everything Has Changed on that

197
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:18,838
but that way are the important points uh

198
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:21,120
which uh actually led to uh an increase

199
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,160
of patients an increase of prescriptions

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,560
since

201
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:29,360
2017 in April 2024 as I just mentioned

202
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:33,719
and Kai has outlined this very nicely to

203
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,360
today uh the K the new cannabis act came

204
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,079
into force and with that the medical

205
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,879
cannabis act which contains also of

206
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,159
course new provisions on the medical

207
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,759
cannabis prescriptions and we will look

208
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,759
at that in a

209
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,440
minute so what are the significant

210
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,959
changes since

211
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,440
2017 well there are new prescription

212
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,039
requirements what has Germany done with

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
the partial legalization for the

214
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,120
recreational market and we mentioned

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,560
that this morning whether Slovenia

216
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,560
should go into the right in this

217
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,919
direction as well and I think you have

218
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,599
mentioned it here jper this morning in

219
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:18,599
your presentation Germany has taken

220
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:23,600
cannabis out of the German narcotics

221
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,278
act it cannabis is not longer uh a

222
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,159
narcotic it has been transferred into

223
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,519
the Cannabis law in the new cannabis law

224
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,838
that doesn't mean that you can do

225
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,959
everything with cannabis right now

226
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,000
because the same limitations which we

227
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,399
had before with some exceptions which we

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,639
have seen on the recreational side this

229
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,720
morning apply to cannabis as well so you

230
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,560
cannot actually freely trade it you

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,160
cannot actually sell it you can grow it

232
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,638
at home as we have heard this morning uh

233
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,199
and of course these cultivation

234
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,519
associations are going to be established

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,759
and of course hopefully the the pilot

236
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,480
projects scientifically controlled pilot

237
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,639
projects will be established but what is

238
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,440
important is is that this this decision

239
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,639
has an influence on the medical

240
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,639
Market why because now Physicians are

241
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,919
not going to prescribe a

242
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,720
narcotic uh with which is significantly

243
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,479
more difficult than prescribing just a

244
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,360
regular RX product so that has changed

245
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,320
since the 1 of April this year so very

246
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,720
brand new that every physician can

247
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,160
actually now prescribe cannabis as a

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,360
regular RX product it's not longer

249
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,399
narcotic so this eliminates of course a

250
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,639
number of bureaucratic requirements not

251
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,200
only for the Physicians who actually had

252
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,000
to register with the B form to prescribe

253
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,440
to be allowed to prescribe Canabis but

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,600
also for the pharmacies of course they

255
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,959
have to safeguard the Cannabis it's

256
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,600
still a a product which has certain

257
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,679
requirements but uh it is it is not

258
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,278
longer a

259
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,958
narcotic the next big issue and that has

260
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,399
an impact on the future businesses which

261
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,599
we will see as well is that the

262
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,120
requirement for cultivation medical

263
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,920
cannabis in Germany has been

264
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,120
significantly

265
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:20,958
changed uh you may know that after

266
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:25,278
2017 the bform the federal health agency

267
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:28,479
or medical agency has tendered out uh to

268
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,679
the public uh the possibility to

269
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,560
cultivate medical cannabis in Germany

270
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,278
and three companies actually finally

271
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:38,638
succeeded in that long winding process

272
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,759
who actually were allowed to cultivate

273
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,240
10.4 metric

274
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:47,799
tons in four years which mean 2.6 tons

275
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,519
metric tons per year plus a threshold

276
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,759
additional threshold of

277
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,839
10% which is compared to the actual

278
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,360
consumption we will see that in a minute

279
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,079
is a fraction of what is actually needed

280
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,360
in the medical Market this has been

281
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:06,759
changed which means every uh producer

282
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,199
who thinks he is in a position he can

283
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:13,879
actually cultivate cannabis can apply

284
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,799
now to the Cannabis agency to get a

285
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,559
license for the cultivation of medical

286
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,278
cannabis which of course we all know is

287
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,039
not easy because of the quality

288
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,399
requirements at least the security

289
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,879
requirements they will not be

290
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,559
loosened and all those three who

291
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,600
actually won the tender back in 2019 if

292
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,239
I'm not mistaken taken all those three

293
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,278
have already applied to increase the

294
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,320
quantity for the cultivation of cannabis

295
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,120
in Germany for the medical market and

296
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,160
have all been granted as of today

297
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,159
respective permissions to increase

298
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,240
significantly the production the

299
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,799
cultivation of their medical cannabis

300
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,799
products which will have a significant

301
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,719
impact on the market as well in

302
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:58,359
particular for those exporters from

303
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,000
Canada uh the Netherlands and other

304
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,839
countries I come back to that at the end

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,240
of my

306
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,120
presentation so all this

307
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,079
has a significant impact on the medical

308
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,879
Market as you see so it's not only since

309
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:15,599
April 1st we have a partial recreational

310
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,439
Market all the decisions made there had

311
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,680
an impact on the medical Market as well

312
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,680
to its

313
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,360
advantages I have uh now three charts

314
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,159
which I would like to show you the first

315
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,120
one is uh the comparison between the s

316
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,480
imated Demand versus the actual import

317
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,639
of medical cannabis unfortunately the

318
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,680
actual figures for 2022 and 2023 are not

319
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,320
yet available I have other data which

320
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,198
are a little bit more actual than these

321
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:48,199
ones but what you can see is actually

322
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:50,278
that uh the respective demand which the

323
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,639
so-called bundus opion shell which is

324
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,480
actually Department of the the German

325
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,240
Bay Farm uh has actually

326
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,560
estimated uh because this has to be and

327
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,799
that's important also Al for Slovenia

328
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,919
you have to actually indicate to apply

329
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:10,919
to the incb the international narcotic

330
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:13,599
control board uh for getting permission

331
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,639
to import cannabis for medical purposes

332
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
you cannot just order it so the

333
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,198
government in in this case through its

334
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,000
respective Ministry or through the

335
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:25,599
respective agency has to apply for the

336
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,519
importation of cannabis into the

337
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,199
respective local market uh and gets it

338
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,440
usually

339
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:34,958
granted uh so there is it's not a big

340
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,440
hurdle but it's a formal process which

341
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,198
each country who's going to import

342
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,800
medical cabus has to

343
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:44,359
follow and you can see here that the

344
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,639
originally the estimation was

345
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,039
significantly higher than the actual

346
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,360
Imports uh but uh in 2021 it already

347
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:55,838
leveled out uh and it will probably be

348
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,639
leveled out but significantly increased

349
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,199
for the next years so if you look into

350
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,720
that here now I have some more actual

351
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:06,559
figures which are the Imports of

352
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,040
cannabis by quarter from the year 2017

353
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,559
to

354
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:16,318
20124 you see a significant increase

355
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:19,838
over the years in kilogram uh and in

356
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:22,120
2024 in particular in the second quarter

357
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,680
uh we have significant increase the

358
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,919
figures uh estimated for the third and

359
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,198
fourth quarter 2024 are even

360
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,838
significantly higher why I will show you

361
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:36,399
in a minute what kind of impact the

362
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,600
recreational changes had on the medical

363
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,399
market and last but not least these are

364
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,639
the number of prescriptions within the

365
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,958
framework of cedary Health insurances

366
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,278
these are only those patients

367
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,679
prescriptions which you are registered

368
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:53,399
with their health insurance which who

369
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,559
get reimbursed today and you will see

370
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,159
that in a minute we have a much more

371
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:02,159
self-pay Market which has been increased

372
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:04,959
over the last couple of months uh and as

373
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,599
such that is a figure which is only

374
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,798
looking into those patients who have

375
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,558
actually been reimbursed by their uh

376
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,240
health insurance companies and you see

377
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,480
that there is a significant increase uh

378
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,599
we are uh this prescriptions not

379
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,078
patients but today I think we are

380
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,198
looking into what I would say around

381
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,639
100,000 patients uh currently under

382
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,480
treatment with medical cannabis in

383
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,840
Germany which to a certain extent is for

384
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,759
all those who are in the business little

385
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,240
bit disappointing because everybody

386
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:40,038
thought the market which would be higher

387
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,200
but nevertheless it is by far the

388
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:46,798
largest markets uh in in Europe with

389
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,558
over well I would say 100,000 patients

390
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,160
if you look into the other markets it's

391
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:54,319
29,000 patients for Italy Netherlands

392
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,480
around 9,000 patients and Poland 5,200

393
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:01,639
that is of course also due to the fact

394
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,679
that there their prescription policy is

395
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,880
different so the sales in the medical

396
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,038
Market in Germany are actually to be

397
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,000
expected around half a billion in 2024

398
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,839
which is I would say already significant

399
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,440
increasing by estimated four

400
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,639
approximately 4% per year I believe it

401
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,759
will be probably higher and that market

402
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,720
is going to hit I would say in 2029

403
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:33,200
though 5 years from now from my

404
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:37,000
expectations uh the 1 billion uh Euro

405
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,240
Mark Mark uh this is very

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,240
conservatively uh

407
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,519
calculated so coming back to the latest

408
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,200
developments and we are now in September

409
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:54,759
2024 so such uh developments just took

410
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,159
place between first of April and now uh

411
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:00,119
the medical cannabis Market has

412
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,799
significantly increased

413
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,959
of course through the facts which I

414
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:06,918
mentioned before the change in the

415
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,200
prescription uh

416
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:15,600
requirements uh and what has happened

417
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:18,720
actually is that shortly after the uh

418
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:23,519
legalization of recreational pabis there

419
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,440
were it platforms created it platforms

420
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,918
which are bringing together Physicians

421
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,759
patients and pharmacies

422
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:37,679
so today actually a patient can actually

423
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:41,200
book uh an appointment with uh a

424
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,240
physician via this platform he can use

425
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,720
tele

426
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,599
medicine uh for his

427
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,519
consultation and is getting then an

428
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,038
electronic

429
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,519
prescription either directly to the

430
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:58,720
pharmacy or back to him and then can

431
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,720
actually uh get his cannabis even with

432
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,038
without having a physical appointment

433
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,319
with a physician delivered to his

434
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,158
doorstep and if you look into the

435
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:13,119
various different platforms there and we

436
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,919
are advising five of them uh there are

437
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,639
of

438
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:21,000
course some means which may be at least

439
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,400
questionable for example uh some of them

440
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
are using Physicians not in Germany but

441
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,720
outside of Germany within the European

442
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,640
Union for example in Croatia where the

443
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,360
requirements for a tele medicinal

444
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,120
consultation are

445
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:39,038
significantly losen in comparison to

446
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,759
Germany so he doesn't even has to see

447
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:45,400
the patient he just files in a

448
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,960
questionnaire uh with uh all his data

449
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,919
and is getting the his prescription or

450
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,319
even not but most of them are getting

451
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,640
the prescription to deliver it to him he

452
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,399
can then actually go to the online

453
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,038
pharmacy file his prescription and gets

454
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,440
the back to deliver to his

455
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:09,119
doorstep uh I have here citations of all

456
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,640
of three cannabis companies these are

457
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:15,359
importers or Distributors which is

458
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,600
canash Kiva and Canam medical and you

459
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,558
see that they have a significant

460
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,240
increase in business so all the facts

461
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,038
and figures which you saw on the chge

462
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,519
will be significantly higher in the

463
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:31,000
third and fourth quarter

464
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:35,278
2024 alone Canam medical actually

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,440
forecasts a 7 to 10 fold increase in

466
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:41,000
sales so you can say well are they all

467
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,320
patients or do we see kind of a shift

468
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,720
from the recreational Market into the

469
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:49,879
medical

470
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,640
Market uh probably yes uh but on the

471
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,400
other hand to make it easier for

472
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,038
patients to get a prescription is a good

473
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,519
thing there's no doubt about that and I

474
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:00,440
have been in the pharmaceutical industry

475
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:04,599
for many years and and uh I'm I'm

476
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,240
definitely one of those who supports the

477
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,719
use of medical cannabis as an

478
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,480
alternative medicine for various uh Inc

479
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,440
diseases for various indications and I

480
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,839
think we are definitely going in the

481
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,640
right into the right

482
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:22,639
direction uh whether the prescription

483
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,600
policy which is so liberal currently in

484
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,440
Germany for the prescribing cannabis

485
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,480
will stay in place for the next years I

486
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,720
can't tell you because the authorities

487
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,919
are already very much looking into these

488
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:41,919
kind of it platforms and distributions

489
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:45,880
of cannabis however uh this is all

490
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,919
legal because we have uh respective

491
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,120
Arrangement between the European member

492
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,640
states that of course a physician in a

493
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:54,918
different member State can actually

494
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,520
prescribe cannabis for a patient who is

495
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,759
residing in in another state uh whe

496
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,798
whether this has been foreseen here or

497
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,759
not is a different

498
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,359
question

499
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:10,919
so if you look into what has happened

500
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:14,599
since further what happened since then

501
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,559
uh is that 80% of the current cannabis

502
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,439
prescriptions are

503
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:23,240
self-pairs the ratio was totally

504
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,759
different it was 60 to 40 u in shortly

505
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,720
after the legalization of medicinal

506
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:31,599
cannabis but now it's really 80% our

507
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,240
self payers uh which is which is

508
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,240
surprising or not surprising very much

509
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,440
depending how you see

510
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,640
that um what is also important is that

511
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,798
the so-called GBA which is the federal

512
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,759
joint committee which is the highest

513
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,639
self-governing body within the German

514
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:53,798
Healthcare System will loen the

515
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:56,278
requirements of applying to the health

516
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:59,200
insurances before the treatment this

517
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:01,480
cannabis will start so

518
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,038
which is by the way kind of strange

519
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,919
because there is from my point of view

520
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:08,720
no other RX product where patient has

521
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,559
actually to file an application to his

522
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,919
health insurances to get reimbursement

523
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:19,119
first before the treatment starts so uh

524
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:21,759
there will be now a group of Physicians

525
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,079
probably those specialized groups like

526
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,519
Physicians who have are specialized in

527
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:30,000
in pain treatment where this actually

528
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,879
requirement will be

529
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,839
waved so last but not

530
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,480
least despite the partial

531
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:41,199
legalization uh there are currently as

532
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,360
we said this morning no ways to buy

533
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,600
recreational Cannabis freely in Germany

534
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,439
which for my point of view would be the

535
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:53,240
ultimate solution in order to fulfill

536
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,558
the arguments for legalization for the

537
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,880
the legalization of cannabis which is a

538
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:02,278
of course uh protecting the use uh B to

539
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,080
deliver better products to the

540
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,038
recreational users and C to attack the

541
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:10,240
black

542
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:12,599
market um however this is not this is

543
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,000
still on hold as we all know because of

544
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,678
the legal requirements or the legal

545
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
hurdles which the European commission

546
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,200
has actually established within the

547
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,558
European Union and of course Germany

548
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,080
didn't want to go to the European court

549
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,319
of justice they if you may remember they

550
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,519
J the German government had just big

551
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,158
losses before the European Court of

552
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:36,759
Justice the first one was with regard to

553
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:39,159
that uh car fees or uh the respective uh

554
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,640
payment for using the German autobound

555
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,039
also for pro private cars uh and the

556
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,640
second one was with regard to the

557
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,480
storage of personal data for a longer

558
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,880
period of time so they didn't want to

559
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,038
risk again losing before the European

560
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,960
court of justice and as such actually

561
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:56,679
went back to that Recreation partial

562
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,240
recreational system which we saw uh this

563
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,120
morning

564
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,960
however uh looking into what is going to

565
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,719
happen in the

566
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,558
future these two questions I think are

567
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,798
imminent the first one is Will

568
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,278
legalization lead to patients buying

569
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,519
cannabis for recreational purposes

570
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:20,599
instead of medical cannabis or will both

571
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:24,639
industry be able to fully uh coexist

572
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:26,359
well we saw that in in Canada after this

573
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
I would say full legalization where

574
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:33,439
everybody can actually buy every ad can

575
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,360
buy uh cannabis in a uh in a licensed

576
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,038
shop uh the medical Market went not sign

577
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,759
significantly but went down here in

578
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,879
Germany through that system which we

579
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,679
have implemented for partially partial

580
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,440
legalization of recreational cannabis in

581
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,559
first of April the opposite was the

582
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,038
case so well obtaining recreational

583
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:57,079
Cannabis through fewer bureaucratic

584
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:59,000
huddles of course has its it's uh its uh

585
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,119
benefits however ever whether is going

586
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,599
to be in the future is difficult to say

587
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,439
uh the approach which you heard this

588
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:09,199
morning of various European countries to

589
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,880
try to change that policy for

590
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,960
recreational Cannabis within the

591
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,919
European Union is the right step to of

592
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,200
doing that last but not least will there

593
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,840
be any changes with regard to Imports of

594
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,960
medical cannabis will they decrease

595
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:28,240
drastically uh the answer to that is yes

596
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,919
I think so more and more and of of

597
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
course all those cultivators which are

598
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,278
already present in Germany uh more and

599
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,960
more cultivators will be coming up

600
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:41,720
to cultivate medical cannabis in Germany

601
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,319
with the consequence that the more you

602
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,519
domestically

603
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:50,639
produce the less you are allowed to

604
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:53,679
import though the incb is of course

605
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,840
monitoring not only the Imports of a

606
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,600
country but also what the country

607
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,599
actually self- cultivates and I can tell

608
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,319
you that these three cultivators already

609
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:07,678
are looking into significantly

610
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,678
broadening their portfolio with other uh

611
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,120
plants with other uh seeds which they

612
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,759
are going to import in order to really

613
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:18,599
be competitive on that market with the

614
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,919
consequence that if they come to the

615
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:25,719
market which will be in due course then

616
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,440
of course the import quota for medical

617
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,159
cannabis will be reduced which has a

618
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,200
significant imp impact of course on the

619
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:37,679
respective exporters from of course

620
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,240
Canada the the Netherlands and

621
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,000
others having said

622
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,440
that the situation with regard to

623
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,440
medical cannabis from my point of view

624
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,360
is a model which I think to a certain

625
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,440
extent can not be copied but can be

626
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,678
implemented by others it is a success

627
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:03,440
story with respect to the changes in the

628
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,480
recreational Market I would say they

629
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,720
have

630
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,839
been difficult thank you very much all

631
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,839
right let's hear it from Peter harber

632
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,689
[Applause]
