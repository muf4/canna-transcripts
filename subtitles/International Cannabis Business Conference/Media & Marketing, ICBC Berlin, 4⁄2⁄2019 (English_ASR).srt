1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:07,649
yeah welcome to the media and marketing

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:10,230
panel here on the ICBC I think this is

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,750
gonna be one of the very few billing

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,170
your channels because I can introduce

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,509
three journalists from - from Germany

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,380
and one run of us from the United States

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,689
and I decided because it's about German

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,910
language it's a language panel and so I

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,028
decided to hold it in two languages so

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,350
as Anthony said please get your headsets

11
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:36,058
if you need translation so I'm proud to

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,489
present first

13
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,269
next to me is of villiage on Affiliate

14
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:44,968
Ron alia is a founder of Stockport

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,820
images and founder of Asian Americans

16
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,370
for cannabis education and before

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,140
anybody asked she's not related to Tommy

18
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:58,169
Chong she's independent she's driven to

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,570
help shape the new conversation of

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,309
cannabis and is guided or by one mission

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,829
to advocate for the legalization of

22
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:08,368
cannabis and offer truthful reflections

23
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:11,640
of end of the faces and communities that

24
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,799
embrace cannabis is that right yes and

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,310
let's start with the first question

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,250
Celia please cannabis is B market - the

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,350
main street without segmentation which

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,750
ignores the diversity of the consumers

29
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:29,728
how do you suggest cannabis companies

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,680
evolve their marketing well in in the

31
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,109
States we are a little further ahead on

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,810
education we have a lot of media outlets

33
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,359
that talk about what CBD is and what THC

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,368
is and also the history of cannabis

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,930
started in California with proposition

36
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:47,969
215 in 1996 we were allowed to have

37
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,618
medical marijuana right that's what we

38
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:52,560
call it medical marijuana for patients

39
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:55,920
has started by the LGBTQ community

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,478
Dennis Peron and others to bring

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,739
medicine to people with cancer and AIDS

42
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,409
because they were tired of getting

43
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,419
arrested in a park buying medicine for

44
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,880
their for their partners for their

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,590
family and also brownie Mary was there

46
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,810
too she was basically a mother of

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,640
edibles she made brownies for her

48
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,039
patients who are cancer and AIDS

49
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,408
patients cuz they couldn't

50
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,959
they could only eat small amount so she

51
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:20,539
made extremely potent brownies and so

52
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,060
brownie Mary is the mother of edibles

53
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,699
basically so they're all arrested and

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,658
they brought cannabis to California so

55
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:32,689
we've had it since 1996 legally and the

56
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:35,419
the best growers are in California so

57
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:37,908
how to market it is we went from the

58
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:40,518
underground to above-ground and so now

59
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:43,219
we have to educate everybody else and

60
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,650
what CBD is what THC is and and so we

61
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:48,560
get a lot of well if I take CBD well it

62
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,769
make me high and I said no it would it

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,920
won't it has a different feeling for

64
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:57,379
it's a different cannabinoid thats going

65
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:00,318
to go into your your body for what you

66
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:01,969
need and tc's should be along with it

67
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,388
for entourage so it's really educating a

68
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:08,750
lot of people to learn what CBD is and

69
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:11,000
now in the States we have CBD hemp which

70
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,009
can go across state lines so what do you

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,900
say it's the new although we yes a new

72
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:16,399
or a low but the thing is people don't

73
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,349
understand still don't understand what

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,439
CBD is because right now we're putting

75
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:25,068
CBD in toothpaste it's gonna go into

76
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:27,348
face wipes shampoo but the thing is you

77
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:29,839
see the bottle of aloe and I asked you

78
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:31,310
what does the aloe gonna do for you he

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,109
said well I think it's gonna make me

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,199
better it's gonna make this better but

81
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:37,669
do you know why and most consumers want

82
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,799
so the same thing you put CBD on a

83
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,840
bottle a consumer will not know why that

84
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,969
CBD is good for you what is it gonna do

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,219
for you well I think it's going to do

86
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,348
this but really do you want to put stuff

87
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:49,609
in your body that you think is going to

88
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:52,459
help you you really need to be educated

89
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:55,400
so that's what Europe needs to have now

90
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,169
it's the same education that we have and

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,750
their companies are coming here that are

92
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:02,299
gonna bring CBD for your pets like say

93
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,699
that CBD here is sitting here dr. Shu

94
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,639
he'll be speaking this afternoon about

95
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,709
why CBD is great for your pets so we

96
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,930
have all this education which you need

97
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,729
to bring here to bring to the mass

98
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,909
market because if you don't educate them

99
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:18,530
then it just becomes a low just becomes

100
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:21,408
lavender becomes rose it has no meaning

101
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:25,788

00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:03,049
like the make market they're going to

332
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:04,729
and this slide this talking about the

333
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:08,139
market in the States

334
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:13,550
wait till it comes here in Germany so

335
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:16,759
the flavors they're coming right we have

336
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:20,179
when we market to again for marketing to

337
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,539
segments there are segments that people

338
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,269
ignore

339
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:25,789
there's flavors in every community that

340
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:28,240
want a certain things mint well you want

341
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:32,039
mints but that's the bastardization of

342
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,610
TC but people are adding mint bubblegum

343
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,649
flavor strawberry flavors to attract a

344
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,750
crowd that doesn't like the taste of

345
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:43,199
weed but want a flavour but they want

346
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,379
the effects so as a joke this slide I

347
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,480
made is future vape pens to the future

348
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,129
because we have so many weird flavors I

349
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,830
think so next one sign coming up like

350
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,659
Cheetos or hot dog water

351
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,670
pumpkin spice because we do pumpkin

352
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,469
spice and everything all right so I got

353
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:01,349
a pumpkin spice vape pen coming soon

354
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,600
we're marketing to everybody it seems as

355
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:07,170
education does not only work by words

356
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,110
you have to touch all senses people

357
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:11,459
different communities different

358
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,500
ethnicities some people don't like

359
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,240
sweets some people don't like sour some

360
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,909
people don't like savory so we have to

361
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,700
then bring the markets down into even

362
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:23,279
finer segments of to to sell to each one

363
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,920
it's not vanilla for everybody its

364
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,990
flavor it's 32 flavors you have to

365
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,000
satisfy each market but then with each

366
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,370
market you have to have the person to

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,490
represent that market to to show to sell

368
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,919
right when it comes to cannabis in

369
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,840
Germany to education we are very focused

370
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,649
on words which you agree and I say we

371
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,389
should focus more on pictures stories

372
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,299
pictures are powerful

373
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:50,970
I can tell give you the victory kiss

374
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,679
with the sailor and a nurse right

375
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,810
already in your head you already know

376
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,449
what the image looks like I can show you

377
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,519
a picture of the I can say napalm girl

378
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,430

379

381
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,000
words I can show it to you I don't have

382
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,490
to talk to you you understand what the

383
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,809
image looks like so photography imagery

384
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:18,599
is not bound by language so images can

385
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:20,549
actually change someone's opinion yeah

386
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,069
that's what in Germany we don't have

387
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:25,470

over here we heard a lot about media

531

strategy within the last 30 minutes and

532
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:24,600
what would you say is if it comes to

533
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:28,230

535
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,420

536
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,649
British publications but is there

537
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,710
difference between in the cannabis

538
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,540
publications there are a lot of cannabis

539
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,610
publications but they go to the same

540
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:44,430
market it's already the people already

541
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:48,990

545
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,529
the new market that the magazines are

546
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,930
being sold in drugstores bookstores so

547
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:02,460
it's moving it's in the last three years

548
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,700
it's been moving into mainstream media

549

okay we'll start here and then we'll

573
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:15,329
come up to you too we got time so I've

574
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,920
heard this is this is a panel where

575
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:19,409
we're talking a lot about marketing and

576
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:23,009
we've also been talking about CBD

577
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:25,350
it is when we talk about CBD where

578
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:26,759
generally talking about low THC cannabis

579
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:28,409
because there is the rest of the

580
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:32,160
cannabinoid profile that's that's

581
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:34,980
important to be aware of my question is

582
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,840
why do you think CBD is still the term

583
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,980
that we use in marketing when it is

584
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,980
technically incorrect

585
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm not a CVD marketing expert but I

586
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:57,028
think this is also due to the lack of

587
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,319
information the industry here in Germany

588
00:26:57,028 --> 00:27:05,369
has at the moment there is no maybe we

589
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,000
somebody should have a create a new

590
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:09,000
strategy

591
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,308
or a new adding I think it's because CBD

592
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,548
is the new buzzword right CBD is in

593
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:17,730
everything CBD toothpaste CBD lotion CBD

594
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:19,500
mouthwash so people who have tried CBD

595
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,720
people who extol the virtues of CBD it's

596
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,089
become the thing so everybody no one

597
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,919
wants to buy no one knows what CPG is or

598
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,538
CBE and no one's like oh I need to sleep

599
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,639
I need a high CB enjoyment they just

600
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,470
think CBD will make me feel better and

601
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:33,089
that's the thing and so that's on us to

602
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,798
educate more people about all the

603
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:36,990
cannabinoids and different terpene

604
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,908
profiles and all those different effects

605
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,470
I think but you know how it is somebody

606
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,360
makes a pet rock and then all of a

607
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,740
sudden everybody else has another pet

608
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,178
rock or some sort of thing we'll always

609
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,149
want to jump on the hot thing

610
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,788
so CBD shoe-leather or CBD Fruit Chews

611
00:27:48,148 --> 00:27:55,288
or whatever it's it's just everywhere

612
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:59,369
and also less letters to print yeah I've

613
00:27:55,288 --> 00:28:01,259
got a short statement on here question

614
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:03,000
it's a question hey everyone my name is

615
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,908
Luke I'm an independent filmmaker

616
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,230
specialized on hemp and cannabis and I

617
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:08,760
think it's really important not to

618
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,710
forget that we're not only talking about

619
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,839
the medical aspect of this wonderful

620
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:16,019
plant but there's so much more this

621
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,778
plant can do for individuals as well at

622
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:22,230
this planet as a collective paper fuel

623
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:24,869
and so on it's not forget so asking you

624
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:28,110
guys working in media how can we spread

625
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:31,918
the holistic word about cannabis and

626
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:33,839
what are you guys doing for that first

627
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,450
of all stick to journalistic rules you

628
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,058
know this this is this is my this is my

629
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,860
main concern not to glorify it you know

630
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:42,720
stick to journalistic rules that's how

631
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:45,028
we reach the mainstream if we start

632
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Laura fiying it we will always be

633
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:50,278
considered as a kind of sect so in a way

634
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,779
I I do think stick to the journalistic

635
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:58,220
rules the rest

636
00:28:51,779 --> 00:29:03,750
happen yeah I mean I couldn't agree more

637
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:06,509
I just think it's a important that you

638
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:10,170
show every in every aspect of cannabis

639
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:12,990
consumption and this is absolutely one

640
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:18,769
aspect that we should probably emphasize

641
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:18,769
more but that for me that would be on

642
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:25,679
like not on the less important site but

643
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,500
I think if you're using medical cannabis

644
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:31,470
as a door opener then there will be

645
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:37,079
space to talk about other topics like

646
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:39,000
this as well as quickly

647
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,519
