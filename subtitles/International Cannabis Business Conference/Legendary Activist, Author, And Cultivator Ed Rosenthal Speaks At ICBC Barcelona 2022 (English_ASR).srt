we'll try it again hello everybody

28
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,920
[Applause]

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,478
isn't it great to be able to go to a

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,159
convention again

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,159
you thought that you were tired of them

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,080
right

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,880
when they ended and now you realize

34
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,879
you're addicted

35
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,839
so

36
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,559
you know

37
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,719
everything that

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,560
the government and uh the antis said

39
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,158
about cannabis

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,200
turned out

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,159
to be

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,640
the the reverse of what they said

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,640
so they said that cannabis

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,040
cannabis leads to dangerous drugs

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
and

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,719
as i see it

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,719
marijuana leads to hashish

48
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,359
but

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,359
in new york city

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,040
where marijuana is now legal to smoke

51
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,878
anywhere you can smoke a cigarette which

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,920
means you can't smoke anywhere so

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,519
but

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,079
in new york city

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,239
now if you have

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,239
a

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040
prescription for

58
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,199
opiates

59
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,639
right before it became legal and was

60
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,679
only illegal

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,759
medically

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,360
if you had a prescription for opiates

63
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:34,159
you could uh get marijuana from from it

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,160
so it turns out that opiates lead to

65
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,159
marijuana

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
and

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
that's good

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
now

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
there's only you know

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,759
i was brought in as a special speaker

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
because they realized i was going to be

72
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,560
in barcelona during

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
these conventions

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
and

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,319
they didn't really give me a subject to

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
talk about

77
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,839
but i want to talk about the most

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,479
serious subject

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,000
and that is you know

80
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,238
the people in prison all over the world

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,360
for marijuana

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,360
both here in europe

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,360
in many states in the united states

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,680
of course in asia

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,080
and in the united states while there are

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,719
people becoming billionaires

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,200
from the marijuana trade there are other

88
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,639
people languishing in prison for 20

89
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,958
years or more

90
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,199
same thing in europe and france it's

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,120
terrible the police

92
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:42,479
have seemed to be acting more violent

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,239
violently than they have in many years

94
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,439
they're trying to get their last licks

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
and i guess

96
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,359
germany there's opposition to

97
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,679
legalization

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
here in spain

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
police are acting perhaps

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
unconstitutionally

101
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,359
and

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,400
you know there are human

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
their

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,120
human suffering from that

105
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,120
and

106
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,438
we're

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
we're here at this convention it's

108
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,598
really a trade convention

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,519
and we're doing business

110
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,599
and there are people language and

111
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
languishing in prison

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
just for this

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
and so

114
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,279
i'm not going to be talking about how to

115
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,679
cultivate today you know you can buy my

116
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,959
book and learn how to cultivate

117
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,120
but what we have to learn is compassion

118
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,239
and that each of us

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,680
in the trade anybody who is making any

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,160
commerce in it

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,319

through all the different organizations

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,079
in the united states there's an

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,519
organization

127
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,319

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,440
other people have time

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,039
but it's one or the other money or time

140
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:32,319

[Applause]

145
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,240
and it's true we have to remember that

146
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,240
cannabis legalization started as a

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,519
social justice project before it was a

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
way for people to show up and try to

149
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,639
make millions of dollars being

150
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
capitalists so let's always keep the

151
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,560
spirit of social justice in the spirit

152
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,879
of freedom and the spirit of fairness in

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,240
our hearts as we do all this business

154
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,639
and with that said

155
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,439
ramos aquaman let's go have lunch man

156
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,439
