00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:21,210
I'm delighted that people from many

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,210
different aspects working and cannabis

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,670
are here I spoke to people from many

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,179
different countries many of them grow

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,429
the cannabis others try to formulate it

7
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:37,289
make it into dress or make it into

8
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:43,530
edibles and I expect that all of them

9
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:44,939
will have to sit together in disgust so

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,219
there are many problems that have to be

11
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,399
solved in the future in such meetings

12
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,420
like this one will help understanding

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,620
and then cannabis will come into the

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,429
market with a much better background in

15
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:01,429
understanding of what's going on

16
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:11,269
