27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,680
tip there SC man you uh the matches are

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
the best way of actually smoking and I

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,759
used to use the hempline all the time

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,079
but I kept going out I kept tasting the

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,759
hempwick and I was like you got to be

32
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,719
careful with the hemp line when you use

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,439
the lighter you got to use it and then

34
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,078

46

psychedelics I can hear it in your voice

B oh no it wasn't that good what no

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,958
spiritual enlightenment was found what

52
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:19,639
everybody stayed grounded what no no so

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:23,159
we started the day with I um I led um a

54
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:25,639
uh a ketamine assisted uh spiritual

55
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,159
journey for everybody but myself so I

56
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,479
was the sitter and

57
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:36,239
then I don't even think we ate breakfast

58
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:37,959
and went straight into MDMA and

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,840
LSD

60
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,800
and enjoyed the

61
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,800
snow um and

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,200
that uh I think I think carried on into

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,719
really way into the

64
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,479
night um I think we ate a meal yesterday

65
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,598
maybe

66
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:04,679
like AC bradic May she did we did eat AC

67
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:10,079
bradoock made this amazing African uh

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,959
peanut soup with prawns in it um we did

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,879
eat so that was our meal for the day but

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,840
it was

71
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,239
a it was an interesting day you know you

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,120
get a group of

73
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,319
ladies it had peanuts in it yes

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,080
interesting have you ever heard of uh

75
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,318
staying away from peanuts before an

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,719
iwaska

77
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:35,318
trip I have not well I've heard of going

78
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:38,639
vegan um before an iasa trip but not

79
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,280
peanuts no my friend Sean my friend Sean

80
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,438
got pretty into it and he was really

81
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,400
focused on the diet and he started you

82
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,639
know creating a list of foods that

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,120
should absolutely be avoided that

84
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,958
through his own bio essay and man he

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
said that the the eating of peanuts was

86
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,360
probably one of the biggest mistakes he

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,079
ever did before before an iwaska trip

88
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,200
and I guess it just you know for

89
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,400
whatever reason those particular p

90
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,959
interacted in a bad way and just caused

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,158
him uh just an excessive amount of

92
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,840
purging probably the worst thing to eat

93
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:15,879
before iasa is The Musical

94
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,358
Fruit ah The Musical

95
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:23,319
Fruit yeah oh yeah that makes sense that

96
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,359
do well isn't iasa kind of like ketamine

97
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,319
in the sense that you usually get

98
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,759
nauseous I know when I was given

99
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:33,599
ketamine I was moving so fast in my

100
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,479
brain that I got nauseous um K ketamine

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
there's a difference and and I think

102
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:39,240
everyone yesterday who took all the

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,759
other drugs as well was like ketamina is

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:49,879
very different than any drug including

105
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:53,280
iasa um iasa can tend to cause um an

106
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:57,240
evacuation either the front the back um

107
00:04:53,279 --> 00:05:01,119
and so having a diet that um uh has like

108
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,600
no Dairy and no and no meats can help

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,918
minimize

110
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:11,000
that evacuation process if you will but

111
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,719
if you're still holding on to a lot of

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,519
emotional and psychic material you're

113
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,400
going to purge or get nauseous either

114
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,799
way and I find that with ketamine

115
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:27,599
especially with my chronic pain patients

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,120
who' have been holding on to um pain and

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,080
emotional trauma on a cellular level

118
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,959
they tend to get nauseous and throw up

119
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,359
as well lot there's a lot of purging um

120
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:41,159
but yesterday thankfully nobody got

121
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,720
nauseous nobody threw up and it was a

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,880
really positive um beginning to the

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,080
start of the women's

124
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,959
retreat that's awesome that's what we

125
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,680
like to hear that's amazing and I'm I'm

126
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,079
just so glad you could pop in for a few

127
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,720
minutes yeah yeah well I'd hope that

128
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,680
like some of these other ladies would um

129
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,360
but like I said um I left them at like 2

130
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,360
in the morning um because I tapped

131
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
out well doing that many different drugs

132
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,479
I think they might be sleeping right now

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,598
considering it started off with the

134
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:18,199
ketamine and MDMA then yeah that's a

135
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:21,159
that's a robust day of psychon noting it

136
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,598
really and it was snowing so like there

137
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,800
was also like some snow trail walking

138
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:30,839
and some hot tubbing and some art making

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,759
and um it was we set pure intentions for

140
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,079
the weekend you know we started out

141
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,038
where we talked about like what we

142
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:40,560
wanted to achieve um and um we're

143
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,719
achieving

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,319
it good morning

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,280
Mark do you

146
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:53,199
consider do you consider uh Kine a true

147
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,638
psychedelic or is it just a very strong

148
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,439
depersonalization

149
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,720
drug well that's a really good question

150
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:05,598
Sam um for in the intent and purposes of

151
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:09,120
our Clinic you know um I would say that

152
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:12,319
it causes an ego death and that there in

153
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,240
lies the a property of psychedelics that

154
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,800
we can use

155
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,598
therapeutically

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,960
um I I um yeah so I think that it

157
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,519
depends on who you talk

158
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,839
to like a veterinarian probably wouldn't

159
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,120
say that oh yeah Academy and

160
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,119
psychedelic but at the aims Institute we

161
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,879
consider it

162
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,120
psychedelic it was quite PS when I used

163
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,840
it oh yeah I I remember going to a

164
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,120
psychedelic conference in Whistler that

165
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,758
had everyone it was the it was the whole

166
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,840
gamut and I think it might have been in

167
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,720
like the early 2000s or the very late

168
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,758
90s and I met a guy there who was it's a

169
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
very small community in the 90s in the

170
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,439
early 2000s the Psychedelic Community

171
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,280
was just this fraction of the Cannabis

172
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,158
community that would kind of travel

173
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,478
around and you could meet these people

174
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,478
and very easy to meet almost the entire

175
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:08,800
community at at a single one or two

176
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:11,719
events and I met a guy a real Tripper

177
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
and he he would he told me like by far

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,560
his favorite psychedelic experience was

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,279
intermuscular injections of ketamine and

180
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,759
he was literally like I leave my body I

181
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:26,559
Fly Through the Universe I can go and

182
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,120
and and visit planets I can I can go

183
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
around stars and I was just like I was

184
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,360
like holy [ __ ] dude like I thought I was

185
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,959
Hardcore with five grams of mushrooms

186
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,479
this [ __ ] is intramuscular

187
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:41,278
injecting ketamine ketamine really g a

188
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,038
separation of like especially I mean

189
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,360
some of the ladies yesterday did have

190
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:49,480
outof body experiences um some of them

191
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,200
you know who are more Psychonauts tended

192
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,039
will probably want to move forward with

193
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,640
an intramuscular just to experience that

194
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,958
real true outof Body Experience um I

195
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,278
can't say that any

196
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,119
I've done a lot of

197
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,360
psychedelics and ketamine is just very

198
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,759
different and yet and yet I would

199
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,720
consider it

200
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,919
psychedelic any uh any assistance you

201
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,480
would suggest for the come out the one

202
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,199
thing I didn't like I only did it once

203
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,000
and it was in her muscular uh Dr Lily's

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,480
Assistant gave it to me uh I hated the

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,600
come out it took so long because I guess

206
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,800
of the dosage we're given on10th of what

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,040
they give a child for uh surgery I guess

208
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,879
was what was administered is there any

209
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,879
suggestion for the come out of that

210
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:38,278
because it took so long it just was very

211
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:41,159
uncomfortable um yeah um did you take

212
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:44,078
any Zofran or any type of anti nausea

213
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,879
with it no no no no no we all got

214
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:51,559
nauseous during it and as about oh yeah

215
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:55,159
no no no you I always keep um uh so I

216
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:58,518
always keep some zofran on me um just a

217
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:01,838
dissolvable you know tablet of it um in

218
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,799
our office we give dissolvable tablets

219
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,160
and we also do in especially if

220
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,958
someone's on their journey and they and

221
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,039
they're starting to get really nauseous

222
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,839
we'll give them an injection and it

223
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,000
helps

224
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,160
[Music]

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,078
dramatically I I found that uh what

226
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:22,078
ketamine reminded me the most of was uh

227
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,078
PCP

228
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,200
it's exactly like this that and the

229
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,920
other and well I suppose it can be at

230
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,480
times but it's very much you know on its

231
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,479
own at times I think in terms of a of a

232
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,200
chemical but I agree you know my my

233
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,480
first time taking it I concur with uh

234
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,440
with Sam it was it was pretty heavy you

235
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,278
know it was like it was just too heavy

236
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,279
but the this the in the next few times

237
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:20,679
was was much more manageable because of

238
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,278
the you know just a lower dose it was

239
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:26,159
more accurate it was it

240
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,480
wasn't try this you know like it wasn't

241
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,719
because it was too strong that was not

242
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:37,240
uh I mean I've taken STP for God's sakes

243
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,600
and uh but but the the it's just a

244
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:45,240
really different High than what I

245
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:48,879
consider psychedelics you know like LSD

246
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,600
DMT uh you know uh all of these type of

247
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:55,679
drugs masculine suicide and they're

248
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,759
they're absolutely true psychedelics

249
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:04,039
without anybody's doubt whereas uh I I

250
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,559
have my doubts about uh uh ketamine I do

251
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:10,000
you think that people are

252
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,078
actually experiencing what they think

253
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,839
they're experiencing or do you think

254
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,879
it's all Just an Illusion as a result of

255
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,959
their egod depth do you have an opinion

256
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,360
I do have an opinion I think that they

257
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:26,599
really are experiencing what they're

258
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:30,199
experiencing in their mind um uh and I

259
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,920
think that it takes them into to the

260
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:36,439
other reality the other realm um

261
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:40,278
wherever that might be um and there's

262
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:45,560
enough people and studies that show that

263
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:49,439
um with that ego death that um they're

264
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,439
they're inside their unconscious

265
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,800
mind and but I hear what you're saying

266
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,159
Sam I I hear what you're saying

267
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:02,399
um if we were able in our office to use

268
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:05,879
true psychedelic you know plant medicine

269
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,559
um we would be using it and we're trying

270
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,439
but we have to start somewhere and

271
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,078
because ketamine does have psychedelic

272
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,000
properties and it does show um the

273
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:18,319
healing properties of uh for people with

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,240
trauma um and mental illness who are

275
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,040
seeking relief uh we have to start

276
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,519
somewhere so that's that's kind of our

277
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,719
Gateway into to psychedelic assisted

278
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,440
therapy on

279
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,480
I always called ketamine the Cadillac of

280
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,160
pcps well you know it's interesting I

281
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,600
hear what you guys were saying like I

282
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,799
remember in my 20s taking it at a club

283
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,159
in Miami and people were like don't

284
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:45,879
don't take too much because you don't

285
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,480
want to end up in a khole and um I

286
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,720
remember it was really heavy like I felt

287
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,560
like you know like I was my legs were

288
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,600
disconnected from the floor and um but

289
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,078
now you know as I'm older and I take it

290
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:03,240
for um like a therapeutic purpose uh I'm

291
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:08,000
actually wanting to be in that khole and

292
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,000
I I I want to go and delve into to my

293
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,920
mind so angel angel dust right Fen

294
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,758
cycline was always like sprinkled on

295
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,719
bowls or there was always the rumor

296
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,079
about you know weed that was laced with

297
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,480
Fen cycline and you like to get WETM the

298
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:28,638
late 80s yeah I I I just always I just

299
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,440
always Fred that if you look at if you

300
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,079
look at the compound itself or just the

301
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,000
structure of the compound that it's not

302
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:38,479
going to be it's not going to be

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,360
um it's not going to be thermally stable

304
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,320
and it's going to degrade right versus

305
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,639
vaporizing so the canabo when you heat

306
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,480
them up they vaporize but these things

307
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,720
contain nitrogens and when you heat up

308
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,399
compounds that contain nitrogens they

309
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,879
often degrade that's why all all the

310
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,679
psychedelics normally like the

311
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,480
phenethylamines are are are just water

312
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,319
soluble and they're they're you know

313
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,320
ingested and you don't necessarily need

314
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,000
to smoke stuff and I just remember

315
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,440
people like getting all spaced out

316
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,039
because they were sprinkling white

317
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,079
powder on their bowls and I'm like oh no

318
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:17,639
don't do that you know just didn't seem

319
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:21,078
right right yeah but you don't have to

320
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:25,759
do it that way you can turn PCP into a

321
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:28,239
base and use uh ethanol to soak it into

322
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,278
any herb yeah like like the

323
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,759
sophisticated dead heads who used to

324
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:35,879
drop so I remember ketaman on Grateful

325
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,560
Dead tour in the early 90s and I

326
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,919
remember specifically people who enjoyed

327
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,359
taking it during in the second set of

328
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,198
the Dead show there was always something

329
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,639
called drums in space and it got really

330
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,039
Spacey like they went into their

331
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,639
percussion solos and there were just

332
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,120
lights it was just really it was like

333
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,318
the most

334
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,440
psychedelically intense part of the show

335
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:00,360
and that's when people busted out Decay

336
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,360
and usually it was a um like an afrine

337
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,480
spray bottle like a a a nasal spray and

338
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,199
they take it and you'd see people like

339
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,800
like they'd be like this and then they'd

340
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:13,278
be like that and then you know what they

341
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:16,679
were doing and like C can you actually

342
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:18,759
smoke or vaporize ketamine I I don't

343
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,318
know the answer to that yeah I I don't

344
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,199
know Sam you know I just when I look at

345
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,958
the the chem so the chemical structure

346
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:29,318
of those are related so fenine and

347
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,758
ketamine are are not phenethylamines but

348
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,759
they're um so they're not like elopa and

349
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,959
they're not like amphetamines they're

350
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,519
they're actually uh uh Benzel amines and

351
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,000
they're they're different in that they

352
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,240
have just a different set of chemistry

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,919
they hit I think Allison don't they hit

354
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,120
the N ndma receptor and methyl de

355
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:52,679
aspartic acid receptor which has

356
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,159
peripheral impact on the whole central

357
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:58,278
nervous system which is why they use

358
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:01,278
these things as as animal tranquilizers

359
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:04,720
because want to say that I was young and

360
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:09,439
stupid and I'm not recommending anybody

361
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,959
smoke uh angel dust PCP uh it it I don't

362
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,120
believe there's any redeeming factor in

363
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:19,720
it whatsoever well I it's just too much

364
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,958
of a disassociative it's uh it's yeah so

365
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,318
I I I saw this news blurb where that guy

366
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,840
Marcus Rogan up in BC his little R&amp;D

367
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:32,720
thing is going to start looking at um

368
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,199
uh Vape smart like he he's he's got like

369
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,960
some kind of GC set up that they're

370
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,558
going to actually pull air through Vapes

371
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,600
to actually quantitate different types

372
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,599
of impurities and whatnot you think

373
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:48,959
they'd want to try to try that like put

374
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:51,079
little bit of PCP like on some herb burn

375
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
it or something and see like really what

376
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,599
comes off because I always thought just

377
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,158
looking at the structure I'm like man

378
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,879
those things are going to degrade as

379
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,400
soon as they heat up so all those people

380
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,480
who were smoking PCP laced weed again I

381
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,200
think it has a lot to do with the same

382
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,120
thing that people who smoke that

383
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,919
synthetic spice if you look at that

384
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,519
compound that compound unlike canono is

385
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,640
got a nitrogen in it and when those

386
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,240
nitrogen compounds heat up they

387
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,200
thermally eliminate through something

388
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,240
called a cop re um uh I'm sorry let's

389
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,000
see what is the name of that degradation

390
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,919
it's called a Hoffman degradation

391
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,720
Hoffman degradations happen with

392
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,559
nitrogen containing compounds when you

393
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,798
heat them up can't keep it from

394
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,119
happening you heat up nitrogen compounds

395
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,960
in the presence of air they degrade to

396
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:45,199
these really toxic compounds called

397
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,798
nitroso and nitrosamine compounds some

398
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,640
of the most toxic [ __ ] we know in

399
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:52,798
mankind so I mean like that that's what

400
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,080
those people were all freaked out seeing

401
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,359
Jesus on back in the day when they were

402
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:00,000
sprinkling that [ __ ] on their poles it's

403
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,000
funny because again I think they thought

404
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,839
that this wow that's really potent it's

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,640
like dude you're probably smoking all

406
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:09,519
kinds of degradation toxic degradation

407
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,120
products and not even knowing what

408
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,759
you're getting you know I I don't think

409
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,719
you can smoke it to answer your question

410
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:20,279
no clinical trials were ever done on any

411
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,120
of the Huffman compounds he he invented

412
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,839
I don't know maybe a hundred of them and

413
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,119
uh yeah that that's right but you bring

414
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,119
up a good point Sam so like I think most

415
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:35,319
of these because they're water soluble

416
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:38,558
um you could make just a uh a like a a

417
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,399
spray an internasal spray you know just

418
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,678
take a couple hits and you're good you

419
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440
know man Mark when you start with these

420
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,000
like science you know experiments so

421
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,120
early in the morning I'm like wow I just

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,880
get hey it's new out east get I love it

423
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:58,759
I have a question a whole six hours to

424
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,760
be thinking about [ __ ] man go ahead

425
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,400
you know since we're talking about

426
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,720
compounds and uh as a young buck when I

427
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,440
was really into atis Huxley and and

428
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,640
reading more about what they were up to

429
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,000
and his whole crew I read about AMT

430
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,880
right and I I took it and I read when I

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,919
read about it he described it as the

432
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,440
rollsroyce of LSD and I wanted to just

433
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,520
ask the

434
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,600
question you know Allison what what's

435
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,759
your take on that and Sam and everyone

436
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,879
in the room as a chemical what what's

437
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,720
going on there um and can anyone shed

438
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,600
any light on that if it really is the

439
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,120
Rolls-Royce I didn't hear I didn't hear

440
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,678
what compound you were talking about

441
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,678
sorry

442
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:47,159
AMT AMT not DMT no

443
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,079
AMT I'm not familiar with AMT I'm not

444
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,760
familiar with it and I thought I had

445
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,839
taken

446
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,679
everything well maybe I'm the only one

447
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,639
um it's extremely long you got the you

448
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,759
got the initials wrong or something

449
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,960
something what does it stand for

450
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:08,599
AMT Hold On Let's uh let's let's take it

451
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,159
look it up um

452
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:14,439
Google

453
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,480
yeah we're gonna

454
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,840
doch um

455
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:25,000
so alpha alpha methyl

456
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,798
tryptamine um okay it it was described

457
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,240
by Aldis Huxley as the Rolls-Royce of

458
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,918
LSD and at a time in my life life I was

459
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,759
very much learning about myself okay so

460
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,559
in what you're saying is instead of

461
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,079
dimethylamine D it's Alpha methyl

462
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,798
tryptamine no I've never heard of it

463
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:47,519
I've had some of the other tryptamines

464
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:53,679
in other words like

465
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:56,038
d yeah I've never seen a a no neither

466
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,278
have I but now I want to try it it was

467
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:00,599
very very intense and long and I I've

468
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:02,079
taken it a few more than a few times and

469
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,639
I just you know I've had a couple times

470
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,038
with a close friend of mine and you know

471
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,480
we we'd make music on this stuff and and

472
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,960
I just remember him looking at me being

473
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,798
like is this forever you know at one

474
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,798
point it was so long abnormally long

475
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:19,038
when you smoke it does it smell and

476
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:22,158
taste better than DMT which smells like

477
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,079
burning plastic or burning metal so what

478
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,520
the way that we did it you know the this

479
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,038
was not control was not controlled at

480
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,918
the time when we were getting this stuff

481
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:32,240
so we would makeing we would you know

482
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
really study the dosage and we would get

483
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,240
it and make pills out of it and take it

484
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,519
that way and the onset was a much

485
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,480
cleaner version of coming an cleaner

486
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,960
onset than I'd ever seen from any other

487
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,319
substance like this and it was a very

488
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,640
clear almost unbelievably psychedelic

489
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:53,038
experience but you're very cognitive and

490
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,480
and um you're riding that line of like

491
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,278
surrealism and you say it lasted a long

492
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,558
time because DNT oh if you smoke it it

493
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,240
doesn't last 15 minutes I mean it's

494
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:08,480
really fast right this is like huge

495
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,319
Peaks and valleys and and very expansive

496
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,599
um yeah I started to understand what AIS

497
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,079
Huxley was talking about immediately in

498
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,278
the middle of it I was like wow this

499
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:20,599
guy's really knows what's up at the time

500
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:23,400
you know it was it was really incredible

501
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,079
but um I haven't heard much about it

502
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,278
since I don't really hear people talk

503
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,798
about it I went through a phase of my

504
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:31,960
life where I was really into these

505
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,519
compounds and started there was a time

506
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,360
when you could just order this stuff I

507
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,879
mean there was a time when you could

508
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:43,199
order AMT I mean DMT and and F mayo and

509
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,919
all these other other compounds and um

510
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,038
it was a very interesting point in my

511
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,759
life but I I think it's it was just

512
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,240
curious you know it was just very

513
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:53,440
curious you know I don't really hear

514
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,919
much about it but it was um it truly was

515
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,519
like you know sitting in that

516
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,880
Rolls-Royce if you will I started to

517
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,918
understand it so if DMT is the

518
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,520
workingman Psychedelic what would you

519
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,520
call this one col it the serious

520
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,879
overtime it's just like to well it's

521
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,599
like my my buddy Dan said it was like

522
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,600
this seems abnormally

523
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:19,000
long um you know so uh that's that's all

524
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:21,678
I it was so long ago guys it was like 20

525
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,200
almost you know 15 we were able to

526
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,919
actually access time to know if it was

527
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,159
an hour two hours five hours that's the

528
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,799
thing you would be so out of T out of

529
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,039
sync with time and then you'd be you

530
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,759
know you come in and out of these Peaks

531
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,599
and valleys if you will um whatever

532
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,440
analogy we're going to use and and you

533
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:42,119
would just be like wow it's like what

534
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,960
time is it like um so that's that's what

535
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:47,119
I do remember of it but it's been quite

536
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,000
some time since I've Revisited this part

537
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,398
of my journey um but yeah that's I just

538
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,119
you know I read about it atis Huxley was

539
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:56,278
a someone I was reading a lot about at

540
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,158
the time

541
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:01,278
and um him and his crew just talked

542
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,320
about it like hey this is the rolls rice

543
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,640
of LSD and I I just that all that that

544
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,439
that analogy always stuck with me and

545
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,919
you know so that's why I asked thanks

546
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,278
for sharing I'd never heard about that

547
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,880
yeah cool sweet that's pretty

548
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:21,798
cool yeah it's in it's in tal and he

549
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,360
he's got a a prep for it so those

550
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:24,960
chemists who want to be out there and be

551
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,398
Cowboys you could actually make it if

552
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,679
you want from from tryptamine so it has

553
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:34,479
that Alpha methyl Group which is similar

554
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:37,159
to to ndma right which has got a alpha

555
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,038
methyl group too as well so well it

556
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,440
reminded me of AMT uh I mean it reminded

557
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:45,359
me of of MDMA when we when you're the

558
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,120
onset is very much like that but there's

559
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,240
all it's like it reminds me of it was

560
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,879
like this hybrid of all these things and

561
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,558
I started to understand why they were

562
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,720
talking about it in that light because

563
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,558
you're like wow the onsets amazing wow

564
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,278
this is amaz like it just like all the

565
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,200
blocks fit it wasn't like

566
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,558
um you know like when you eat mushrooms

567
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,278
your body's like what are you doing to

568
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:08,079
yourself you know there's this this

569
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:10,278
moment of this push and pull um and that

570
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:14,000
you just I never experienced that with

571
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:18,319
with this so well I always like DMT

572
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,919
because when you take a big inhalation

573
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:24,879
of it before you let it out you're

574
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,840
already on the top of the rocket going a

575
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,840
million miles an hour

576
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,079
well said tast like

577
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,639
[ __ ] well well that's my question for

578
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,640
the for the chemical question for the

579
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,480
day I I did try ketamine because when I

580
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,720
was told it was a horse tranquilizer and

581
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,319
it might help with with pain and then

582
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,880
when Allison was talking about how it

583
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,558
felt disconnected I felt like I was on

584
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,000
the floor and I couldn't move and I was

585
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:56,879
moving at like a turtle speed minus like

586
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,038
I couldn't even do anything so I thought

587
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,799
like how can I function using this in

588
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,679
life so hence hash is the go-to for me

589
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:07,558
but uh well but I would tell you use

590
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,798
smaller amounts Johnny B yeah I'm just

591
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,240
curious because everybody's been talking

592
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,398
even about what with psychedelic we

593
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:18,519
utilize we do utilize ketamine for

594
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:21,839
chronic pain in our Clinic um and we use

595
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,038
what's called like troes or lozes and I

596
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,959
usually work with them I mean of course

597
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:27,440
it's Dr Agarwal who's the one that

598
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,519
prescribes it and tells them what to

599
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,120
take um but I work with them on a weekly

600
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,200
basis to make sure that like you're on

601
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,879
the right track and we usually start

602
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,798
with a quarter of a Troy so that would

603
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,640
be like maybe 25 milligrams I'm curious

604
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:44,519
now because between Lo I've always taken

605
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,240
lots of mushrooms and then like a reset

606
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,919
but I've never done micros and I've

607
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,079
always done excessive amounts of

608
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,880
different drugs to try and see if it

609
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,720
would help me but I've never done small

610
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,320
amounts where I can't feel it so now I'm

611
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,558
kind of reassessing things by listening

612
00:27:54,319 --> 00:28:00,639
to people on clubhouse and talking here

613
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:02,960
I'm kind of in this whole new okay I I

614
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,960
take 250 milligram caps like three times

615
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,759
a day and and my my my my points are

616
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,840
getting that I'm taking too much so I'm

617
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,759
trying to like I've taken like resets on

618
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,359
days where I don't like do dabs or smoke

619
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,798
weed for the whole day now i' be doing

620
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,079
this every month and stuff like that

621
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,079
trying to find things that are going to

622
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,798
work more so I'm kind of curious about

623
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,759
this next step of being able to deal

624
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:26,038
with with chronic pain so um this is

625
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,839
great I'm gonna say can you hear me I'm

626
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,398
gonna say that if you're using plant

627
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,038
medicine and plant medicine you're able

628
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:37,759
to get it to work for you

629
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:41,240
um I would use plant medicine until you

630
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:44,319
max out on plant medicine

631
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,558
is and then like let's talk about adding

632
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:50,759
ketamine if um plant medicine no longer

633
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,480
works for

634
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:59,158
you but you have options now even with

635
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,159
um soloc can also help with pain

636
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,319
yeah was actually how

637
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,278
it I was going to welcome Josh into the

638
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,439
room I saw him just uh kind of sneak in

639
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:11,038

640

676
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,360

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,440
here and the women that are on has

678

panel are extremely committed regardless

715
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,278
of what they are committed to they're

716
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:37,398
just committed we should all be

717
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:42,079
committed in fact whether it's hash or

718
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:45,119
or marriages or relationships I love it

719
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:47,720
or my wife for n years before we tied

720
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:52,038
the old nter and uh we've been together

721
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,038
for a really long time like almost two

722
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,319
decades you have to know when you're

723
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:58,679
content right isn't that like one of the

724
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:02,319
secrets of life like really

725
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,840
separating happiness from being content

726
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:08,839
like everything in life is just a matter

727
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:11,558
of choices and so yeah and balance I've

728
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,480
been you have the choice you have the

729
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:14,558
choice of being right or being happy

730
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,558
choose

731
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:22,319
appropriately right you have to make

732
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:25,119
compromises and you if you're smart you

733
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,638
have some idea of what life is going to

734
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:34,319
be with that person in five or 10 years

735
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:37,319
I mean at least uh otherwise uh yeah in

736
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:40,278
America marriage is just another

737
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:43,240
throwaway consumer item unfortunately

738
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,480
more than half the people who marry get

739
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,638
divorced did you know people who got

740
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,558
married were one one of the partners

741
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:54,599
consumed and the other one did not and

742
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:56,519
and those marriages never lasted right

743
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,959
right I mean so really want to make a

744
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,638
bet well well so that that I'm I'm

745
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,319
asking that I guess I just about to say

746
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:09,000
the same thing that that was the that my

747
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:12,440
wife does not puff if she was to Puff

748
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,519
she would Puff CBD to go to sleep she

749
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:19,878
does not smoke that's like my

750
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:22,719
wife CBD but does not just at this age

751
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:26,679
she's not into Delta 9 or Del you know

752
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:30,358
GCA my ex let me rephrase that so like

753
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:33,878
the marriages where one was Pro and the

754
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:36,639
other was not again or or or totally

755
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,960
against so those marriages never I I

756
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,760
know several marriages where weed

757
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,679
consumption was basically the reason why

758
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,240
the marriage

759
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,358
ended my my original marriage uh which I

760
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,878
got married at the Cannabis Cup in

761
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,878
Amsterdam uh dude we were both we were

762
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,398
both proponents of cannabis but after we

763
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:58,519
were married a few years she stopped and

764
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:01,078
we grew apart and uh yeah it was a it

765
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:03,519
was a problem for us and it it didn't

766
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,000
get any better until we finally

767
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,159
divorced would be number one in that I

768
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,280
don't think we should be talking about

769
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:10,920
cannabis we should talk about how

770
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,760
alcohol ruins relationships but uh I

771
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,079
think cannabis saves relationships in my

772
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,119
opinion I agree I agree but you know

773
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,560
what I don't think I could be with

774
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:21,119
anyone who didn't use cannabis I've

775
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,400
tried and it just doesn't work doesn't

776
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,119
work well you know what's neat about

777
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,039
that is that people use cannabis

778
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,519
differently now so you can use cannabis

779
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,679
by eating essential amino acid Rich seed

780
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:33,320
oil you can wear hemp clothing you can

781
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,279
take CBD you don't have to be getting

782
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,079
high to be using cannabis so there's uh

783
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,440
you know like my wife does all three of

784
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,720
those things that I just mentioned but

785
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,039
she has no interest in in smoking

786
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:47,118
cannabis to uh alter her Consciousness

787
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,279
with THC she's not she's a little

788
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,480
sensitive to the THC but she enjoys all

789
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,880
of the other things so I guess in that

790
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,838
sense we both still enjoy you have

791
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,079
someone that supports you Marcus um but

792
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,838
when um you know like I call them like

793
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,280
um a square when like you meet a square

794
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:08,920
and they find out you you use between

795
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,280
two and five grams a day to them that is

796
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,240
like whoa whoa you got a problem Oh you

797
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,800
smoke too much or you know and that

798
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,879
doesn't work absolutely you know I was

799
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,800
talking about this recently with my wife

800
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,240
in regards to how you know we celebrate

801
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,359
our celebrations and our successes but

802
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:30,759
we don't really celebrate the Hard Road

803
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,679
and things that define us to becoming

804
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,839
who we are you know because my successes

805
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:37,039
do not Define me it's my failures it's

806
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:39,759
my difficult road that I took it's all

807
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:43,199
the bad pictures I took that create the

808
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,599
good ones that I take and so that is a

809
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,559
mentality I wish human beings had a

810
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,359
little bit more like you know like we

811
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,318
love to promote the podium and the

812
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,880
pedestal but we don't really promote the

813
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:57,759
whole difficult hard gnarly road that it

814
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,358
takes to get there and I think sometimes

815
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,440
you know manifesting you know that

816
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:05,039
experience where you're like a user and

817
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,480
the other person is not a user is all

818
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,480
part of that defining you know who you

819
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,880
are I think it's interesting that a lot

820
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,919
of us have been in long-term

821
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,920
relationships and and even like our son

822
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,680
sky and and then Sierra they've been

823
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,960
together for almost 10 years now and

824
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:26,399
they're 24 years old and uh you know I

825
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,519
just think it it it it is a good quality

826
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,880
that we have how long Wade um how long

827
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,880
have you been together with

828
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:41,119
Monica we're coming on uh 20 years now

829
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,318
um yeah I had a previous marriage with

830
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,680
the mother of my

831
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:48,960
children um and she and I have uh

832
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,318
managed to maintain being good friends

833
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
but we came to understand we just

834
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:55,960
couldn't live with each

835
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,400
other that was the mother of my children

836
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,159
um and yeah since you called me out I

837
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
wanted to jump in here and

838
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,879
say all this conversation about

839
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,400
psychedelics and all of the alphabet

840
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,480
soup of various compounds that inh

841
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,280
induced The psychodelic

842
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:18,159
Experience

843
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,359
um I I personally uh not that it really

844
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:25,039
matters but I personally only have

845
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:29,519
experienced with LSD and uh mushrooms

846
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:32,199
and Cactus and uh yeah they were all

847
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,159
quite different but the central point

848
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,480
that we keep making reference to has to

849
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,879
do with ego death and uh I would just

850
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,920
look at each of us in turn who have

851
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,358
experienced uh these psychedelics and I

852
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,200
don't think any of us have a shortage of

853
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:51,960
ego our egos are still present it's just

854
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,358
that we've come to realize that all of

855
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,519
this three-dimensional reality that we

856
00:38:54,358 --> 00:39:02,880
live in is just a construct uh

857
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:05,880
and I I really haven't imbibed in

858
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,880
psychedelics

859
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,920
in oh probably as long as I've known

860
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,480
Monica uh we actually recently sourced

861
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,519
some highquality LSD that we're

862
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:22,280
considering uh sharing that experience

863
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:24,559
together but for years I I have tried to

864
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,480
remember what the Psychedelic experience

865
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:30,719
taught me and build that exper exp

866
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,199
erience in my head through I suppose you

867
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:36,078
could call it meditation or just really

868
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,078
what I do is spend a lot of time looking

869
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,359
at nature and things that are happening

870
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,200
in the garden and around us on the farm

871
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,000
um and trying to see where I fit into

872
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,679
that and where humans fit into it and

873
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,719
how we can work together with what we

874
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:53,799
have

875
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:57,480
to um make this world a little sweeter

876
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,160
place um and so I I really want to

877
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,800
encourage and and recommend to people

878
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:06,199
who have not tried the Psychedelic

879
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,359
experience to do that to because it is

880
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,719
it's a it's a it's a dramatically quick

881
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:13,799
way to understand the

882
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:19,480
illusion that makes our world seem so

883
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:21,920
real um and uh and to recognize the true

884
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,719
essence of who you are as a human being

885
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,400
and what the opportunity for that life

886
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:31,679
is um it just seems seems important to

887
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,960
recognize that all of these all of these

888
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:37,279
drugs including psychedelics really only

889
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,760
help us Glimpse the truth they don't

890
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,880
help us live it and and you have to do

891
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,520
that work of living what's real for

892
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,318
yourself uh drugs can help us see that

893
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,639
and that's true about cannabis as well I

894
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,800
mean you know I'm I'm a missionary about

895
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:55,838
cannabis and its potential benefits for

896
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,760
humans but what's true is it's it's an

897
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,559
aid

898
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,000
uh just like in healing one of my one of

899
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:09,199
my favorite uh analogies about healing

900
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,079
is that um just like healing can happen

901
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,000
in a hospital or as a result of taking

902
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,800
some prescription drug uh what's really

903
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,880
true about healing is it comes from

904
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:24,800
within ourselves our bodies heal

905
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,480
themselves and in that same way spirit

906
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,400
Spirit can happen in a church or a

907
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,679
temple or a

908
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,639
mosque but it really comes from within

909
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:40,239
us it's our experience of spirit that is

910
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:41,920
real it's not the church itself so uh

911
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,479

in the chat just said Wade's voice just

926
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,318
lifts away all anxiety I would suspect

927
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,200
that Allison if you're using ketamine

928
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:29,119
currently to walk people through their

929
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,118
Journeys you might want to look into

930
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,519
using Wade's voice uh for some of the

931
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:38,119
integration because man that is it's all

932
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,000
just Rings true and it's all love and

933
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,480
kind someone said it the other day Wade

934
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,318
comes out and opens his mouth and just

935
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,838
showers everyone with love and and gold

936
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:49,400
nuggets and I just I just you know

937
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:51,159
that's really funny as I'm sitting here

938
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,039
I'm waiting for my coffee or whatever I

939
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:55,039
shared with one of the ladies that like

940
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,039
you know about about Wade and how

941
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,039
beautiful his words come out and and how

942
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:03,400
it's easy to be drawn because it's it's

943
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:07,358
just um everything is with love and

944
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:09,920
positivity he has a war spot sorry go

945
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:12,199
ahead he has a warmth about him when he

946
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,680
speaks but it also it comes from a well

947
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:18,358
of knowledge it isn't just spouting

948
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:20,358
anything if you can hear the wealth the

949
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:23,239
wealth of knowledge and the depth of the

950
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:25,239
person within it is uh yeah I would

951
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:29,118
recommend having him narrate anything

952
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,118
you needed to do T

953
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:35,799
to tell you the truth I patented all of

954
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,720
that knowledge so I actually own it and

955
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,480
if anybody wants to use Wade's knowledge

956
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:44,239
they have to pay me

957
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:48,400

of

980
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,838
psilocybin and I've had a few Journeys

981
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:52,679
but uh I don't go go too much past that

982
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,440
as it a few times but the micro do with

983
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:57,039
the siloc cybin really is something

984
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,358
that's proven really beneficial to me to

985
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,599
to

986
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:03,838
um you know like usually I use it when

987
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm really tired and and I don't have as

988
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:11,440
much patience Within Myself to be

989
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,400
kind um and I take the psilocybin and it

990
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,760
just gives me that empathy and that

991
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,240
understanding of kind of where I am in

992
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:24,440
the scene and so good practice it seems

993
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:28,439
to be that empathy does not lie in the

994
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,440
ego yeah

995
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:34,960

morning great AC good to hear from you

1015
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,280
how was your uh how was your psychedelic

1016
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,558
trips

1017
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,400
yesterday oh it was

1018
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,960
fantastic it was fantastic and you know

1019
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:40,240
then there's tonight

1020
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:43,119
now rinse lather repeat huh yeah well I

1021
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,879
had never done um ketamine session like

1022
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,039
that before and it was really different

1023
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,200
and it was very very interesting and we

1024
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,639
had one G who' never quite made the

1025
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,679
connection between psychedelics and uh

1026
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:58,838
medicine and healing and she made that

1027
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:58,838
connection yesterday that was awesome

1028
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,000
give thanks that's a beautiful thing and

1029
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,359
that's that's all part of the connection

1030
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,920
that we need in this time in this

1031
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,679
difficult time that often wants to

1032
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,960
connect us from the sacred and

1033
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:17,118
disconnect us from our self owered place

1034
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,159
and I

1035
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,160
think breaks that chain right just like

1036
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:26,960
the melium just like the roots just like

1037
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:29,598
fungi as a whole breaks rules there's no

1038
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,599
rules in fungi and also psychedelics

1039
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,359
follow that line so I think it's part of

1040
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:38,318
that just breaking the programming we're

1041
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:40,880
in like an everyday programming of news

1042
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,079
and food and medicine and all this stuff

1043
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,960
and and I think it takes the power of

1044
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,400
something like psychedelics and all the

1045
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,440
different forms to truly break that

1046
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,400
chain and and show us what's important

1047
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,720
which a lot of times resides in the

1048
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,400
heart

1049
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,279
and yeah absolutely my attention going

1050
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,240
in was something a little different but

1051
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,359
where it took me was all about

1052
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:05,318
connection everything you're just saying

1053
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,358
we have lost our connection to so many

1054
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:09,599
things and each other and this is a good

1055
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:13,440
way to get it

1056
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,760
back if only everyone would do it it's

1057
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,960
funny that bands work it's it's funny

1058
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,880
like bands like the Grateful Dead and

1059
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,800
and fish and some other bands have kind

1060
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,480
of figured this out that you know

1061
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,359
there's a there's different ways to get

1062
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,960
connections and plant medicines are

1063
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:31,239
definitely on the list you know the

1064
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,000
experiences I had particularly at fish

1065
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:35,159
shows certainly weren't alcohol

1066
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,880
influence they seem to be psychedelic

1067
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:40,799
influence like lots of people just not

1068
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,960
only looking to connect through the the

1069
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,519
set and setting which is the show but

1070
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,720
also that parking lot Vibe and just you

1071
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,679
know like people just looking for that

1072
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,118
so desperately I mean people followed

1073
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,960
that band around for 30 plus years for

1074
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,920
for a reason you know like not just

1075
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,318
because because there was a hole was

1076
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,838
something missing and when you go on

1077
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,798
tour I felt it myself I felt like that

1078
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,480
hole got filled I was like oh my God

1079
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:06,599
these are my people like there's so many

1080
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,880
likeminded people I can have so many

1081
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:11,760
amazing conversations and experiences

1082
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,838
and I can do it while fish is melting my

1083
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,760
brain with a beautiful split open and

1084
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:19,960
melt jam and there's all the kindness

1085
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:22,920
that surrounds it the kindness the

1086
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,679
creativity and uh just openness to to

1087
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,079
actually meet other people and and make

1088
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:29,000
those kinds of connections

1089
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,680
and for us who didn't have access to the

1090
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,239
drugs or the scenes I mean we heard

1091
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,318
about the scene and that's what drove me

1092
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:37,519
to shake down street was dude they've

1093
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:39,318
got every drug available there's people

1094
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,838
walk around with mushrooms and I'll be

1095
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,519
damned if some guy isn't walk around

1096
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:46,279
with a 25 gram amonita going mushrooms

1097
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:48,519
mushrooms you

1098
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,640
know don't forget

1099
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:53,440
your Bo balls with armpit hairs in them

1100
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:57,199
oh

1101
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,440
yeah and your Guatemalan short and your

1102
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,519
tie-dye

1103
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,639
t-shirts and your your jewelry and yeah

1104
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,838
just anything that you need to look like

1105
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,838
a

1106
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:13,039
hippie it was

1107
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,400
great people I started at the age of 14

1108
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:17,759
seeing those guys and it was just yeah I

1109
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,760
was like whoa you know and living in

1110
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,280
northern New Jersey it was easy growing

1111
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,799
up in the late 70s early 80s to go see

1112
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,200
the Grateful Dead by just traveling like

1113
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:29,199
a 2hour

1114
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,558
circled and around New York City you

1115
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:35,118
could literally see hundreds of shows

1116
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,280
and not have to travel too far but there

1117
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,119
was like a spirit of Adventure because

1118
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,160
you didn't always have tickets right and

1119
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,720
you're like driving and it was before

1120
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:47,318
cell phone so you're unable to hook up

1121
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:50,118
with people until you got there and

1122
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:52,639
unlike today it wasn't broadcasted to

1123
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:54,640
the world so to be there to witness the

1124
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:57,078
magic you had to be in the building you

1125
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:59,798
needed a piece of a little ticket that

1126
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:01,720
got you into the building and if you're

1127
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:04,599
lucky like with dead and Mark will

1128
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:07,639
remember with fish you actually got a

1129
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,760
tape of the show like the next day and

1130
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:13,239
you're listening to the show that you

1131
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,720
just saw that just blew your mind and

1132
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:18,679
now you have it on tape for the rest of

1133
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:22,639
your life it was it was just such an

1134
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:26,279
incredible adventure to to live and and

1135
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:28,598
um fish had this incredible uh Crescendo

1136
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,920
after Garcia died in '95 I think they

1137
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:33,519
were certainly The Heirs app parent for

1138
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,838
like the next Traveling Circus the next

1139
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,199
large traveling circus they already had

1140
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,838
an incredible body of music and they

1141
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:42,879
were being incredibly creative at the

1142
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:45,279
time and just like the dead they weren't

1143
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,039
the commercial success but they let

1144
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,359
people tour and they let people tape and

1145
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,318
that whole Shakedown Street like when

1146
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:54,159
the fish show rolled into town it was

1147
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,838
just like the dead they needed to give

1148
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,239
them their own parking lot there were

1149
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:00,880
campers there were tpps there were just

1150
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:03,078
all kinds of just this traveling circus

1151
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,200
that would travel around and that was

1152
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:07,880
part of the culture of the music and you

1153
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,358
hit it on the head Marcus it was really

1154
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,358
unique because if you went to like I

1155
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:14,519
don't know like a Almond Brothers show

1156
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:17,279
or or Neil Young there was never a

1157
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:20,318
traveling circus associated with any

1158
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,599
other band I mean I guess on the jam

1159
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:25,480
band maybe at a much lower level some of

1160
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:27,480
the Bands had it but you know fish had

1161
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,079
this sort of crescend all the way up to

1162
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,199
the Millennium and when they played

1163
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:34,960
their show at Big Cypress in the

1164
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:36,960
Everglades it was the largest gathering

1165
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,400
on the planet for the Millennium the

1166
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,440
largest gathering was the fish show that

1167
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,599
I was at along with my lovely wife a

1168
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,519
bunch of my friends and it was just it

1169
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:49,119
was incredible because they played from

1170
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:53,199
Midnight all throughout the night all

1171
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:56,960
seven and a half hours yeah how many

1172
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:59,960
people I think um was like 85 th000

1173
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,679
people Marcus I I can't remember it was

1174
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,760
a big one I I wasn't at seol but I had

1175
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:07,598
Bubble Bags there and I had friends

1176
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,559
there and Marcel brought the fish 2000

1177
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,838
bubbler there which was like at the time

1178
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:15,519
a $10,000 pipe that he like literally

1179
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:17,358
said he lit and he passed and then he

1180
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,000
didn't see it for hours and he would

1181
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:21,598
just catch glimpses of it moving around

1182
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,119
the place and then at the end of the day

1183
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:27,240
at night it kind of came back to him but

1184
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:30,838
that crosseyed and painless

1185
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:33,199
that they did oh my God man that crossy

1186
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:35,838
and painless from seal Indian

1187
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,759
Reservation big Cyprus was uh pretty

1188
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:40,159
much my favorite version of that song it

1189
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,520
just incredible to witness the sun the

1190
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,798
sun coming up that day Marcus was just

1191
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:48,358
incredible it's like velvet sea was

1192
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:50,480
right at Sunrise and you know you're

1193
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,239
just there and you're spent but you're

1194
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,159
you're in this new you know Millennium

1195
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:56,798
and remember everyone thought like

1196
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:59,759
computers were going to take over the

1197
00:53:56,798 --> 00:54:02,480
world or computers were going to crash

1198
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,040
or something but um there's actually a

1199
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,679
famous YouTube or clip Up on YouTube

1200
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,519
that

1201
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:13,039
shows Peter Jennings who was uh I guess

1202
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:15,759
hosting ABC's uh rocking the Millennium

1203
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:19,558
New Years and they actually cut to fish

1204
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,559
and they do heavy things and um yeah it

1205
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,839
just it was really surreal to be there

1206
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,720
but the reason why I was mentioning that

1207
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:27,199
is it seemed like that was kind of like

1208
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:30,279
a crescendo that was hit and then after

1209
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:32,199
that it was just like H like what do we

1210
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,760
do like what could we do that would

1211
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:38,598
possibly top that like

1212
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,920
they Davis after he wrote Sketches of

1213
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:43,798
Spain you know like musically it was

1214
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,079
like the Pinnacle for him like you just

1215
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:46,599
where do you go next he was like where

1216
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:48,039
do I go from here you know what I mean

1217
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:50,720
but then he came back and ripped [ __ ]

1218
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:52,639
Brew at 42 years old and changed again

1219
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:53,399
change music change the world in which

1220
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,960
we

1221
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,079
perceive you know GR

1222
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,559
and and and playing a 100,000 person

1223
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:07,318
event in 1973 at Watkins Glenn in New

1224
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:09,319
Jersey like after 1973 you'd think oh

1225
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:10,519
[ __ ] how are we going to go bigger than

1226
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:14,679
that and next thing you know you make

1227
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:16,838
the wall of sound which is 89,000 watt

1228
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:20,480
uh you know system with every single

1229
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:22,920
string on its own channel and Oley just

1230
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,719
coming out of jail to create the largest

1231
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,000
sound system that's ever been known to

1232
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,838
mankind so I'm pretty sure humans are uh

1233
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,318
you know capable of creating the new

1234
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:35,000
best thing and uh I know I'm just

1235
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:37,880
thankful for that creativity I want also

1236
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,838
to add to the the Psychedelic lore that

1237
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:44,079
barter fairs were really important back

1238
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:47,880
in the day when I think to that year

1239
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:51,720
1974 which I call buttery buttery soft

1240
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:55,000
Grateful Dead is like 74 to 76 it was so

1241
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:57,399
good it was they sounded so great they

1242
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,239
were so on their game really you think

1243
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,880
we could create that again now I mean

1244
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:06,318
even when you listen to all of the music

1245
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,119
back then Steely Dan all the mtown all

1246
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:12,759
the R&amp;B stuff that was happening in the

1247
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:15,000
70s dude the 70s will never be able to I

1248
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,640
I don't think music will ever be like

1249
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,079
that again ever again it'll be

1250
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:25,078
different George Clinton in the

1251
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:28,318
7s it seemed to just get distorted to

1252
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:31,000
the point where now somebody you know

1253
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:33,318
doesn't do a studio release or a record

1254
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,400
they do some recording on Tik Tok and

1255
00:56:33,318 --> 00:56:38,079
next thing you know they're the next you

1256
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,760
know International sensation I mean I

1257
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,720
think what we witnessed in like the 70s

1258
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,440
and the 80s I mean that groovy music

1259
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:48,399
when you go back and listen to that I

1260
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,358
mean all that great good Steely Dan and

1261
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,280
all that great stuff even like through

1262
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:55,759
the 80s with like bands like Los Lobos I

1263
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,920
mean we'll never see that level of

1264
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,920
creativ ity and really goodness in music

1265
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,480
again I well that's what they said about

1266
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,358
Sabbath and Zeppelin and the Beatles and

1267
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,199
the stones and all these incredible

1268
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:11,598
bands but the bottom line is is we will

1269
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:15,639
it's a guarantee if you want to be like

1270
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:18,119
musically blown away like truly like not

1271
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:19,719
not so much the music but lyrics like

1272
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:21,640
I've been tripping on this guy Harry

1273
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:24,439
Mack lately I can't even say enough

1274
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:26,639
about him this guy does live freestyles

1275
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,400
he writes entire songs from the top of

1276
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:31,279
his head in an instant with three words

1277
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,798
that given to get get given to him and

1278
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,200
he's doing it on YouTube he's doing it

1279
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,679
on omegal it's very very different from

1280
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,358
what you're talking about but it goes to

1281
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:40,919
show that there are things that have

1282
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:43,318
never existed that are just starting to

1283
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,960
exist and if that can exist then

1284
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:48,558
something else can exist you know in the

1285
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,039
future and I I'm I have faith that human

1286
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,359
beings are only going to get tastier and

1287
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,240
better and I mean when I saw this young

1288
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,838
rock band that came out I'm probably

1289
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:00,239
going to forget their name but they

1290
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:02,239
sounded so much like Zeppelin and Rush

1291
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,679
have you heard these these young kids I

1292
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,838
can't remember talk and then also like

1293
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:09,519
uh Kevin Parker from uh Tam and Paulo

1294
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:11,759
that kid's a a killer songwriter I mean

1295
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,719
you know it's newer but I mean he's got

1296
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,920
a lot of creativity with his guitar

1297
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:19,000
pedals and he's a baller I mean he he

1298
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,680
knows what he's doing and you know I

1299
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,239
agree I think music and different ways

1300
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:24,639
is going to reshape the future and look

1301
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:26,439
the you know we were touching about the

1302
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,759
wall of sound I mean think about it I

1303
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,599
don't know if many people realize this

1304
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,240
like the reason we have noise cancelling

1305
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,200
microphones is literally because of the

1306
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:37,000
wall of sound like we like in terms of

1307
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:39,000
live music the wall of sound was the

1308
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,119
beginning of where we're at like that

1309
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,798
was live they the they were the first

1310
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,640
band to really think about the live

1311
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:48,960
experience in terms of why don't what do

1312
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:51,199
I experience in the studio is not being

1313
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,159
experienced to the crowd and how do we

1314
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,199
translate that and the wall sound really

1315
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:58,358
took those ideologies and they they used

1316
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,000
brains and their their passion to get

1317
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:03,318
get us where we're at today with

1318
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,079
festivals I mean before we had any of

1319
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:06,599
this stuff we had just terrible sound

1320
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:09,720
and I don't I don't you know we don't

1321
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:12,359
realize that said Colin that was due to

1322
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:13,798
ousley I know but but again but it was

1323
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:16,400
working with the band you know what I

1324
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:19,318
mean like and then working with um

1325
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Macintosh in Upstate New York to to

1326
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:24,920
actually design the drivers to to

1327
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:28,559
amplify everything correctly I mean it's

1328
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:31,760
incredible entire creation of selling

1329
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:34,960
the whole entire population LSD on top

1330
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,400
of it all really helps serious well and

1331
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,480
a steal yourf Face logo as well as the

1332
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,318
buckles because the first thing he tried

1333
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,000
to do is sell me a buckle when I met him

1334
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:45,519
he's like hey you want to buckle of

1335
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,039
course that but you know there's still

1336
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:50,798
musical Geniuses out there I mean go

1337
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:53,880
check out this piano player uh haromi I

1338
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:57,079
mean she is absolutely amazing as you

1339
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:59,119
know there's prodigies and those amazing

1340
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:02,200
you know jazz players that are still

1341
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,200
Rising with each generation so you know

1342
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:06,118
it's also about staying plugged in and

1343
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:07,919
looking and listening because I think

1344
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,838
what is it the average person stops

1345
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,000
listening to new music at the age of 32

1346
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:15,038
so you know you have to always be you

1347
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,760
know reaching out I know it sounds weird

1348
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,799
but that's a if you go look at

1349
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,119
Psychology a lot of people cut off their

1350
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,880
music around

1351
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:26,000
3233 and everything below that for their

1352
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,720
Generations they listen to so it's just

1353
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,679
you know it's also about plugging in and

1354
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:31,838
checking in because there's still

1355
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:33,279
amazing musicianship out there that will

1356
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:37,119
raise the level we're starting to see

1357
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:39,920
rock music just starting to make a so

1358
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:43,000
step by step that was Greta Greta Van

1359
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,000
fleet was the band's name yeah Greta and

1360
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,199
they're dude those kids RI I mean and

1361
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,400
while we're on the topic of jazz we lost

1362
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:53,960
an absolute Visionary uh this past week

1363
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:57,160
um chick Korea chick um I mean you want

1364
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,480
to talk about an innovator this guy

1365
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:01,519
was the first person to take an electric

1366
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,240
piano with Herby Hancock and really

1367
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:06,719
incorporate that into jazz I mean that's

1368
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,959
that's a sounds like a small feat but

1369
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:12,519
that's literally like Dylan plugging his

1370
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,318
guitar in for the first time yeah haromi

1371
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:17,400
haromi did a jam with actual chick Korea

1372
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:20,279
that's awesome man yeah chick is a major

1373
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,599
inspiration to me and um we lost a

1374
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,319
legend I mean but what will be like that

1375
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:25,960
again you know like that that's what I'm

1376
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,920
kind of like if you look at the ch

1377
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:32,519
change in popular music that happened in

1378
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,639
the three decades between the 1930s and

1379
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:36,119
the

1380
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:38,920
1960s and then you look at like the

1381
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:41,720
three decades like that have unfolded

1382
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:44,240
since today there's hardly any change

1383
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:47,000
right and and I'll agree with what ATN

1384
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:49,919
said is that there are incredibly

1385
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,519
talented musicians out there one of my

1386
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,278
current favorites right now is none

1387
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:57,759
other than William apostel AKA Billy

1388
01:01:54,278 --> 01:02:00,440
strings Billy string is just you know

1389
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,200
Doc Watson reincarnated Doc Watson and

1390
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,119
Clarence white reincarnated and if you

1391
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:08,318
don't know who those people are look him

1392
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:11,278
up again he is a true Bluegrass player

1393
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:13,719
through and through but can shred

1394
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:16,599
anything and he's just an incredible

1395
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:18,838
talent but it's Bill Monroe blueglass

1396
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:21,318
which you know was invented back in the

1397
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:23,159
you know 30s and 40 so I'm just

1398
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:26,079
wondering like what's next what's the

1399
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:27,960
next big thing that's GNA AR well

1400
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,160
they're talking about Zappa in the chat

1401
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:33,559
room you know there's Zappa's long gone

1402
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:36,199
yet I seen dzel Zappa play Zappa Zappa

1403
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:39,880
play Zappa a few years ago and that [ __ ]

1404
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:42,078
tore my head off I sat in the front row

1405
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:44,599
absolutely flabbergasted at the quality

1406
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,039
of his ability to play the guitar but

1407
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:51,079
also the ability to pull people from

1408
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:54,359
Frank's groups into his group and and

1409
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:57,760
just everything was so so on point that

1410
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:59,838
uh I have an appreciation for that

1411
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,559
FR Zappa movie that's out there right

1422
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:32,200
record in existence that's been recorded

1423
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:35,278
if they were in any major Studio his you

1424
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:37,318
know the the the ne console was a a

1425
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:41,000
mixing board that had very specific

1426
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:42,798
components that allowed a very Dynamic

1427
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,880
richness to be captured from through

1428
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:47,559
microphones and um you know that was he

1429
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,358
was a major contributor behind the

1430
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:53,000
curtain to a lot of our our the favorite

1431
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:56,358
records that we all listen to yeah the

1432
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,760
first wall of sound was actually put

1433
01:03:56,358 --> 01:04:01,239
together in studios by Phil Spectre oh

1434
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,319
no way that's interesting I didn't

1435
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:06,919
realize that oh Phil Spectre who just

1436

together on the Riverboat president on

1450
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:43,358
the same guitar that was a when was a

1451
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,719
short neck the other was a long neck and

1452
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:49,798
they ripped that [ __ ] apart man the

1453
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:52,000
whole place was just jaw dropped

1454
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:55,719
everywhere wow I was gonna say a lot a

1455
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,920
lot of it is access and and access to to

1456
01:04:55,719 --> 01:05:01,078
media and access to create media it's

1457
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:05,119
totally changed from from the era of the

1458
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:09,160
70s and the 80s and even the 90s where

1459
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:11,798
every iPhone and and iPad you get has a

1460
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,759
sound engineer system in it you know

1461
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:17,960
Garage Band we could all create [ __ ]

1462
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,480
epic music right now right there and and

1463
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,079
then we can also put it out really easy

1464
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,760
with a couple clicks I could put it on

1465
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:26,240
iTunes and it's available and and that

1466
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,319
has like spread out the interest and

1467
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:30,000
who's listening to what and so I I think

1468
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,558
a lot more people are listening to a lot

1469
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,199
more diverse music and there's a lot of

1470
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,599
people kicking ass right now and it's

1471
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:37,798
really interesting and there's a lot of

1472
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:40,519
influences that are being melded

1473
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:41,719
and man I just you know that's just kind

1474
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,838
of what I was thinking when I was here

1475
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:44,159
and all that and like because I listen

1476
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:46,358
to all the great stuff too in high

1477
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,480
school I was listening to the the 70s

1478
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:50,119
bands and [ __ ] rocking out and

1479
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,039
thinking man there's that that was the

1480
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:54,039
era of music you know people were really

1481
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:56,599
meld in sound and the guitars were

1482
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:58,640
ripping and and that's what we kind of

1483
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:00,079
modeled our music after but then it it

1484
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,000
changed you know because we had

1485
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:06,240
influence from the stuff of our time you

1486
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,719
know and well music has changed yeah the

1487
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:09,838
stuff that's coming out right now I kind

1488
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:11,959
of think is mimicking the 80s the synth

1489
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:14,440
80s stuff and I I kind of love it you

1490
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,079
know but it's meddled with hip hop and

1491
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,838
and beats that are different than than

1492
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,519
we had in the 80s you know that's really

1493
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:22,719
cool you got people being exposed to

1494
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:25,358
music that weren't being exposed to

1495
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:28,598
music so YouTube has this entire culture

1496
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:31,000
of reaction videos where you have people

1497
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:32,920

1525
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:34,880
doesn't start till midnight and uh you

1526
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,440
know the guy's name is Frank Zappa I was

1527
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,119
like I don't even know who that is I

1528
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,400
really didn't even know who Frank Zappa

1529
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:42,760
was in 1988 you know I didn't know who

1530
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,358
he was so I went into this little

1531
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:48,760
underground bar and they were handing

1532
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,558
everybody fans at the at the door so

1533
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,640
like some of them were really beautiful

1534
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,079
fans some of them were paper fans and

1535
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:57,879
they were handing out fans and then when

1536
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:00,480
we went in Frank Zappa came out onto the

1537
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:05,278
stage and he said all my

1538
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,920
fans I love all my fans look at all my

1539
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:09,400
beautiful

1540
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,278
fans and then he continued to rock the

1541
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,160
house down for a 50 person show I think

1542
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:16,479
unbelievable I really think that fish

1543
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:19,000
needs to have a permanent picture of

1544
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,599
Frank Zappa on their stage on every

1545
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,279
single show that they play because

1546
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:27,560
without Frank Zappa you know fish is

1547
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:29,759
unique but wow they always prop out

1548
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,600
Frank I mean Peaches on regalia that's

1549
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:35,158
their Ode to Frank and they Crush I I

1550
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:38,239
suspect if Frank ever saw them play that

1551
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:40,000
he would be like he'd be impressed hey

1552
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:42,119
Sam weren't you weren't you Frank

1553
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,640
Frank's neighbor at one point

1554
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:51,880
Sam yeah for several years in Laurel

1555
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:56,480
Canyon uh and I I dated uh dzel uh

1556
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:59,719
babysitter Christina from hot rat

1557
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:02,158
in the swimming pool Frank was the only

1558
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:04,640
one allowed to even jam with like Pink

1559
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,238
Floyd they wouldn't jam with anybody but

1560
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:11,679
they would let Frank come up and jam

1561
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:16,358
with him well I've also heard uh Frank

1562
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:20,838
play cover songs of like Jimmy Hendrick

1563
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:25,079
or or Eric Clapton and Frank can just

1564
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:28,318
run circles around I mean Frank was a

1565
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:31,759
gen guitar player with without a doubt

1566
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:35,080
I've been to about maybe 50 of Frank's

1567
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:39,158
concerts at about uh maybe a similar

1568
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:41,838
number of uh him just practicing he was

1569
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:44,198
a true composer he was a true composers

1570
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:46,238
composing no he he was a musical genius

1571
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:49,119
with you know what it's hard to mention

1572
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:51,519
Frank without mentioning Sun raw who was

1573
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,838
another musical composer and if if you

1574
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,840
don't know who Sun raw is I really you

1575
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:58,399
know space is the place is his

1576
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,960
autobiography which is absolutely

1577
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,639
spectacular and he has quite a few

1578
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:05,198
stories about Frank in that book um yeah

1579
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,840
Sun RW spases the place so is that sort

1580
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:12,000
of psychedelic Punk oh yeah it's

1581
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,520
important big big Steve Parish Big Steve

1582
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,760
Parish who for many years was Jerry

1583
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:20,880
Garcia's roie has got a show on XM

1584
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,440
called Big Steve hour and just last week

1585
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:26,400
he was recalling uh a caller called in

1586
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:29,519
and asked why the Dead never played with

1587
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:32,920
Zappa and and big Steve basically said

1588
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,760
the reason why uh Zappa didn't like the

1589
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:38,960
Greatful de is because Zappa hated

1590
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:41,440
cannabis yeah he hated Dr a lot of drugs

1591
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,640
cannabis having to deal with music and

1592
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:45,439
rock and roll and the fact that all rock

1593
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,800
and roll musicians were kind of

1594
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:50,599
categorized as Stoners he said the

1595
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:52,520
reason why he didn't come around us any

1596
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,520
because he couldn't deal with the level

1597
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,880
of cannabis use and when they did come

1598
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:00,640
together he was a total not social you

1599
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:04,640
know kind of [ __ ] well he did like

1600
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:08,159
two drugs he liked nicotine and

1601
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:11,119
caffeine yeah but and

1602
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,839
sex yeah yeah but he hated cannabis and

1603
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:15,920
his cannabis use is well do or his K

1604
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,199
hatred for cannabis use is well

1605
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,000
documented it's it talked about in in

1606
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:22,359
space as the place as well they talk

1607
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,479
about it in the autobiography that uh

1608
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:28,839
because people who played with sun raw

1609
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:31,439
also played with um Frank and they had

1610
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:34,640
strict rules to not hang out with not

1611
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:37,158
just the Grateful Dead But a huge amount

1612
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,000
of people and groups and musicians that

1613
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:42,079
were doing all sorts of drugs because

1614
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,158
yeah FR it it it altered his you know he

1615
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,079
he was an OCD genius that wanted

1616
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:47,719
everyone to be doing kind of you know

1617
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,800
composing what they wanted and they were

1618
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:53,119
tripping balls on acid it wasn't uh it

1619
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,639
wasn't coming together for him I guess

1620
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:58,000
Zappa reminds me of like a more

1621
01:11:54,639 --> 01:12:00,760
accessible John M glin um I always kind

1622
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,960
of associated their work very similar

1623
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:06,880
but he was just more accessible and was

1624
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:08,279
more together in terms of the way he put

1625
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,239
I was just gonna add the only thing

1626
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:12,639
about the movie that I found a little

1627
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:15,198
disappointing was you know there were so

1628
01:12:12,639 --> 01:12:17,159
many players in and out of the mothers

1629
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:20,319
especially in the earlier years that

1630
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:21,960
were [ __ ] incredible LOL George got

1631
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,840
kicked out of the mothers because of his

1632
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,520
drug use I mean he went on and made

1633
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:30,039
little feet uh you know there's just the

1634
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:33,320
the the list is endless of musicians

1635
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:35,800
that were around Frank Zappa that re

1636
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:39,000
don't forget Jimmy Carl Black he's the

1637
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,000
Indian of the

1638
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:45,119
group and how about a shout out for Bill

1639
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:46,719

1640
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,719

1641
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,719
thousands of recordings when you

1642
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,319

1648
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:08,840
was involved in the downtown scene a bit

1649
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,560
um and I I you know those guy like I

1650
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:13,079
think Bill lives in San Francisco now

01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,560
and he's still doing shows um much

1652
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:18,119
smaller settings but yeah an incredible

1653
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:20,080
player and someone that's inspired

1654
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:21,599
myself and I know that he's really moved

1655
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:23,840
music forward in terms of what you're

1656
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,880
saying Mark through the 90s I think he

1657
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,600
held the torch in terms of experimental

1658
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:32,840
stuff yeah well who takes a Miles Davis

1659

Freedom ambient translations of Bob

1669
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:04,399
Marley and dub Robbie shangar yeah I was

1670
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,079
saying Robbie shangar he he was one that

1671
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:09,039
was not okay with cannabis smoking he

1672
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:11,119
wasn't okay with drugs and was

1673
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:13,039
influencing the culture but but he

1674
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,039
decided that he was going to just open

1675
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:18,119
himself up to it because there was a

1676
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:20,319
dream and also he had a Healer who he

1677
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:22,800
had been working with his whole life

1678
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,519
ever since he was a child and the Healer

1679
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,800
had told him you know I do think that

1680
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:30,080
you need to open up your music you know

1681
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:33,039
for him and and open up your arms to

1682
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:36,359
this and I think that because he did

1683
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:39,479
that it really made his music so much

1684
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:43,479
better so much more Rich well and he he

1685
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:47,359
gave he gave us he gave music an

1686
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:49,759
Incredible Gift right Nora Jones is his

1687
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:52,279

1688
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:55,520

1690
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,719
unbelievable and how about I how about

1691
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:02,679
we shout outad alahaka Hussein if we're

1692
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:05,760
going to shout out Ravi Shankar and his

1693
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:08,920
son Zakir Hussein who is probably one of

1694
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,320
the greatest players of the TAA to ever

1695
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,679
walk the face of the Earth that man

1696
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:16,840
brought me to tears at several concerts

1697
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:19,800
that I've recorded of of uh I saw him

1698
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,960
with the Grateful Dead back in the day I

1699
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,440
just yeah their music really changed for

1700
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:27,480
the better I I believe it became so much

1701
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:31,479
more world and so much more palatable

1702
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:33,919
when cannabis became sort of part of you

1703
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:36,079
know the tuning of it and and he even

1704
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,158
talks about it sort of intimately in an

1705
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:42,279
interview of how against drugs he is and

1706
01:15:39,158 --> 01:15:44,719
how he does feel like playing with other

1707
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:47,639
people under the influence did help his

1708
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:50,760
music did help him actually he says

1709
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:53,639
reach Shiva in a different way so that's

1710
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:56,039
pretty interesting he was open like that

1711
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:57,719
I would just add the opposite end of the

1712
01:15:56,039 --> 01:16:00,238
spectrum and just give a lot of love to

1713
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:03,039
George Clinton and the P Funk Allstars

1714
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:08,479
and Funkadelic and their whole influence

1715
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:12,319
on the culture and spoken words Bo booty

1716
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:14,959
Bo booty came from that traditional

1717
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:17,399
James Brown style and then just blew the

1718
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,319
top off with George Clinton so like by

1719
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:22,799
the time we saw George Clinton in the

1720
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:27,519
mid early 90s I mean that was five to

1721
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:30,880
six hours straight no breaks total

1722
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,960
Church you know just Rhythm down to the

1723
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,359
core and and if it weren't for LSD it

1724
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,840
would be really hard to go to one of

1725
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:38,839
those shows I remember seeing him come

1726
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,920
out on stage with a cape that just said

1727
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,719

cannabis regulations and you know I

1738
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,560
don't think so equality we we're working

1739
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,440

realized well I can't do that again

1784
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:00,479
because um that's when people turn off

1785
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,960
the playlist but

1786
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:05,319
uh that's when some people turn on the

1787
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:08,399
playlist that's a dark star that dark

1788
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:09,759
star is too short I like alligator I put

1789
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:12,519
alligator on there because that's the

1790
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,960
ultimate um LSD recording you know like

1791
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,719
that's the one where they were just so

1792
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,639
high on every drug possible they're like

1793
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:21,920
let us in the studio you know I love

1794
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:24,239
that one like Viola Lee Blues from back

1795
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,319
in the day too a good old Viola Lee

1796
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,399
Blues where they hit that drop at the

1797
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:30,000
end they just get right back in the room

1798
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:33,519
it's just

1799
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,719
like do you guys listen to the uh XM

1800
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,000
channel The Grateful Dead channel on XM

1801
01:19:35,719 --> 01:19:40,319
they have today in Grateful Dead history

1802
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,158
well um the last couple days they've

1803
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:48,039
been playing the shows from the Filmore

1804
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:52,559
East uh February uh uh uh 11th 12th 13

1805
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:55,399
14th New York City uh 1970 you know and

1806
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,560
I've had these on cassette tapes since I

1807
01:19:55,399 --> 01:20:01,638
was probably a sophomore in high school

1808
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,639
so I'm going back to

1809
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:09,840
1970 I don't know eight is so oh my God

1810
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:12,840
to hear those in such great sound

1811
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,119
quality is just unbelievable and the

1812
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,319
almonds came out during uh I think it

1813
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,319
was love light or something like that

1814
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:21,238
and you could hear Greg almond singing

1815
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:23,000
because Greg almond takes the mic and

1816
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:25,158
you could totally make out Dwayne's

1817
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,079
playing because Dwayne just sounds

1818
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:29,759
different than Garcia it's just not

1819
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:33,000
Garcia at all I mean I've been listening

1820
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,320
to this piece of music for isn't where

1821
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,158
the almonds really got influenced by the

1822
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:40,599
dead to really go into shred yeah I feel

1823
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:42,238
like that was the show well they always

1824
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,760
had they had the two drummer thing going

1825
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:47,479
on too and I think both of those bands

1826
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:49,079
mutually influenced each other but if

1827
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:51,678
you think about that it was such a

1828
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:54,039
magical period for the dead because they

1829
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:57,279
were just about to go into the uh uh

1830
01:20:54,039 --> 01:20:58,880
studio and record uh work in Man's dead

1831
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:00,880
then you know later on in the year they

1832
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,159
get busted in New Orleans and so now

1833
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,560
they got to you know quickly put

1834
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:08,638
American Beauty together so those two

1835
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,520
albums came out in 1970 you know and I

1836
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:13,600
was only eight years old when they came

1837
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,400
out but um I was on tour you know just a

1838
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,360
handful of years later and it was just

1839
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:22,439
it was oh my God so so magical there

1840
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:25,920
were so 1972 Vanita um Oregon Country

1841
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:28,559

1846
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:42,159

1847
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:45,399

1848
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:48,799
in our yogurt back in the early 70s and

1849
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:52,198
then to have 20,000 people show up at

1850
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,199
the Oregon Country Fair lot 1972 minimal

1851
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:56,319
cars in the parking lot because most

1852
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:59,359
people came in and school buses are

1853
01:21:56,319 --> 01:22:01,198
hitchhiked and it was like 110 degrees

01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:03,319
out well that was during the gas lines

1855
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,839

1856
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:09,000

Daydream is is the name of the show yeah

1858
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,479

on Amazon or something you could watch

1860

people that took their power back and

1895
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:50,039
had home births they created a whole

1896
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:52,399
line of buses and school buses that went

1897
01:23:50,039 --> 01:23:54,560
around the country and then they finally

1898
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:58,079
settled in Tennessee and created a a

1899
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:02,480
thing called the farm and the farm still

1900
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:04,279
functions to this day as a let's say A

1901
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:07,319
Women and Children's Health Clinic along

1902
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:11,039
with educational Outreach for

1903
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:13,799
midwives andal healing we're not talking

1904
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:16,000
about the seven tribes buses are we

1905
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,600
those crazy brown and white buses

1906
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,238
extremely different the 12 tribes was

1907
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,679
the the group that got the people that

1908
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:25,638
were too high that was Joshua and then

1909
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:29,158
they they they comforted them with Jesus

1910
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:32,679
and and Christianity and food right

1911
01:24:29,158 --> 01:24:36,399
the and I have to say I pulled I pulled

1912
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:40,359
my girlfriends off of those buses all

1913
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:43,039
the time my first modus oper Ren die was

1914
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:47,079
if anybody was missing I would go and

1915
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:49,000
see josu in the buses and be like all

1916
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:51,639
right someone's missing and there they

1917
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,479
would be drinking chai in the back

1918
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:55,800
telling me they were having the best

1919
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:58,158
experience of their life and they were

1920
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,199
going to go home to Oklahoma with them

1921
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:03,198
so you know that's also you know the 12

1922
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:05,519
tribe also is a very amazing group of

1923
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:07,439
self-sufficient people that creates

1924
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,520
really good food at festivals like

1925
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:11,799
Common Ground Cafe now more of the

1926
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,840
common there's even 12 tribes up here in

1927
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,719
British Columbia and they have places

1928
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,760
that are really powerful so you know

1929
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:20,480
it's it's it's definitely a cult a lot

1930
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,280
of the Mustard Seed cafes and stuff are

1931
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:25,678
still run by them but they're not

1932
01:25:22,279 --> 01:25:28,118
they're not so um a scary they're like

1933
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:30,000
Earth loving Christian

1934
01:25:28,118 --> 01:25:32,079
anarchists I remember the common

1935
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,479
grounders that moved into Winnipeg and

1936
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:37,158
they were definitely very much the same

1937
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:39,959
people that had those buses on dead tour

1938
01:25:37,158 --> 01:25:43,118
they like come and eat our Bakery goods

1939
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:46,198
and told to stay away from those buses

1940
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:48,639
oh dude I'm telling you because I wanted

1941
01:25:46,198 --> 01:25:50,519
to see the people that they that they

1942
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:52,760
that they were able to attract same

1943
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,320
markk I'd go in there I'd check him out

1944
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:56,440
but yeah I was told the same thing

1945
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:59,118
fiddle music in the

1946
01:25:56,439 --> 01:26:00,638
background so so

1947
01:25:59,118 --> 01:26:02,599
endearing

1948
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,840
Spinners I wonder how many of those

1949
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,639
people still are around with their

1950
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,239
little

1951
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:10,039
followings yeah I don't know you know I

1952
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:11,839
would I haven't seen Spinners in a long

1953
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:13,840
time but that's definitely where I would

1954
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,800
hang out I'll say this much they

1955
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:19,279
couldn't keep up with fish five and a

1956
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:21,880
half hour spin one and that was pretty

1957
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:24,840
incredible I feel like I entered a new

1958
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:27,480
realm we talk a lot about you know drugs

1959
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:30,760
and and and meditation and things that

1960
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:34,238
get get you into other Realms and into

1961
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:38,239
you know other lines of thinking and

1962
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:41,079
spinning is unbelievably incredible and

1963
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:43,559
you know the whole Sufi religion is is

1964
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:46,559
sparked off of that and anyone who

1965
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:50,480
hasn't anyone who hasn't taken a moment

1966
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:54,440
to spin in a really big open field and

1967
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:57,238
spin past where you're scared spin past

1968
01:26:54,439 --> 01:27:00,759
where you're dizzy and there's this

1969
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:04,000
incredible calm in the center and you

1970
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:06,280
know people spin to find that incredible

1971
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,760
calm and they say that it's a place

1972
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:11,800
where you can clearly speak to God and

1973
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,880
it really is like a true place and I

1974
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:17,440
found that balance so many times at at

1975
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,400
Dead shows and I never even knew these

1976
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:22,198
people I never even spoke to these

1977
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:24,638
people I would just go and spin for four

1978
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:28,118
hours next to them and feel this

1979
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:29,760
vibration and and and find maybe some

1980
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:32,880
questions that I was looking for in the

1981
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,719
week or you know in my life between sets

1982
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,960
at Oakland there was the Spinners and

1983
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:39,158
the percussion players the percussion

1984
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,920
players just beyond the confines of

1985
01:27:39,158 --> 01:27:43,879
Shakedown Street usually toward the end

1986
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,840
they had the Disco bus you remember the

1987
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:48,880
Disco bus and so the Disco bus would put

1988
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:51,600
these really big speakers on top of the

1989
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,719
bus and just blare the loudest disco

1990
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:57,199
music and just attract this crowd of

1991
01:27:54,719 --> 01:28:01,158
really spun out people all around just

1992
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:04,719
grooving disco it great man it's so

1993
01:28:01,158 --> 01:28:07,399
fun spun out is when you don't find the

1994
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:09,880
center of the spin when you find the

1995
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:13,039
center of the spin you

1996
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:15,480
have you never spun

1997
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:19,800
out and I think it's interesting you

1998
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:22,839
know how the are you know extremely you

1999
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,840
know they're Muslim you know and but I

2000
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,560
think we're

2001
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,560
they also

2002
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:37,439
smoke very open to cannabis use and the

2003
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:39,319
Sufi religion connection and and the

2004
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:42,319
Disco bus for sure because it always

2005
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:43,799
made you say yeah after the show okay

2006
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:45,319
I'll have another hit because you knew

2007
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,880
the Disco bus was gonna go on for

2008
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:49,639
another four more hours and you were

2009
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:52,400
safe and Tak it out killer bags of weed

2010
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:55,719
were found at the Disco bus let's be

2011
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:58,198
real eventually nitrous mob would find

2012
01:28:55,719 --> 01:29:00,279
would find the Disco bus and so then the

2013
01:28:58,198 --> 01:29:02,599
people would start buying balloons which

2014
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:04,599
would feed the Disco bus so you'd have

2015
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:08,119
all these balloonatics all sucking on

2016
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:09,639
nitrous all danc in Disco it was just I

2017
01:29:08,118 --> 01:29:11,559
wonder how different the scene would

2018
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:13,440
have been if the full melt bubble could

2019
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:15,320
have been there on the early Grateful

2020
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:18,479
Dead

2021
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:22,319
days they never had it there was there

2022
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:24,799
was there was F there was bubble and

2023
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,679
Keef at Grateful Dead it this wasn't

2024
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:31,920
popularized in the same way there there

2025
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:35,079
were he insane hash oil makers in Eugene

2026
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,760
at the time so just not full melt hash

2027
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:38,359
you never saw full melt hash you might

2028
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:40,800
have seen hash oil but you weren't

2029
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:45,799
seeing full melt hash at those shows

2030
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:47,920
when you dry sift those dry sifts melt

2031
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,199
as as we know they do they absolutely

2032
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:52,600
melt they just aren't full melt they

2033
01:29:50,198 --> 01:29:54,759
melted what they thought was the melti

2034
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:57,039
of the dry sift they were probably 50%

2035
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:00,000
heads but there was just there was

2036
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:03,639
beautiful Origins there we'll say yeah

2037
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,279
also the old there was still an import

2038
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:07,000
uh business at that point with the

2039
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,359
hashes coming through so we said I mean

2040
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,639
none of it seemed very good but you can

2041
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:13,799
still get the uh kind of brown and black

2042
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:16,159
hashes that came in in bricks totally

2043
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:19,079
totally that was the more

2044
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:21,359
likely and I feel like that that would

2045
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:24,000
definitely Bubble Up I don't know

2046
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:28,000
anybody the tours you would buy it in

2047
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,359
they would just uh uh measure it out not

2048
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,238
have a scale because having a scale at

2049
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:33,639
that time either was difficult or it was

2050
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:36,039
always the triple beam and you didn't

2051
01:30:33,639 --> 01:30:38,840
really want to have a scale on you so

2052
01:30:36,039 --> 01:30:41,118
they had the long coils and then they

2053
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:43,000
would just measure it out to like a a

2054
01:30:41,118 --> 01:30:45,639
half inch or an inch and that was what

2055
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,039
the weight of it was and when you lit

2056
01:30:45,639 --> 01:30:51,039
that up right at first it definitely had

2057
01:30:48,039 --> 01:30:52,719
a sweet bubble to it but not it was

2058
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:54,479
really quite no no not even close to

2059
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,679
full melt but it would bubble just for a

2060
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:59,238
second and I remember talking about how

2061
01:30:56,679 --> 01:31:01,239
cool that was you know I just remember

2062

all experts at eyeballing the weight of

2077
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:38,519
cannabis just by looking at it the the

2078
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,679
art of eyeballing the gram and eigh and

2079

2095
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,760
festival I didn't that one the

2096
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:29,920
greenlands or something like that it was

2097
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:33,280
called I missed it yeah Susan's doing

2098
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:35,760
that I think Susan sorz was that a

2099
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:37,800
success or did did the people who put

2100
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,199
that together I mean are they gonna are

2101
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,600
is there going to be more things like

2102
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:42,279
that you know I think there'll

2103
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,600
definitely be more things like that yeah

2104
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:45,719
as soon as uh you know they would have

2105
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:48,000
had one this time I think it would have

2106
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:50,800
happened again definitely yeah I know

2107
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,479
Susan was also doing it at um oh what's

2108
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,400
the big Festival down in Southern

2109
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:59,319
California in this

2110
01:32:55,399 --> 01:33:01,679
February coella coella yeah yeah

2111
01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:05,399
Coachella that there as

2112
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:08,199
well are they gonna have stupid like cor

2113
01:33:05,399 --> 01:33:10,359
where you have to buy your cannabis over

2114
01:33:08,198 --> 01:33:11,638
here and you have to smoke it over here

2115
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:14,319
you're not going to be able to like

2116
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:16,079
mingle in the in the rest of the crowd I

2117
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,039
mean is it going to be like really

2118
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,719
restrictive on where you can use it do

2119
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:24,279
you know no I know people are trying to

2120
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:26,679
get kiosks at uh like Shoreline and

2121
01:33:24,279 --> 01:33:28,519
other places so that whenever there are

2122
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:30,920
shows they can actually show up and

2123
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:32,800
actually have a cannabis kiosk but I've

2124
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:34,800
only heard the discussions of that I've

2125
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,760
not actually seen it in real practice

2126
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,880
because that was all getting ready to

2127
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:41,520
kick off preco but yeah my fear is the

2128
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,880
same as you Mark is that you wouldn't be

2129
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,280
able to bring in your own cannabis you

2130
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,480
would have to buy this expensive ass you

2131
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:49,840
know whatever weed we decide you have to

2132
01:33:47,479 --> 01:33:50,718
buy and to consume it here I don't know

2133
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,719
if it's

2134
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:55,520
a

2135
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:57,399
or Beer Garden area that they're telling

2136
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,800
you to consume it in it's not like you

2137
01:33:57,399 --> 01:34:01,879
can buy it and take it back to your seat

2138
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,440
which is [ __ ] which is even worse

2139
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:06,159
with cannabis because they want to put

2140
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:07,799
up a wall because like somehow it's okay

2141
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:09,238
to see someone drinking something

2142
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,639
because you know that could be water it

2143
01:34:09,238 --> 01:34:13,599
could be juice it could be alcohol but

2144
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:15,560
smoking like in Washington they've done

2145
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,239
a few events and they make them put up

2146
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:19,480
an eight wall eight foot wall in the

2147
01:34:17,238 --> 01:34:21,198
park so you have a band over here and

2148
01:34:19,479 --> 01:34:22,599
you have this sectioned off eight foot

2149
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:25,198
wall where everyone's smoking weed and

2150
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,480
they can't see the band

2151
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:29,439
and then there's two people in front of

2152
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:32,319
the band like no see see here at the

2153
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:35,039
emerald Cup in California they have the

2154
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:36,920
alcohol people penned up in their pans

2155
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:38,880
and you can smoke cannabis anywhere

2156
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,399
pretty much so you know that's what's up

2157
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,760
that's how it should be and that's how

2158
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:45,799
hopefully it will become but yeah this

2159
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,520
separation of church and state yeah

2160
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:52,119
alcohol they need to be pinned cannabis

2161
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:54,560
should agreed agreed here here what's

2162
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:57,079
that s what's the biggest music event

2163
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,639
that folks have been to uh with me it

2164
01:34:57,079 --> 01:35:00,639
was 400,000

2165
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,520
people I would have to say my biggest

2166
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:07,799
event was certainly not a music event it

2167
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:11,600
was the Maha Kumba and I think there was

2168
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:14,039
like 2.8 million people there did you

2169
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,560
meet most of them I met like a good

2170
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:17,479
chunk of them you know all the ones with

2171
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:20,840
good hash anyway the ones that I needed

2172
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:24,559

01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:54,198

hand it was actually less than a hand oh

2192
01:36:13,158 --> 01:36:16,439
it happens I kind of wanted to change

2193
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:19,118
the subject a little bit because

2194
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:22,919
recently what I did was I went on a

2195
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:24,158
3-day tour here in um uh the interior in

2196
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:26,600
the okaga

2197
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:29,479
I went to Penticton and I went to Vernon

2198
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,679
and I went to Colona cruised around to

2199
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:33,879
some other little smaller spots like

2200
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,960
alliver and I went and visited all these

2201
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,520
different people with shops and I kind

2202
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,840
of wanted to get your guys's opinion on

2203
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,520
this because you know these people have

2204
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,039
some of them are Legacy some of them are

2205
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,080
not either way both sides have like

2206
01:36:44,039 --> 01:36:49,359
spent an enormous amount of time and

2207
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:50,920
energy to get to where they are by now

2208
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:52,719
first being potentially civil

2209
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,840
disobedient but now kind of saying okay

2210
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,039
we're going to follow the rules we're

2211
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,960
going to get in line we're going to jump

2212
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:58,519
through these burning hoops and so

2213
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,840
they've got their shops and of course

2214
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:03,560
you know all their shops are there's

2215
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:05,600
some difference um I definitely didn't

2216
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:08,719
come to the Cs I would have been at your

2217
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,480
place you kidding me um that was Josh

2218
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,880
and Kelly texting me privately better

2219
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:15,399
not have come to the CPS of course not I

2220
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:17,760
would be talking to you for sure so you

2221
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:20,039
know to get this out basically you know

2222
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:22,800
there's you can kind of create different

2223
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:25,800
Vibes in your shops but every single

2224
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,320
package look looks exactly the same so

2225
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,639
there you know it's this Canada

2226
01:37:27,319 --> 01:37:32,399
packaging thing that really kind of

2227
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:35,079
affects you know your ability to stand

2228
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:38,839
out I will give it up to the cottage I

2229
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:40,158
believe in Penticton um I've I I thought

2230
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,599
it was so cool and if you go on my

2231
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:44,479
Instagram you might still be able to see

2232
01:37:41,599 --> 01:37:46,079
the shots it was a little cottage and

2233
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:48,238
then you walk in and it looked like the

2234
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:50,519
foyer of a little old lady's home with

2235
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:51,799
these beautiful couches and plants and

2236
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:53,239
stuff and then there was plants growing

2237
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,920
Down the Walls and then you walked into

2238
01:37:53,238 --> 01:37:57,399
this great room that was all hardwood

2239
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:59,440
floors and all wooden kind of walls and

2240
01:37:57,399 --> 01:38:01,479
beautiful uh wallpaper like what's

2241
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:03,879
behind Josh and Kelly you know really

2242
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:06,079
cool all around the place it set a Vibe

2243
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,560
I felt like I was visiting my plug who

2244
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:09,479
stayed at his grandma's house the night

2245
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,000
before and then you walk in and there

2246
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:12,718
there's just a guy standing there behind

2247
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,960
a couple of counters and he was super

2248
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:16,599
nice and super cool and so you've got

2249
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,158
all these people working really hard

2250
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:21,480
trying to get this done and now you have

2251
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:23,118
this other element you have the

2252
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:25,000
indigenous people who are like well we

2253
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:26,920
want to play too we've got our

2254
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
sovereignty we want to play we should be

2255
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:32,719
allowed to play so I wish I remembered

2256
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,760
her name Selena who is in Vernon had

2257
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:37,880
told me the story of a good friend of

2258
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:40,560
hers who was a native is a native woman

2259
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:42,639
and was trying to go the the the route

2260
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,960
of the legal and it was just like one

2261
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:46,960
obstacle wall after another and finally

2262
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:50,039
she was like you know what I'm going to

2263
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,920
throw a c can down right on Native uh

2264
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:53,760
property and we're just going to start

2265
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:55,840
selling weed like that I think she even

2266
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,360
created something called The Green Mile

2267
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:00,039
where there's like a bunch of them all

2268
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:02,880
kind of together and if you drive

2269
01:39:00,039 --> 01:39:04,519
through the Okanogan they're everywhere

2270
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,279
they are literally everywhere and they

2271
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:09,400
don't have limits they can sell as much

2272
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:11,759
as they want they can advertise so they

2273
01:39:09,399 --> 01:39:14,079
have signs all over the highways and on

2274
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,400
posts and stuff and let me tell you it

2275
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:17,960
was a point of

2276
01:39:15,399 --> 01:39:20,118
contention with a lot of the shop owners

2277
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,639
and I think the rep that I was with was

2278
01:39:20,118 --> 01:39:24,279
extremely surprised when I said what I

2279
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:26,079
said and I think think you guys might

2280
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:27,479
have an idea what I'm going to say I

2281
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:29,439
said

2282
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:31,279
uh they they were like well it's not

2283
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:32,879
fair it's not fair they're you know

2284
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:34,238
there they don't have to follow the

2285
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,880
rules we've had to do all this stuff and

2286
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:39,039
I'm like really it's not fair hey h so

2287
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,840
but what about when you stole their

2288
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:42,679
children and murdered their ancestors

2289
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:46,000
what about when our ancestors did that

2290
01:39:42,679 --> 01:39:47,118
what about that that also was not fair

2291
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,639
well I thought the rep was going to have

2292
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:51,439
a heart attack when I said that to the

2293
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:54,039
first store owner in uh I think it was

2294
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:56,559
in pent tikton I found the conversation

2295
01:39:54,039 --> 01:39:58,639
to be enlightening I I told them that

2296
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,159
they need to get behind the indigenous

2297
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,840
population and the natives and they need

2298
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:04,039
to support them in every way that they

2299
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,639
can you do not want to stand against

2300
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:09,679
these people on this issue cannabis is

2301
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:12,840
actually making something a little bit

2302
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:14,800
right somehow cannabis is making things

2303
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:16,440
right for the native populace right

2304
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:20,119
population right now in Canada and I

2305
01:40:16,439 --> 01:40:22,039
just thought holy [ __ ] this is amazing

2306
01:40:20,118 --> 01:40:23,319
and I also convinced each and every one

2307
01:40:22,039 --> 01:40:25,920
of those stores that I had this

2308
01:40:23,319 --> 01:40:27,479
discussion with that it will help you

2309
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,880
believe it or not because the

2310
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:30,799
government's going to see it they're

2311
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,440
going to realize there's no competing

2312
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:35,440
with these No Limits and edible No

2313
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:37,198
Limits and go in and buy a quarter pound

2314
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:39,118
if you want and advertise on the street

2315
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:42,719
and I really am a firm believer that

2316
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:45,198
that's going to leech over into the the

2317
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:46,560
legal Federal program that we have now

2318
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:50,279
because there's no getting away from it

2319
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:54,280
this loophole is so good the government

2320
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:57,279
is absolutely [ __ ] on this one and

2321
01:40:54,279 --> 01:40:59,960
it's also the right thing to do yeah

2322
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:02,399
does that mean that the materials are

2323
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:05,599
not analyzed for

2324
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:07,479
safety I would say some probably are and

2325
01:41:05,599 --> 01:41:09,079
some probably aren't I don't want to say

2326
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:11,638
but yet they definitely don't have to

2327
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:14,319
follow all the same regulations uh in

2328
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:15,960
fact any of them it's their own thing

2329
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:18,279
and the shops are busy people are

2330
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:21,079
definitely buying at those Shops and and

2331
01:41:18,279 --> 01:41:23,960
uh you know Finding loyalty there so I

2332
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:25,559
think that not standing standing against

2333
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:27,480
them is one of the biggest mistakes you

2334
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,599
could make as a cannabis shop owner

2335
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:32,399
right now in my opinion and I'm going to

2336
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:35,719
say one thing we have we have such an

2337
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:38,238
incredible opportunity right now to be

2338
01:41:35,719 --> 01:41:41,198
able to work with the indigenous nations

2339
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:43,198
in Canada to be able to get rightful

2340
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:45,719
education in there because they have

2341
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:48,519
sort of a wide openen slate and we're

2342
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:50,599
finding that these shop owners and a lot

2343
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:53,960
of people of the first nations are so

2344
01:41:50,599 --> 01:41:56,199
incredibly open to doing it right and

2345
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,679
stepping in in a way that is really

2346
01:41:56,198 --> 01:42:01,519
empowering the First Nations and also

2347
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:02,960
empowering cannabis so we're working

2348
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,840
with the ministry right now we're

2349
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,920
putting together so many different Sops

2350
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,319
different pilot projects that's working

2351
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,480
directly with the First Nations peoples

2352
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:16,118
because this is a loophole that cannabis

2353
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:18,598
can have a higher better voice and a

2354
01:42:16,118 --> 01:42:20,559
higher effect on the federal laws so

2355
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:23,599
that we can put things into place to say

2356
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:26,080
see look at how this can actually be

2357
01:42:23,599 --> 01:42:28,719
done better so it would be really silly

2358
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:30,599
for the LPS to go against anything

2359
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,920
that's happening there because they also

2360
01:42:30,599 --> 01:42:34,599
have the ability to go through this

2361
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:37,118
direction to change the way that

2362
01:42:34,599 --> 01:42:39,279
cannabis Commerce is being done today

2363
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:41,198
also so it's a really incredible

2364
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:44,079
opportunity and thank you so M much

2365
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:45,559
Marcus for both defending that and also

2366
01:42:44,079 --> 01:42:48,279
bringing up this because we've been

2367
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,760
living and breathing this um in our home

2368
01:42:48,279 --> 01:42:52,559
right now and working with the ministry

2369
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:56,159
and writing down Sops and really working

2370
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:58,440
hard to uh you know give cannabis more

2371
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:01,279
of a medical stance which is where it

2372
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:03,039
needs to be there's a lot of deep issues

2373
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:06,118
on that and I would encourage people to

2374
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:09,960
look up uh what residential schools are

2375
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:12,399
in Canada and also uh indigenous women

2376
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:15,359
going missing and murdered in Canada is

2377
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:18,279
a really huge thing and also in First

2378
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:20,439
Nations um and in there in tribes

2379
01:43:18,279 --> 01:43:23,319
there's a lot of issues with addiction

2380
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:25,638
and and and cannabis is is helping that

2381
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:27,880
so there's a lot of tribes and Nations

2382
01:43:25,639 --> 01:43:30,639
that are coming together to accept it to

2383
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:33,239
help them you know with their addictions

2384
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:35,400
so um we see it as a really positive and

2385
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:38,519
I and I also you know for any people who

2386
01:43:35,399 --> 01:43:41,439
are associated with LPS in order to have

2387
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:43,760
LPS there has to be a portion that

2388
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:45,519
you've been uh you've made a commitment

2389
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:47,159
towards education you've made a

2390
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,440
commitment to the communities that

2391
01:43:47,158 --> 01:43:52,759
you're set up in and I really want to

2392
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:55,118
plead and encourage these LPS to reach

2393
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:57,920
out to these indigenous Nations to reach

2394
01:43:55,118 --> 01:44:00,559
out to a lot of these different shop

2395
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:03,800
owners and let's start swapping

2396
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:06,920
education let's use that Federal funding

2397
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:09,760
to make bridges for cannabis this is

2398
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:12,840
really important and we still have doors

2399
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:14,639
open um to create more education for the

2400
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:17,079
general public as well as for the First

2401
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,960
Nations as well as for a lot of

2402
01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:21,319
addictions that Josh was just mentioning

2403
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,960
that are just super incredibly High here

2404
01:44:21,319 --> 01:44:26,439
in Canada currently in British

2405
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:29,319
col can help currently in British

2406
01:44:26,439 --> 01:44:31,638
Columbia addictions and opioid deaths

2407
01:44:29,319 --> 01:44:35,799
are killing more people than covid if

2408
01:44:31,639 --> 01:44:37,800
I'm not you know on that and also yeah

2409
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,360
it's it's way higher so it's like oh

2410
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:42,000
great we're all wearing masks but that

2411
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:43,519
does is not stopping desk but uh Johnny

2412
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,880
B looked like you had something to say

2413
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,760
and I'd be interested to hear what you

2414
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,639
what you were thinking comes to medical

2415
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,239
and you're talking about this and and

2416
01:44:49,639 --> 01:44:54,159
and you can go into into say chillak and

2417
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,479
and I can go in and buy a chocolate

2418
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:58,638
that's 10 milligrams but I can go down

2419
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:02,079
the street to the reserve and buy a bag

2420
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:03,359
of gummies that's 250 milligrams so I

2421
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,800
mean there's quite a difference when it

2422
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:08,399
comes to medical so I mean if you're in

2423
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:10,760
need of those type of Edibles that's

2424
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:12,519
where you go because they actually have

2425
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,239
what you need they actually have those

2426
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:17,880
high doses so I don't have to sit here

2427
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:20,359
and eat like 25 of these I'm taking 250

2428
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:22,400
milligram caps I go to the store here I

2429
01:45:20,359 --> 01:45:24,799
can only buy 10 milligrams at a time so

2430
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:27,039
that's really disgusting and then if I

2431
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,960
if I buy more than four items well

2432
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:31,519
that's over my 30 grams so I actually

2433
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:33,880
have to leave and go back in right so I

2434
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,719
mean you got to go home and then go back

2435
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:37,920
in because you can't have all of that on

2436
01:45:35,719 --> 01:45:40,599
you out in the world you'd have wait a

2437
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:44,399
second I'm medical so I can carry 150

2438
01:45:40,599 --> 01:45:46,360
grams so I can go in and out a few times

2439
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,000
because I am Medical but once again so

2440
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:50,679
I'm gonna have to walk out with a huge

2441
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,439
Bay in order to get my so that's why I

2442
01:45:50,679 --> 01:45:55,319
like what's going on with with um

2443
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:57,198
what's happening on the tribe stuff is

2444
01:45:55,319 --> 01:45:59,679
they're actually able to cater to those

2445
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,079
high doses Edibles that are needed and

2446
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:03,000
and that's one other thing that the

2447
01:46:01,079 --> 01:46:05,079
government's really got to lighten up on

2448
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,920
because that's another encouragement for

2449
01:46:05,079 --> 01:46:08,479
people to go there and get proper

2450
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:11,639
dosaging for themselves because you

2451
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:13,238
can't get that in the legal system in

2452
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:14,719
reality but that is a legal system so

2453
01:46:13,238 --> 01:46:16,959
let me rephrase that you can get this

2454
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,800
only in certain parts in the system that

2455
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,840
are legal you know what also Johnny that

2456
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:25,360
there's there's this real limitations

2457
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:27,800
with the legal system for um for LPS and

2458
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:29,799
the limitation is that if we want to

2459
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:31,960
supply a province they're going to

2460
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:33,719
require that we you know make some

2461
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:36,279
product you know sell it to them and

2462
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:38,399
then if they sell that product and it's

2463
01:46:36,279 --> 01:46:40,039
good and people like it they want to be

2464
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:42,079
able to order it right away and if you

2465
01:46:40,039 --> 01:46:43,920
don't have it available to order right

2466
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:46,519
away you can fall to the bottom of the

2467
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:48,840
que and so people are desperate to make

2468
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:51,000
sure so right away that limits you

2469
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:53,400
massively now there's no way that you

2470
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,439
can support a craft grower

2471
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:57,319
um to who's only growing small amounts

2472
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:58,519
because what I'm going to buy 50 kilos

2473
01:46:57,319 --> 01:47:00,960
from this guy and he's not going to have

2474
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:02,760
it again for three more months like this

2475
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,520
might sell out in two days I might need

2476
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:07,560
to re have a reorder available in seven

2477
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:10,800
days it's another reason why we're

2478
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:12,280
limited to not seeing 90 Micron 73

2479
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,960
Micron how the hell am I going to

2480
01:47:12,279 --> 01:47:16,599
produce 10 kilos of just 90 Micron and

2481
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,359
then have another 10 kilos of it

2482
01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:22,239
available in a month or a week or or two

2483
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:25,079
months so what happens is all of that

2484
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:27,759
other small lot gets funneled into

2485
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:29,399
medical the very place it shouldn't be

2486
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,320
because when medical people find

2487
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:33,598
something that they like they love they

2488
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:35,118
need and you're never going to make it

2489
01:47:33,599 --> 01:47:36,440
again oh sorry man that was just a

2490
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:37,960
couple hundred grams you know we just

2491
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:39,559
got a certain amount of stuff from so

2492
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:41,158
and so and we're probably not going to

2493
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:43,039
see that stuff anymore I think he killed

2494
01:47:41,158 --> 01:47:45,319
the Clone you know like so they've got

2495
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:47,760
it set up to protect the recreational

2496
01:47:45,319 --> 01:47:50,599
market so you always have more and it's

2497
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:52,520
available or you drop the queue but they

2498
01:47:50,599 --> 01:47:55,079
they've left the most vulnerable people

2499
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:57,480
once once again the very people who

2500
01:47:55,079 --> 01:48:00,118
everyone used as their shield for the

2501
01:47:57,479 --> 01:48:02,439
last 10 plus year in Canada so they

2502
01:48:00,118 --> 01:48:04,559
could continue to grow cannabis sell it

2503
01:48:02,439 --> 01:48:07,118
and pay their mortgages while claiming

2504
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:09,320
it was for the patient uh it's just

2505
01:48:07,118 --> 01:48:12,519
[ __ ] I mean there's a lot of

2506
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:15,399
[ __ ] still there but Civil

2507
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:17,280
Disobedience got us this far A little

2508
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:18,679
bit more Civil Disobedience we'll get us

2509
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:20,359
further sorry Debbie did you have

2510
01:48:18,679 --> 01:48:23,118
something to say oh I I didn't mean to

2511
01:48:20,359 --> 01:48:24,839
interrupt I'm so sorry but uh yeah on

2512
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:26,118
the topic of [ __ ] I wanted to tell

2513
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:29,480
you guys the bad news about the

2514
01:48:26,118 --> 01:48:31,319
California law which is that um uh

2515
01:48:29,479 --> 01:48:32,718
people who live on the uh Native

2516
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:34,679
American reservations here if they want

2517
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,480
to participate in the Cannabis industry

2518
01:48:34,679 --> 01:48:40,960
they have to uh sign away their

2519
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:44,479
Sovereign rights so uh there there is

2520
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:46,239
only one cannabis company that's owned

2521
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:47,559
by Native American in the entire State

2522
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:48,799
nobody that lives on the reservation

2523
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:50,840
who's going to sign away their Sovereign

2524
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,279
rights to to be able to participate in

2525
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:56,279
the Cannabis industry it's a absolute

2526
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:57,840
travesty travesty so yeah I was gonna

2527
01:48:56,279 --> 01:48:59,759
gonna bring that up I'm in Washington

2528
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:03,039
and it's the same similar deal because

2529
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:05,480
of the federal lack of federal um you

2530
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:07,760
know allow allowance that the tribes

2531
01:49:05,479 --> 01:49:10,000
here they they in Washington choose to

2532
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:12,119
operate underwat they've done it they a

2533
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,399
pack deal and it's been a big big to-do

2534
01:49:12,118 --> 01:49:15,679
took them a couple years to figure out

2535
01:49:13,399 --> 01:49:18,960
they did some pack but they basically

2536
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:20,440
operate as if they're licensed

2537
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,719
recreational stores you wouldn't know

2538
01:49:20,439 --> 01:49:24,238
the difference they have the same

2539
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:26,679
product they buy from 502

2540
01:49:24,238 --> 01:49:28,959
producers um interestingly they they

2541
01:49:26,679 --> 01:49:30,920
lined it up where they can ship to other

2542
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,920
tribes so they kind of did have that

2543
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:36,319
forethought that they could ship to any

2544
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:39,039
other Sovereign Nation you know tribe

2545
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:40,799
but um it's it's it's not what you're

2546
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:42,000
talking about Marcus you know and they

2547
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,320
didn't have the they didn't have the

2548
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,639
guts I think because of the our you know

2549
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:49,920
our federal deal you

2550
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:53,480
know and

2551
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:57,399
totally giv

2552
01:49:53,479 --> 01:49:59,439
right I mean that's the game right now

2553
01:49:57,399 --> 01:50:02,000
and I don't necessarily want to get into

2554
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:04,039
it right now we're dealing with state of

2555
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:10,000
emergency all over the place here in

2556
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:12,479
Canada and S rights are being given left

2557
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,880
right and center and handing it over I

2558
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:18,598
know that's a bigger conversation but

2559
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:20,000
wow my heart goes in down into the chair

2560
01:50:18,599 --> 01:50:21,599
and I think people could look so

2561
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,639
relevant right now they could look into

2562
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:24,639
what it means to be a

2563
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:37,960
I'm thankful for what's happening in

2564
01:50:34,118 --> 01:50:41,359
Canada right now though because there is

2565
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:44,840
you know a medical program that is still

2566
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:46,960
functioning and that is a good thing for

2567
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:49,679
medical people and I would just on the

2568
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:51,760
note of someone finding a strain or one

2569
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:53,800
particular varietal that works for them

2570
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,280
and then being worried

2571
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:56,719
about whether they can get it again I

2572
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:59,840
think it's really important for those

2573
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:02,960
people to look into potentially if they

2574
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:06,800
can having that strain on their land and

2575
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:09,078
growing that as one of their four plants

2576
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,800
because especially in Canada you can do

2577
01:51:09,078 --> 01:51:14,118
that

2578
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:17,079
and nothing

2579
01:51:14,118 --> 01:51:19,279
connects yeah grow your own now you're

2580
01:51:17,078 --> 01:51:22,238
connected to the plant itself you're

2581
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:23,359
connected to the create life creation

2582
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:25,078
process

2583
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:26,479
and you're making your own medicine

2584
01:51:25,078 --> 01:51:29,078
which is a

2585
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:30,919
self-empowering action and you're

2586
01:51:29,078 --> 01:51:32,519
continuing to have the same varietal

2587
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:34,880
that works for you and if you can grow

2588
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:36,719
four of your own and you're going to do

2589
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:39,359
it outside because you don't want to

2590
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:41,000
invest a whole bunch of money into

2591
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:43,359
having an indoor system and you don't

2592
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,399
know how to do it well I really suggest

2593
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:48,000
that you do it regeneratively because if

2594
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:49,920
you need those 200 milligram gummies

2595
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,599
throughout the whole year then you want

2596
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:54,279
to grow those plants really really big

2597
01:51:52,599 --> 01:51:55,639
and you want to grow them heavy weight

2598
01:51:54,279 --> 01:51:57,759
and you want to grow really good

2599
01:51:55,639 --> 01:52:00,239
medicine that you can have throughout

2600
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:02,760
the year and now that is having

2601
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:04,839
sovereignty with cannabis so if we want

2602
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:07,000
to talk sovereignty with cannabis

2603
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:10,199
everybody can grow their own cannabis

2604
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,920
still here in Canada and really we all

2605
01:52:10,198 --> 01:52:14,960
need to take the federal government up

2606
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:16,639
on that and also have medical for more

2607
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,880
than than

2608
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:20,760
four say yeah and those four plants

2609
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,599
could be as big as you can grow them you

2610
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:25,560
look down south they're growing plants

2611
01:52:22,599 --> 01:52:28,039
getting 25 lbs out of one plant so I

2612
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:30,639
mean you can veg this all through your

2613
01:52:28,039 --> 01:52:32,599
winter inside if you want the first bed

2614
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:35,078
of sunshine put that thing outside bury

2615
01:52:32,599 --> 01:52:37,199
it in the dirt have those soils ready

2616
01:52:35,078 --> 01:52:39,679
and feed that thing because it's going

2617
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:42,118
to reach for the skies guys and and you

2618
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,679
can really because you're not limited to

2619
01:52:42,118 --> 01:52:47,158
how much you're only limited to how many

2620
01:52:44,679 --> 01:52:49,480
you can only carry 30 grams with you but

2621
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:52,279
when you're at home Sky's a limit so

2622
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:54,279
remember that so it's not about you can

2623
01:52:52,279 --> 01:52:56,559
get as much as you can there's different

2624
01:52:54,279 --> 01:52:59,078
methods of growing four plants indoors I

2625
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,840
did one plant under each light I've seen

2626
01:52:59,078 --> 01:53:02,559
people now just at a place that got

2627
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:04,639
completely bouns out a plant made one

2628
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,159

2629
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,880
I was pretty amazed I'm going to go back

2630
01:53:06,158 --> 01:53:09,559

doubt we're also we're also heading out

2661
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:33,000
to Victoria um to see a fight with um

2662
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:36,559
Elias who is the first Canadian athlete

2663
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:39,118
to be a THC um cannabis athlete and he's

2664
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:42,000
on our story right now so big love to

2665
01:54:39,118 --> 01:54:44,399
Elias and the work that he's been doing

2666
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,198
at becoming a cannabis athlete so we're

2667
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:49,198
going to be supporting really and really

2668
01:54:46,198 --> 01:54:51,598
pushing uh the the conversation forward

2669
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:54,799
that how silly that year saying that

2670
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:57,679
it's okay to use a plant but only part

2671
01:54:54,800 --> 01:55:02,320
of the plant and and this sort of you

2672
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:03,840
know uh separatism has to has to end oh

2673
01:55:02,319 --> 01:55:06,279
okay well you can use the plant but you

2674
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:08,560
can only use part of the plant and if

2675
01:55:06,279 --> 01:55:11,359
you use this part of the plant then you

2676
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:14,480
could be tested and I mean it's just

2677
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:16,960
absolutely ridiculous I think that often

2678
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:19,879
humans run themselves in a circle and

2679
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:22,480
eat their tail and we just need to stop

2680
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:26,319
this the plant gives us what it needs in

2681
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:28,238
the right doses that for us to to to be

2682
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:31,319
able to get relief from and for us to be

2683
01:55:28,238 --> 01:55:34,078
able to live happier healthy lives

2684
01:55:31,319 --> 01:55:37,078
especially athletes who are not really

2685
01:55:34,078 --> 01:55:39,679
supported except by sponsors and maybe

2686
01:55:37,078 --> 01:55:41,679
they only would get free material or or

2687
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:43,840
you know free whatever from different

2688
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:46,440
sponsors but they're not supporting

2689
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:49,319
their health their longevity and their

2690
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:51,759
well-being well into the future so that

2691
01:55:49,319 --> 01:55:53,880
conversation really needs to change

2692
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:56,400
because there's a tremendous amount of

2693
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:58,719
Youth that look up to athletes in the

2694
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:01,759
world and the athletes need to carry the

2695
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:05,078
conversation forward with the sponsors

2696
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:07,840
backing them of Education of health and

2697
01:56:05,078 --> 01:56:10,319
well-being so that the youth can be

2698
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:13,440
raised in that type of an

2699
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:15,599
educ and I would just add that part of

2700
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:18,759
cannabis what it's given us is Earth

2701
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:21,000
conscious it's giving us that nature

2702
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:22,719
awareness so like when Johnny B's

2703
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:26,238
talking about having to go to the store

2704
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:29,279
and get a stack of 10 milligram things I

2705
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:31,359
mean that's a lot of garbage so why so a

2706
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:33,639
lot of sugar we're healing ourselves

2707
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:35,719
while ailing the Earth or getting

2708
01:56:33,639 --> 01:56:38,960
diabetes to be able to get 200

2709
01:56:35,719 --> 01:56:43,078
milligrams like there let's create a

2710
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:45,880
little bit of sense here in the idea of

2711
01:56:43,078 --> 01:56:48,118
holistic understanding like and I have

2712
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:51,239
to bring it back to science like we keep

2713
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:53,639
relying on only this

2714
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:56,799
idealized you know

2715
01:56:53,639 --> 01:56:59,800
specific you know standard that takes

2716
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:02,520
away all of the holistic V versions of

2717
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:05,400
it and then we are only looking at

2718
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:08,280
things with blinders on and the more

2719
01:57:05,399 --> 01:57:10,598
that we sort of open up the conversation

2720
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:15,439
and sure we can use that scientific

2721
01:57:10,599 --> 01:57:17,880
experiment for one of the great

2722
01:57:15,439 --> 01:57:20,839
discoveries to be able to explain

2723
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:22,719
something that's fantastic but if we're

2724
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:27,199
using it as the

2725
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:30,239
only way to explain something and also

2726
01:57:27,198 --> 01:57:33,839
be able to make laws and move forward on

2727
01:57:30,238 --> 01:57:35,879
then we're really missing out on you

2728
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:38,199
know something so much more deep and

2729
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:41,000
something so much more powerful for

2730
01:57:38,198 --> 01:57:41,000
Humanity as a

have a as a group deem P have been

2778
01:59:44,439 --> 01:59:49,678
talking about creating a

2779
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:52,400
regenerative uh Farm not Farm but an

2780
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:55,599
inner city urban farm where you

2781
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:57,719
transform a a a vacant lot into a

2782
01:59:55,599 --> 02:00:00,078
beautiful garden and also he's talked

2783
01:59:57,719 --> 02:00:02,639
about creating I think this is good for

2784
02:00:00,078 --> 02:00:04,799
other Municipal areas where they'd have

2785
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:08,000
local backyard gardens come together as

2786
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:11,760
a co-op and make medicine for themselves

2787
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,760
so neighborhoods of people getting

2788
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:16,360
together growing four plants in their

2789
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:17,920
backyard and then creating meetings

2790
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:19,759
where they can share how to make

2791
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,639
medicine together and they all make the

2792
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:23,400
medicine together to work to give to

2793
02:00:21,639 --> 02:00:25,118
themselves throughout the winter it's

2794
02:00:23,399 --> 02:00:27,479
self-empowerment it's Community

2795
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:29,238
empowerment and it's it's herbalism you

2796
02:00:27,479 --> 02:00:31,439
know it's it's learning about herbalism

2797
02:00:29,238 --> 02:00:33,238
because you'll always have companion

2798
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:34,759
plants you'll always have flowers and

2799
02:00:33,238 --> 02:00:37,439
mint and all the other things and what

2800
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:40,679
brings Community together better than

2801
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:43,919
talking about their buds that they grew

2802
02:00:40,679 --> 02:00:46,000
in their backyard I mean come on we all

2803
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:49,118
love talking about our buds that we grow

2804
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:52,520
so it's it's you know Josh and I always

2805
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:54,719
say that backyard gardens

2806
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:57,119
you know are going to save the world and

2807
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:59,279
actually believe that they might be the

2808
02:00:57,118 --> 02:01:01,920
only thing

2809
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:03,759
can they have to to save the world so I

2810
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:06,480
think it's like a bee song they Mis

2811
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:08,840
wrote it it's come together right now

2812

groups I don't think people realize how

2817
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:28,000
hard it is to administrate these groups

2818
02:01:26,399 --> 02:01:29,679
on Facebook and that there's a lot of

2819
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,158
people who go there just to kind of

2820
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:33,399
cause trouble and we're just kind of

2821
02:01:31,158 --> 02:01:36,078
trying to curate these groups to share

2822
02:01:33,399 --> 02:01:38,519
information to let everyone kind of gain

2823
02:01:36,078 --> 02:01:41,799
information and it's endless how many

02:05:30,198 --> 02:05:35,519

loss really love you guys thanks so much

2912
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:40,880
and I just wanted to say that this time

2913
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:44,839
has you know created such incredible

2914
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:48,159
divisiveness you know in the world in

2915
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:50,679
politics um and now you know

2916
02:05:48,158 --> 02:05:53,439
unfortunately even within on households

2917
02:05:50,679 --> 02:05:57,239
so you know know this divide is being

2918
02:05:53,439 --> 02:06:00,598
felt everywhere and and it's running

2919
02:05:57,238 --> 02:06:06,000
really really deep and I guess just

2920
02:06:00,599 --> 02:06:08,800
since it's Valentine's Day you know I

2921
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,719
think that building bridges for love is

2922
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:11,440
really

2923
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:15,639
important

2924
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:18,719
and you know if we're gonna make a

2925
02:06:15,639 --> 02:06:21,078
choice and I just always really resonate

2926
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:23,279
with what the the ancient Buddhists say

2927
02:06:21,078 --> 02:06:25,000
and and and the dreamers who dreamed

2928
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:28,238
this existence into

2929
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:31,319
time and that's love and

2930
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:34,479
fear and I just really encourage

2931
02:06:31,319 --> 02:06:38,238
everyone listening and all of us and

2932
02:06:34,479 --> 02:06:40,238
even myself to really resonate In Fear

2933
02:06:38,238 --> 02:06:42,759
And I mean resonate in love and to

2934
02:06:40,238 --> 02:06:45,598
outride fear because it really isn't

2935
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:48,520
serving anything and it just creates a

2936
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:53,520
continuous noise so happy Valentine's

2937
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:53,520

2938

Hitters um Growers breeders panel I

2975
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:21,199
think it's going to be really awesome

2976
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,960
with the group of guys that they got on

02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:23,799
there

2978
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:26,399
I also wanted to mention that I did

2979
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:28,760
invite corvan Cooper on through his

2980
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:31,238
group he just was released from prison I

2981
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:35,360
guess he was one of the guys that got a

2982
02:08:31,238 --> 02:08:36,759
uh um Trump um pardoned him and so I

2983
02:08:35,359 --> 02:08:38,519
thought it would be cool to use hash

2984
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:41,119
Church platform to help him with his

2985
