11

point for lunch I mean from a from a

34
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:17,118
perspective of someone that rides a

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,759
lot pretty epic [ __ ] highway to have

36
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,599
right every day you could leave this

37
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,159
place and go in Van or up to Whistler on

38
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,759
this highway I don't know how a guy

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:31,759
could uh ever have a bad day riding on a

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:36,040
road like that it's it's incredible Shin

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,599
of Falls was incredible wow standing

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,360
underneath those waterfalls my back to

43
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,118
it and the water coming down from all

44
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:46,239
that way up everything was powerful what

45
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,438
a what a what a burst of energy I got

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,478
from Mother Nature that was some

47
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,798
humbling [ __ ] yeah it was awesome good

48
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,959
hike up to the B base of the falls too

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,439
you know what that's the [ __ ] that you

50
00:01:53,959 --> 00:02:00,199
do with troubled youth and that's the

51
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:03,000
[ __ ] I did when I was actually 14 133

52
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,079
pette Bay we went to Boulder Bay

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,399
cruising up to the waterfall we went

54
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,799
Boulder hopping you know Boulder hopping

55
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,840
it has that danger that a young 14 15y

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
old boy is looking for but they don't

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,400
care about that part of the danger but

58
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,719
you know what I mean it's it's the kind

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,840
of danger that it doesn't hit back as

60
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:22,159
hard you make a mistake you slip you

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,719
smack your head on a rock it's not quite

62
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,000
the same as you know playing around with

63
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,479
guns or you know doing doing the things

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,840
that the troubled youth are getting into

65
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,719
these days so defitely saw that as a

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,920
really good potential for kids that are

67
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,959
uh one thing with the troubled youth

68
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,719
that I had experience with is the the

69
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,199
youth these

70
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,759
days they do things out of fear stabbing

71
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,598
shooting whatever because they don't

72
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,679
want to just own up to their problem or

73
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,560
face the problem they had they created

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,080
or or even have one put in front of them

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,158
that that they didn't true uh simple

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,640
wrestling match fist fight whatever

77
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,479
usually always solved it when I was a

78
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,958
kid that's what always and we were and

79
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,439
we were buddies afterwards some of my

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,360
best friends that I had when I was a

81
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,079
little kid one of my best friends today

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,799
that we ended up having little scraps

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
When We Were Young I didn't fight much

84
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,959
but I watched that happen many times

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,200
Prince George crazy scrap and then their

86
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,598
