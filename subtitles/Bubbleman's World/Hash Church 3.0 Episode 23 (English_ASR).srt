amazing papers were presented and then

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Saturday was the

57
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,158

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,840
presentations was done by Colton about

59
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,798
himself

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,920
that's so awesome it was it was great

61
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,519
especially at the end they had this Q&amp;A

62
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,518
thing for the faculty that presented and

63
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,439
you got all of these distinguished

64
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,879
clinicians many of whom I know on the

65
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,280
zoom call and then there's Colton who

66
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,280
was just really far out man I think

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,840
he'll probably be in that crew one of

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,280
these days good morning

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,920
Mark yes hey guys how are you good Mark

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,878
it was really weird when I just joined

71
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,919
there was this automated recording that

72
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,158
came on saying that this is being

73
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,479
recorded did you hear that two way okay

74
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:42,280
well the reason that is is because

75
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,318
usually yeah I I usually you guys have

76
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,560
been showing up lately and then I go

77
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,280
live on YouTube and go recording but I I

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,719
went live and I started recording

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,318
earlier I guess that's a legal message

80
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,799
to let you know that hey if you don't

81
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,878
want to be recorded don't come into the

82
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,438
chat

83
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,959
room yeah the last little window before

84
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:05,479
you go live says do you consent to be

85
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:09,079
recorded or something like that

86
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,798
okay see welcome to the big time

87
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,439
Mark yeah well it's like you know it

88
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,280
could be intimidating for people like

89
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,879
Sam right maybe that's why he's not here

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,439
yet ah he's like [ __ ] that I'm not gonna

91
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,839
be recorded I had even thought of that

92
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,040
wow

93
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,159

microphone from these ones

101
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:45,079
to to my actual microphone so that

102
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,038
should be better it won't be quite as

103

115
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,599
late last night as I've been putting my

116
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,120
son to bed for the last month um trying

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
to give my wife a little bit of a break

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,240
of every single night having to do the

119
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,919
same thing and you know sometimes when

120
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,800
you work all day the you know your wife

121
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,959
is like oh I feel bad you worked all day

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,680
well so did you you also worked all day

123
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,279
with kids which is even harder than

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,959
working all day at a job so for the last

125
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:45,159
23 days I've been putting my son to bed

126
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,439
and I generally fall asleep with him at

127
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,400
around 9 o'clock I I can't stay awake

128
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:54,360
when I put him to bed so uh yeah if it

129
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:57,000
was a little bit of uh but that gets you

130
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,680
up at like 4 in the morning right well

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,759
we definitely get up pretty early I'm

132
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,959
not going to lie I've been up for hours

133
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,600
right now not quite 4 but probably you

134
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,120
know a little bit just a little bit

135
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,560
after 6:00

136
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,038
a.m. so that's once the birds start

137
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
singing especially here in the

138
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:16,360
springtime it it becomes difficult

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,199
because um it just it's such a great

140
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,720
thing to hear birds in the morning I

141
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,439
mean I love it yeah

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm with uh with some people who sleep

143
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,959
with their windows open it's just it's

144
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,039
so loud that there's no way you can get

145
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:34,239
back it's true uh both both in the

146
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,120
morning and at dusk the birds are so

147
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
loud here at dusk it's incredible

148
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,800
they're flying around from tree to tree

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm really right smack in a in a in a

150
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,639
forest so it's uh no shortage of

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,919
incredible birds in fact my son found a

152
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,439
bird yesterday a little baby had fallen

153
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:54,399
out of his nest in one of our Hedges and

154
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,439
uh yeah

155
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,239
he found him saved him helped Birds

156
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,439
aren't real they Birds AR I've heard

157
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,840
I've heard of this birds are some kind

158
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,079
of alien robots that fly around well

159
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,560
this

160
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,279
one yeah right it looked real though I'm

161
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,478
telling you I know they're not real and

162
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,638
all I don't want to be uh laughed at or

163
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,478
whatnot but where did that come from how

164
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,400
did we get into that how did it I I've

165
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,120

00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:30,120
day that the plants are kind of doing

191
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,080
their Fibonacci doubling process so

192
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,639
we're getting a lot of growth right now

193
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
and it's a lot of fun to watch yeah I

194
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,120
you know John brought me these monster

195
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,158
plants just just a couple of them you

196
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,399
know two or three of them the other day

197
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,080
and uh they've only been on my deck for

198
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,958
a couple of days but I'm saying I'm

199
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,800
thinking they've grown about a foot to a

200
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,039
foot and a half these bushes they were

201
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,079
just big round bushes and now they've

202
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,879
got these you know these piece these

203
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,040
giant just coming all off the top and

204
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,519
it's I haven't grown in so long you know

205
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,919
I'm so I I envy what you guys do and I

206
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,919
love growing and I love getting my

207
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,399
fingers dirty and I love the whole

208
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,719
concept and idea I just personally have

209
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,519
not had a lot of time to do it so um

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,839
good old Johnny B shows up with some

211
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,399
plants and I'm back in the game and uh

212
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,200
it's fun right there's like this the

213
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,759
nervousness of wanting the plants to be

214
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,440
healthy and happy and give them

215
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,838
everything they need while just being

216
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,839
like Oh my God I got to give these

217
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,720
plants attention and love and focus and

218
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,200
even three monsters I'm uh I really have

219
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,600
to make time for because they you know

220
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,800
they drink 15 to 20 gallons of of water

221
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,320
every day they're

222
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:43,000
thirsty just like your son they have

223
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,440
needs they have needs they have needs

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,480
and their needs must come before my

225
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
needs sometimes you fall asleep with

226
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,120
them don't

227
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,240
you absolutely absolutely I was on my

228
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,519
roof yesterday and I was happy to see

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,039
them poking up above the the second roof

230
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,000
I could see them you know they're

231
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,679
they've got got to be over 10t tall

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,078
right now so only Johnny B would just

233
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,639
bring me three 10 foot tall plants in

234
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,039
the back of his truck and I'm in the

235
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,078
meantime I'm like please tell me you

236
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,439
didn't put those into the truck yourself

237
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,399
because he's he's got a disc thing going

238
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,000
on right now he's got some pretty major

239
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,958
pain he was in and out of the hospital

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,039
and I just the last thing I want Jon to

241
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,719
do is uh destroy himself through

242
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,199
kindness so luckily he got his neighbors

243
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,560
Mike and Hy to put the plants in the um

244
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,959
in the back of the truck and I got got

245
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:37,119
my 17-year-old son heos as we call him

246
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,359
uh to uh to lift out the uh to lift out

247
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,120
these plants you know Johnny B style he

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,079
didn't wait for them to get like dry he

249
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,519
he moved them like fully fully like 80

250
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,479
plus pounds per per

251
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,440
plant uh but that's what's great about

252
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,759
having a 17-year-old son for any of you

253
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,040
whose son has not reached that age yet

254
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,720
man you can't you can't imagine how

255
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,039
amazing it is when your son just can

256
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,040
lift and carry everything no wonder

257
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,759
people back in the day on farms just put

258
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,759
their kids to work I mean it's funny

259

is how that [ __ ]

264
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,519
operates and in some cases in Ontario I

265
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,680

that you can like tap into when you

278
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,120

environments is I'd love to bring

306
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,920
attention to the fery Creek Watershed

307
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,600

308
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:32,399
there um there's uh only 2%

309
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,519
you know old growth left in British

310
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,039

311
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,519
at all

312
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:43,120

uh raising the The Cutting of by 43% of

318
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,639
old growth forests and there's only two

319
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:05,919
2.3% old growth even left in BC so

320

they're they're they're basically out to

321

attack and and murder the rest of our

322
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:16,439
intact environment in in America in the

323
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:19,720
United States most all of the old growth

324
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,279
is already in protected forests there's

325
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,278
really

326
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:31,039

327
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:01,719
so there's tree sitters they're first

328
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:05,278
tree Sitters of people that are sitting

329
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,959
in trees for over 30 years there's

330
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,639
there's activist people sitting in trees

331
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,078
trying to stop loggers are laughing at

332
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,680
them they're stealing their stuff

333
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,359
they're they're they're T they're taking

334
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:20,679
down their camps the RCMP are basically

335
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,159
private mercenaries for this for this

336
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,879
land occupation and for this type of big

337
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:30,000
business they're out cutting, 1500 year

338
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:35,078
old trees right next to people sitting

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,519
in trees they're taking chainsaws to I

340
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:39,359
don't know if anyone's ever smelt a

341
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,959
yellow cedar but a yellow cedar doesn't

342
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,839
actually doesn't grow in in in Oregon it

343
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:47,119
doesn't grow in California or Washington

344
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,279
it's like a Alaska and British Columbia

345
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,360
thing that the smell the incense like

346
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,559
that that the odor that there's

347
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,839
something totally otherworldly about the

348
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:01,198
yellow

349
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:04,360
cedar and um I just really want to

350
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:09,000
activate people to make phone calls to

351
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:12,480
John Horgan's office and to krine

352
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,480
Conroy and to the BC

353
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,319
RCMP and to all other people that they

354
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,600
find in their own network the teal Jones

355
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:24,759
group who's doing the cutting and and

356
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,759
let that the people know that we're not

357
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,159
okay with losing our last intact

358
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,318
environments once these trees are locked

359
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,120
they'll never be replaced the these

360
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:37,318
environments will never be replaced

361
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,440
they're 14 and 18 feet across which are

362
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:43,479
really really big for Cedar where Craig

363
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,240
is down in the in in in the Redwoods and

364
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,000
over in the Sierra Nevadas with the

365
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,959
Seas there's trees up here that rival

366
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
those redwoods there there's 300 foot

367
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,799
tall

368
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,198
ceders in this Forest that's being ready

369
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,278
to to get cut which are among the

370
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,519
tallest trees in the world like the

371
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,000
Redwoods

372
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,078
so it's all I can think about right now

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,400
I I

374
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:12,318
feel extremely passionate as well as my

375
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,679
family it it right now in British

376
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:18,959
Columbia Wood prices are through the

377
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:21,759
roof so everywhere you go in the forest

378
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,558
right now you're hearing chainsaws and

379
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:28,240
trees falling it's like a

380
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:32,678
genocide on cedar trees the cedar trees

381
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:36,160
are so valuable right now that private

382
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,960
land owners are just raking down their

383
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,120
land private logging companies are

384
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,120
raking down their land and it's and and

385
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,319
raw log exports is another thing for

386
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,359
people to be aware of raw log exports

387
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,079
there's something like

388
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:56,079
230

389
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:58,199
cubic three 230 million cubic feet of

390
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,439
raw log exports a year coming out of

391
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,519
British Columbia

392
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,840
we're talking about massive ships with

393
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,119
just raw logs thrown on them so am I

394
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,480
talking about no logging no that's not

395
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,879
what I'm talking about I understand that

396
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,279
there's a place for logging and and

397
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,559
sustainable harvesting and I and I know

398
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:19,079
that and I understand living in wooden

399
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,839
houses and I get that what we're talking

400
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,158
about is logging an intact environment

401
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,599
that'll never be replaced when you when

402
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,799
you talk about beautiful when you talk

403
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,558
about British Columbia it's beautiful

404
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,679
British Columbia or Supernatural British

405
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,319
col but the government is sanctioning

406
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,600
the destruction of our environment and

407
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:38,000
it's not okay with us and I just really

408
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,839
want to encourage people to to step up

409
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,440
and to call look at our story and make

410
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,798
phone calls if you can if if you feel

411
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,519
like you have time to make those phone

412
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,960
calls to let the the people know that

413
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,279
our voices have been

414
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,200
heard thank you so much for letting me

415
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,440

activism is cannabis part of our

419
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:05,839
activism is in psychedelics and another

420
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,759
part of our activism is in saving our

421
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,359
lands because without our lands there's

422
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:15,558
no health and and just one more time the

423
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:16,719
RCMP are targeting indigenous people on

424
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:21,079
their

425
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,079
lands it it's it's the the word it's

426
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:27,319
everything that you read in your history

427
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:31,960
books happening right now in the forest

428
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:35,558
it's not history it's present day

429
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,558
occupation thank you so

430
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,440
much thanks for sharing that Josh

431
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,240
definitely pretty [ __ ] up to be

432
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,120
thinking about these trees just uh that

433
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,759
take hundreds of years to be produced to

434
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,158
grow into the the the

435
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:55,158
Magnificent beings that they are and

436
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:58,400
then to just have like chainsaws you

437
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,360
know the just I'm a I'm a I've lived on

438
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,600
my property for 11 years and I've never

439
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,199
cut a tree I live in a neighborhood

440
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,839
where people are obsessed with cutting

441
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,558
trees because they want to have a

442
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,079
view and I like trees in my view I

443
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,399
wonder if these people when they're done

444
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,480
with getting rid of all the trees in

445
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,240
their view if we'll also drain the ocean

446
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,798
so we can see the bottom better I don't

447
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,720
know I hope not uh but it does seem a

448
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,519
little bit mental in my neighborhood

449
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,240
today and I'm happy to say I only

450
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,279
noticed this a couple Sundays ago and

451
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,798
it's really not probably that big of a

452
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,879
deal but every Sunday I hear chainsaws

453
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,519
in my neighborhood every single Sunday

454
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,919
so I guess you know some lady got on to

455
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,918
the Lion's Bay board and she passed a

456
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,520
little ordinance and now it's Sundays

457
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,600
are quiet Sundays so you can't go like

458
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,798
Leaf blow and turn on your CH you can't

459
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,918
turn on your chainsaw the noise was the

460
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:51,480
least of my worry it was and for any of

461
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,038
you that have ever watched my videos and

462
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,839
I have over a thousand of them on

463
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,879
YouTube you'll remember random chainsaw

464
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,158
guy that I used to always mention

465
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,039
because any anytime I went out onto my

466
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:07,200
deck to make a video any time of day or

467
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:09,960
night some [ __ ] would have a

468
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,880
chainsaw going like two seconds I turned

469
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,640
the camera on i' be like hey

470

Yeah we missed that but it was kind of

472
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:24,038
perfect I think yeah perfect yeah I I'll

473
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,839
just you know some of these native women

474
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:29,359
like these Elders that are getting

475
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:31,319
arrested right now like uh

476
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,839
have are are were

477
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,278
were they've had to deal with laws where

478
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:39,079
only no more than four indigenous people

479
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:42,200
could gather

480
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:46,399
together what these native Elders have

481
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,240
lived through laws where they could not

482
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,559
gather we're not talking about Co no

483
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,558
we're talking about you can't be more

484
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:56,839
than four native people at once or

485
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:59,200
you're against the law what has and and

486
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,678
and also residential schools

487
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,278
you know where they're taken out of

488
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,440
their lands and and to maid speak

489
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,679
English and to disconnect them from the

490
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,278

there thanks for being on with us

508
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,319
yes good morning and thank you Josh for

509
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:08,240
Rolling that out I've been following

510
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,278
along in the stories and doing uh a

511
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,038
small share of reposting and just trying

512
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:16,880
to bring some awareness and this is so

513
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:19,679
real and it happens here in our our

514
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,760
community as well um those of you that

515
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,200
have driven the 101 through the uh

516
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,759
humble Mendo State Line like we're

517
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,360
battling

518
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,599
calr there because they want to widen

519
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,839
the road so trucks could go bigger

520
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,480
trucks and could travel through there

521
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,678
and faster and right now it's like we

522
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,919
call it the Redwood curtain because they

523
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,919
have to a certain length of semi need to

524
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,080
unhook and get put on by a little

525
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,880
tractor uh semi to pull it through there

526
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,119
but it also slows everyone down to 40

527
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,880
miles an hour and and it's like it's

528
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:57,239
almost like going to church for a minute

529
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,480
like we go 65 forever and then it's like

530
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,000
just slow down

531
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,159
and and appreciate what we have um but

532
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,278
yeah Josh you you brought up a lot of

533
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,960
valid points like you're seeing I live

534
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,159
in a wooden house and these fur beams in

535
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,000
my house came from my land and I cut

536
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,278
those down um we have our land

537
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,319
personally was was pretty hammered by

538
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,839
the loggers and grew up all at one time

539
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,158
um there's a couple seed trees left here

540
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,000
or there so we are taking the chainsaws

541
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,559
out and doing a bunch of man agement

542
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,640
because what's grown back has grown back

543
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:39,319
as as Mother Nature didn't really

544
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,000
plan and in time it would correct itself

545
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,839
you know it's it's choking out some of

546
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,720
the smaller species and they're falling

547
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,519
and and we have this dead and dying

548
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,079
thing happening and you know uh bringing

549
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,839
back the carbon sequest sequestered

550
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,720
carbon back into its own ecosystem but

551
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:57,480
with the fire danger we have right now

552
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,120
we can't wait for mother nature so we do

553
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,599
have to step in do some of our own

554
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:05,119
management practices um just in our

555
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,639
little footprint here um but we are

556
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,879
doing we're chipping it and we're we're

557
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,120
using that to build soil and so forth

558
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,600
but I think those of you that are

559
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,519
listening that are hearing the talk

560
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,439
about trees I think you really have to

561
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,240
have critical thinking and I so much of

562
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,038
that critical thinking is gone out the

563
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:27,240
window these days it's it's with Corona

564
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:29,158
and all these other things folks have

565
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,359
just thrown the critical thinking out

566
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,919
and it's it's platforms like this that

567
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:37,558
help us bring these Minds together and

568
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:40,038
and share our thoughts and thank you

569
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:43,200
Marcus time and time again for holding

570
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:46,519
space for all this community and

571
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,640
everyone here um we appreciate you um

572
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,639
for what you're doing thank

573
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,679
you appreciate the kind words very nice

574
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,480
to uh start it off with some realness

575
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,120
this morning you know like uh I

576
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,519
personally absolutely love visiting old

577
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,439
growth forests I have a cedar Forest a

578
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,639
standing Cedar Forest that's just up the

579
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,919
road uh just up past Whistler we have an

580
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,919
ancient Cedar forest and they're pretty

581
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,520
big trees 20 to 25 feet in diameter

582
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,720
they're impressive they take your breath

583
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:21,599
away of course toino MIRS Island um some

584
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,960
really beautiful trees out that way as

585
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,240
well and it's just such a shame to to to

586
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,278
see them be cut down and even for people

587
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,038
that were here you know back in the day

588
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:34,079
when logging was happening in the 50s

589
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,798
and the 60s it was really just one tree

590
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,278
that would hit the that would hit the

591
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:39,720
truck at a time now you see these

592
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:43,679
logging trucks yeah like one tree for

593
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,399
multiple trucks even um oh look at that

594
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,840
nice little treats Sharon oh yeah you

595
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:50,759
know I hope Brian shows up from best

596
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,639
friend Farms because he's been doing

597
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,000
these incredible like cookies and like

598
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,240
donuts and like just kind of like they

599
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,720
look really like a treat that you would

600
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,839
would eat and uh I meant to mention it

601
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,880
last week but we got sucked so far down

602
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,959
the rabbit hole of sensory science uh

603
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,720
that it he by the time I went to go see

604
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,640
if he was in the room he had bounced he

605
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,319
had some problems with his um with his

606
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,440
internet so hopefully he comes back in

607
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:22,278
I'm about to Puff A little dab of some

608
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:25,120
120 Micron strawberry banana this

609
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:27,200
[ __ ] this is definitely what dreams are

610
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,519
made of right here let me tell you if

611
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,080
this right here this is literally how we

612
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,599
could stop these [ __ ] from

613
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,158
cutting down trees because I'm telling

614
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,959
you a couple of heroic dabs of this and

615
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,720
there's just no way that those people

616
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,640
are going to decide that yeah this is in

617
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,038
my best interest and wow as humans we

618
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,559
get caught up like you could you could

619
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:49,839
just feel the polarity the tension

620
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,839
between a logger and an activist you can

621
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:56,038
you can just the way we just have these

622
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,199
different mentalities and I can't help

623
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:00,398
but feel that the compelling of speech

624
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,399
speech is getting us into a very

625
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:06,079
dangerous position here in life as we

626
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:08,959
start to compel speech there are certain

627
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,960
things we can talk about and there are

628
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,679
certain things we cannot talk about and

629
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,360
if we talk about those things we will

630
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,600
ostracized we will be ridiculed and we

631
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,798
will be punished and I'm not necessarily

632
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,639
talking about any one particular thing I

633
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,558
just you know for a long time this

634
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Jordan Peterson guy was like listen this

635
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:28,639
isn't about these issues it's about

636
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,360
compelling speech

637
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,960
and controlling speech and we are now

638
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,359
getting into a level of compelling of

639
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,278
compelled speech that maybe we've never

640
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,759
seen before in the history of our

641
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:44,640
species and um I hope one day that it

642
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,839
doesn't become you know insane to talk

643
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,200
about saving trees I hope one day that

644
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:51,558
they don't decide to ostracize us and

645
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,319
make us look like uh conspiracy freaks

646
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:55,158
because we think that trees produce

647
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,398
oxygen and that we want some of them to

648
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,440
be alive because I see a lot of things

649
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,439
getting cast into that sort of well we

650
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,519
can just disregard that because we have

651
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,159
this argument against that plus we've

652
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,599
compelled speech so they're not really

653
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,880
allowed to talk about that anymore

654
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:13,398
anyway freaks me out a little bit in the

655
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,799
meantime I'm G to have a little

656
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,278
dab Marcus I uh I kind of resemble that

657
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,839
remark that you just made about if we

658
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,200
had a few more light depths of

659
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,599
strawberry

660
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,798
banana just planted one I don't know if

661
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,519
you guys can see it up there on my big

662
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:33,558
flat yeah right on we planted it into

663
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,120
native soils um I've I've been starting

664
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:39,158
to utilize this technique of uh

665
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:41,518
trenching with a a a trencher making

666
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:45,039
just a little cut because we have where

667
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:48,880
we have Clay and Shale it is so

668
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:51,640
compacted like it's ridiculous um from

669
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,880
some of these logging sites so I've I've

670
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,440
tried this technique where I'm trenching

671
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,919
down and then putting the wood chip and

672
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,798
uh inocular ated straw and building

673
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,640
soils that way and then putting putting

674
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:06,480
a little bit of locally sourced Nursery

675
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,159
stock soil just around the the plant

676
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,960
itself so it can go out and give it

677
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,120
itself a minute um and uh it's it's

678
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,759
coming along nicely and I I'm excited to

679
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,319
see how this one comes out it's the

680
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,480
first time I've done it as a light dep

681
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:20,879
I've done it as fullterm where you have

682
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,599
more time for those roots to get

683
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,240
established and tap into the biology

684
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:30,558
light up is a interesting one to uh do

685
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,599
in Native oils um as some of you know it

686
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,319
it takes just an extra minute you have

687
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:37,719
to be a little more patient but once it

688
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,720
kicks in it's it's

689
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,720
phenomenal

690
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:46,599
cheers uh does your trench drain water

691
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,360
or does it hold water when you make it

692
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:52,199
Craig yeah so uh Josh you've been here

693
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,158
and down at our Huckleberry flat place

694
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,639
the lower place that we actually sold

695
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:00,240
that was more of a Shale finger of the

696
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:02,240
of the mountain and there it actually

697
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,200
functioned really nicely and that's

698
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,679
where we went a bit deeper and we put a

699
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,080
lot of wood chip in the bottom of that

700
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,880
one so it would be a sponge and capture

701
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,000
the water before it just drained down

702
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,320
through the shell in this one I had a

703
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
problem even with a

704
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:21,319
trencher getting through the the hard

705
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,638
pan clay like it was just like bouncing

706
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:27,278
um so this one I really feel it's going

707
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:28,798
to hold water and we are being super so

708
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,038
it's the opposite now so instead of

709
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,359
trying to create a sponge at the bottom

710
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,440
and hold water that was passing through

711
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,439
this one will be using just minute water

712
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,840
and then a bunch of this wood chip that

713
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,519
we've we've recently made we've put in

714
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:46,319
the pathways and and along the edges and

715
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,000
actually part of the technique is

716
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,599
prepping the flat before we even operate

717
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,038
the trencher so um sometimes if we have

718
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:57,519
the time we would um put down a loose

719
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,519
fill straw kind of the Ruth Stout method

720
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,960
so loose fill straw and then two inches

721
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,919
or so of uh raw manure let that sit over

722
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,880
the winter then trench and then you're

723
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,440
bringing the native over it like a

724
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,600
lasagna layer and you know I'm not one

725
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,840
for using

726
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,079
mechanized uh tools but sometimes when

727
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,519
you're on the mountain you don't have a

728
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,519
choice and you bring them in one time

729
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:25,480
and then you're good but the tailings of

730
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,359
the trencher are really nice it's really

731
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,038
nice structure to it and it it it makes

732
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:35,678
a really nice lasagna layer now up here

733
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:38,519
um we didn't have the time so we did the

734
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,679
we did the straw wood chips and then we

735
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,079
let the chickens out on it for two weeks

736
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,080
and the chickens went through and got

737
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:49,240
all the hay seeds out and you know uh

738
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,000
inoculated with their with their manure

739
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,079
um and then we trench and then when we

740
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,519
bring that native soil on top it keeps

741
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:57,480
that clay tailing from becoming Anor

742
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,558
robic um and that's also really

743
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,880
important with the the manures as well

744
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:06,079
so now we have that um on top and then

745
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,679
we will come through and probably put a

746
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,638
really light layer of wood chip um and

747
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,000
then I also picked up some spawn blocks

748
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:17,240
from mushroom Mike um and I'll be

749
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,119
inoculating that the pathways first and

750
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,399
then with a pathway being like that

751
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:26,278
thick with uh wood chip we will uh

752
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:30,278
inoculate that and then we'll come in

753
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:31,960
with um some compost te and just dump it

754
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:37,359
and dump it and dump it and let that be

755
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,360
the biology spread out in

756
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,919
on there you can spread that on your

757
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,480
aisles you know little seed of some

758
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,240
biology from different places and over

759
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,280
the year your aisle is creating the

760
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,838
indigenous microorganisms because when

761
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,599
you use rice to create indigenous

762
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:20,639
microorganisms you're going to get a lot

763
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:22,519
of trichoderma you know the green molds

764
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,919
that come on under heavy and and

765
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,199
trichoderma and and no one's actually

766
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:30,199
testing the species on the rice so when

767
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,398
you use more locally sourced raw

768
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,719
materials to build your indigenous

769
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:38,118
microorganisms then you're going to get

770
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,358
more diverse biology from your region

771
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,200
because rice doesn't grow in your region

772
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:45,119
so how is biology going to have the

773
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,559
intelligence to propagate itself only

774
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,599
certain things will propagate itself so

775
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:53,599
really by using wild brasses and leaves

776
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,200
and your indigenous soils coming up

777
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,920
manures mushroom blocks these are all

778
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:02,919
things that grow in the region and have

779
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:07,680
a more complex carbohydrate a more

780
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:09,320
complex carbon for biodiversity which is

781
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,480
really what we're looking for so I

782
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,920
really love that you know you're taking

783
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,599
on the aisle Tech and that that's not a

784
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:21,358
word but it maybe it is now but you know

785
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,800
the Isles are there's so much Earth that

786
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,639
can come from there for the next year

787
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,359
and and I love you Melanie

788
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,639
congratulations you are amazing thank

789
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,719
you for your passion and you know and

790
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:36,639
your uh your completion of your uh

791
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,439
education that's really a really big

792
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,358
deal we all love you so much and you

793
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,559
know that well thank you Josh I

794
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:44,078
appreciate it it's quite an

795
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,719
accomplishment and it feels amazing um

796
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,800
to be done and um it amazing it's

797
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,199
amazing just to want to keep going too

798
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,000
right it's going to be uh really neat to

799
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:53,679
see what you know what the future holds

800
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,920
for all of us and thank you to my

801
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,679
husband for the support oh thank you

802
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,920
have a good time

803
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,279
and of course the two beautiful girls of

804
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,119
course yeah you know one one thing that

805
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,519
Melanie is going to be going on and and

806
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,160
teaching is public speaking and all of

807
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,199
us realize what an important tool that

808
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,759
is you know we can have these

809
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,480
regenerative tools we can have these

810
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,240
political views we can have this

811
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,318
activism but without being able to speak

812
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:26,318
and deliver it properly and accurately

813
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:29,559
um' be lost so I sure appreciate her and

814
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:29,559
and more so just

815
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,639
um to find what's inside of ourselves

816
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,078
and be able to express that

817
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,759
authentically in our way so me me

818
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,880
expressing myself the way that Melanie

819
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,440
does is different than the way that you

820
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,358
would or that Josh would or you know

821
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,599
it's it's just encouraging people to

822
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,799
trust who they are and trust that they

823
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:03,440
can express themselves in a way that

824
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,440
that is like

825
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:19,838
them original thought is um lacking

826
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:23,079
these days so that's why it's important

827
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:27,039
to turn off your electronics every once

828
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:28,599
in a while and go experience yourself go

829
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,318
experience your surroundings go

830
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:35,359
experience your cannabis go touch your

831
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:38,679
soil go be in tune with intuition

832
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:41,639
because intuition and and and feelings

833
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,159
it it's it's it's learned it's it's a

834
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:44,920
it's a muscle it's it's something that

835
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,440
you that you get you have to you have to

836
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,680
teach yourself I mean people that are

837
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,599
remote viewers or people that are

838
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,239
intuitives they they work on it you know

839
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,960
so you know let's work on using our

840
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,239
voice let's work on our original thought

841
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,679
what's authentic to us it's important to

842
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:02,919
be part of a group too because Community

843
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,759
is part of our our our importance but

844
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,838
you know bringing original thought to it

845
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,000
is extremely important Johnny be's in

846
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:09,000
the

847
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:16,199
house have time Johnny be in the house I

848
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
would say what Josh was just saying is

849
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:23,480
to spend time with the

850
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:24,639
sublime because the sublime is humbling

851
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,079
and you

852
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,358
will we'll all be a little bit

853
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,920
the way I put it the other day to a

854
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:33,598
friend is you know what we'll be a lot

855
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,480
less dicks if we're just we'll be a lot

856
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,000
nicer if we can just share time with

857
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,039
this humility and that is to stare the

858
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,880
sublime in the face go jump off a

859
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:44,199
mountain go snowboard down a mountain go

860
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,960
spend time in a garden go out in the

861
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,598
middle of the ocean and feel how

862
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,800
insignificant you are because um yeah

863
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,599
it's it's okay to be humbled the world

864
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,599
could use more of

865
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,199
it good morning morning

866
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:06,039
everybody we're growing hemp right now

867
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:09,109
from Daryl Hudson and in planta

868
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:09,110
[Music]

869
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:18,079
and you know the

870
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,680
valov does everyone know who Nikolai vov

871
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,480
is uh just curious but anyway in in the

872
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:27,639
1920s Nikolai vov travel World

873
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:30,159
collecting cannabis seeds and also other

874
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:34,318
and created The vov

875
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:37,879
Institute now he was one of the fourth

876
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:40,838
foremost genetic seed collectors of the

877
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,000
world at the time but over the course of

878
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,719
the years he became ostracized by the

879
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,599
community and eventually jailed and then

880
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:52,239
eventually starved to death in jail now

881
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:57,559
The vavilov Institute still exists and

882
00:39:52,239 --> 00:40:00,039
has lots of seeds um also uh you know

883
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:04,039
that combined with the historical hemp

884
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:06,079
of China um we're we're we're we're

885
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:08,559
looking at at hemp in a different way

886
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,400
right now because yeah High CBD is super

887
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:15,838
important it's an obvious medicine um

888
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,800
but food and fiber coming out of hemp is

889
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,159
going to be what saves us from the

890
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,440
forest industry or potentially Bill

891
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:27,598
Gates uh you know whole meat thing or

892
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,280
whatever to save the the Earth and stuff

893
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,160
like these seeds are the largest seeds

894
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,119
I've ever seen and they grow up to 18

895
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:38,118
feet tall and have giant stocks and they

896
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:42,039
can outproduce the forest industry in

897
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:44,160
cellulos and fiber by I don't know the

898
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,199
number four to five times you know they

899
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,078
way outproduce Timber sales when it

900
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:54,639
comes to biomass and when it comes to

901
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:57,400
say pellet fuel or C creats and stuff

902
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,879
so we are putting our best foot forward

903
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,599
to continue these genetics outside of

904
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,440
CBD outside of medicinal and and

905
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:07,838
continuing the work of food and fiber

906
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:12,000
hemp you know because this this is part

907
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:15,679
of what makes cannabis the master plant

908
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,480
that it is you know you don't become a

909
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:21,960
master plant in evolution without having

910
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,800
you know thousands of uses and uh that's

911
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,480
what this plan offers and and we know

912
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,240
that um so I feel really blessed right

913
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:34,199
now to be able to stand in the presence

914
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:36,919
of thousands of years and hundreds I

915
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:39,118
think every cannabis plan is is a is a

916
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,960
thousand- year old you know

917
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,480
multi-generational creation whether it's

918
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,039
a hybrid or from an ancient stock but

919
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,039
being able to reinvigorate that ancient

920
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,759
stock is pretty phenomenal and I'm want

921
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,960
to go grab the seeds real quick so you

922
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,160
can see the size of them I did do a post

923
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:02,240
of them and some people saw them but

924
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:04,598
I like that check that out I love that

925
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,399
that's that's what that plant can I feel

926
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,640
like I feel like Sam showed me the

927
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,838
biggest and the smallest seeds I've ever

928
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,598
seen in my life and he did it like all

929
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:16,480
within the same like 30 second span of

930
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,160
time and and the smallest

931
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,440
ones I uh got from cashmere and the

932
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:28,399
biggest ones from Yan but I did work

933
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:32,318
with a Vala for five six years and uh

934
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,318
I had access to every seed they

935
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:40,039
had but did they have access to every

936
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:42,880
seed you had did you have access to

937
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,599
seeds let's see that look let me get

938
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,240
this in my

939
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,920
hand are these the Walnut

940
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:53,639
seeds

941
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,639
yeah let me see if I can

942
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,359
should I get a

943
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:07,440
scale yeah I'm

944
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:11,400
curious biggest I ever biggest I ever

945
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,400
had with 12 to one

946
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,400
gr I love that Sam has a reference

947
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,200
point like just think just think of that

948
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:25,800
for one second okay he's going to weigh

949
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,838
these monster seeds and Sam says to him

950
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:33,079
oh the biggest ones I ever had had were

951
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:35,759
12 to 1 gram who [ __ ] knows

952
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:37,960
that you know I I don't I don't know how

953
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,319
many how much my seeds weigh

954
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:44,358
particularly but I know how many fit on

955
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:45,880
a teaspoon of my legacy genetic you know

956
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,159
so I know I can take a teaspoon and

957
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,720
that's about a

958
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,759
100 and you're like you're that's like a

959
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:56,039
lid that's an alpen glow lid is that

960
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:59,160
what you're saying yeah yeah a

961
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,599
spoon that's awesome very cool I can't

962
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:02,598
wait to see how much these seeds weigh I

963
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,359
want to see how many he gets in a gram

964
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,760
the ones Sam put in my hand literally

965
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:08,558
were like small walnuts I I remember G

966
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,640
laughing when I first saw them I was

967
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,839
like this is ridiculous and those were

968
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,799
not the most insane seeds Sam ever put

969
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:16,599
in my hand because the most insane seeds

970
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,559
he ever put in my hand were like from

971
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,760
some burial from like 2,000 plus years

972
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,760
ago he's like check these out and I was

973
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,359
kind of like what what are these like

974
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,680
they look really

975
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:31,519
old this is from the 100th anniversary

976
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,598
of the Balo

977
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:38,280
Institute oh nice how old were those

978
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:43,838
seeds that you had from like the burial

979
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:46,680
uh oh those are uh I think 1700 years

980
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:49,759
old almost 2,000 years

981
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:51,838
old those seeds were the seeds that was

982
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,079
the only cannabis thing I ever held in

983
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,880
my hand that I really like the hair

984
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,039
stood up on the back of my neck when I

985
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,680
realized what they were and of course

986
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,239
you know Sam just throws them at me like

987
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,838
they're nothing just like what

988
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:08,519
valof institute folks took me over to

989
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,960
the Hermitage Museum where the seeds

990
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:17,358
were from the uh

991
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:20,559
uh it was from the roseno burial tomb

992
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:25,318
where he roseno is the one who dug it up

993
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:28,240
and they found uh these you know uh 1700

994
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:30,920
2,000 year old seeds and they gave me

995
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:34,318
eight of them that they found in a

996
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,559
little little Leather Pouch buried uh

997
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:39,719
under the ground with all kinds of other

998
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,680
cool Treasures from the

999
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:45,399
cynthian did you try and germinate them

1000
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:47,960
Sam oh yeah so I've got him going right

1001
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,960
now in my

1002
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,119
backyard no they they were completely

1003
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:57,440
dried out and uh you know there was no

1004
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:01,880
oil in them

1005
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,838
at all anymore they they were bit though

1006
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,280
may maybe they were okay when they dug

1007
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:09,480
him up because it was in the whole tomb

1008
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:13,040
was buried in ice for all this time but

1009
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:16,480
what happened was uh they started the

1010
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:19,039
museum for you is 20 30 years before

1011
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,039
they came to

1012
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,280
meet and they were almost 2,000 years

1013
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,519
old

1014
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,760
so I want to see these seeds Josh are

1015
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,358
you weighing those seeds over there I

1016
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,680
think we just realized Josh still lives

1017
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:38,679
in the days of paranoia and his scale is

1018
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:42,358
out in an olive Barrel like in the back

1019
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:45,719
40 I gotta go dig it up it's funny back

1020
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:45,719
within the hour

1021
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,119
Triple Beam it was pretty

1022
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:07,358
funny if these Hills could talk yeah man

1023
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:07,359
that's

1024
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,199
awesome so Dr Mark what's going on man

1025
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,720
how did the uh how did the test go with

1026
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:24,039
the uh I believe you you were telling me

1027
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:26,279
you had thcv and uh or cbdv I I can't

1028
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:30,279
remember what can what novel cannaboid

1029
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:32,599
you you're you you got a new line on

1030
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,240
that you're trying to to work

1031
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,359
with what what what company was that and

1032
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:41,598
what what canabo no so it was a company

1033
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:46,000
that was selling uh thcv

1034
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:50,480
isolate and um uh the

1035
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,318
company um is called Snapdragon CBD and

1036
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,838
they're at of Tennessee and they were on

1037
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:59,239
the Adam dun show and Adam or Adam's guy

1038
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:02,078
called me up and had me come on the show

1039
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:03,679
real quickly a couple Fridays ago and

1040
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,000
they just happened to be on and they're

1041
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,639
like hey we got thcv isolate I was like

1042
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,639
w really wow let's get some of that see

1043
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:13,639
what that's like so yeah I

1044
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:21,400
ordered yeah so it it it it it is pretty

1045
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,440
pure but it's totally Delta 8 configured

1046
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,800
right so it's it's not Delta 9 thcv it's

1047
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,039
it's Delta 8 so makes me think that

1048
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:36,760
they're just converting it from from

1049
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:40,000
cbdv so cbdv like CBD makes an isolate

1050
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:42,280
and you could uh convert that isolate

1051
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,519
over to the THC form and if you start

1052
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:48,280
with cbdv you make T8 CV so obviously

1053
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,920
yeah this is like what people are doing

1054
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:54,720
out in the marketplace now people have a

1055
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:59,000
lot of access to like large amounts of

1056
00:48:54,719 --> 00:49:01,279
cbdv I guess so I mean I yeah I well

1057
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,280
maybe

1058
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,798
not large amounts Markus but they're

1059
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:08,798
able to make isolate from from

1060
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:10,639
distillate um I I guess I mean where

1061
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:12,798
else does it come from I mean the other

1062
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,719
thing is that um I don't know if you

1063
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:19,719
guys are on future

1064
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:23,358
4200 but there's this fella ion trap

1065
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:27,159
there who's uh actually testing a lot of

1066
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:31,519
Delta 8 products and finding all whole

1067
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:34,440
soup of really nasty chemicals in there

1068
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,480
not only the starting materials and what

1069
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,880
happens when they so what they do is

1070
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,760
they they take CBD and they treat it

1071
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:47,119
with acid and that converts it over to

1072
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:51,160
THC um but um it also unzips the

1073
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:54,000
molecule and and rips the the turpine

1074
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:56,239
portion of CBD off the ring and makes

1075
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,599
this compound called olivetol and you'll

1076
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:03,519
know lolic acid is the the the precursor

1077
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:06,079
to all the canono in the plant and aitl

1078
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:09,679
is not something that you want to be

1079
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:14,839
consuming and um and so this guy is out

1080
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:14,838
buying samples of

1081
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,358
and if they're less pure you'd think

1082
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,838
that you know they would just throw that

1083
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:38,119
away but they end up in things like

1084
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:39,679
gummies where you know yeah the consumer

1085
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:41,200
is going to be tasting the gummy but

1086
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,798
they're not knowing that the crap that's

1087
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:47,919
in there is only like about 50 or 60%

1088
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:50,960
pure meaning that there's 40% other crap

1089
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,280
in there and he's finding things like

1090
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,920
phades in one sample he actually found

1091
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:01,640
dioxins and dioxins is a real really uh

1092
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,920
toxic class of of molecules and to make

1093
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:08,199
dioxins my gosh they must have just a

1094
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:11,440
toxic soup of of stuff in there and

1095
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:14,798
these folks are just hemp processors

1096
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,559
they're not um they're not chemists like

1097
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:19,639
me and they they don't understand that

1098
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,599
what they're making is they're making a

1099
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:25,558
chemical mixture and then thinking that

1100
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:27,960
it's okay to put into uh and safe to put

1101
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,359
into products clearly not their focus

1102
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,240
their focus is to find an exploit in the

1103
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:33,679
system and to be able to make money

1104
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,719
where they thought they previously

1105
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:38,318
couldn't and it's been the it's been the

1106
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:42,399
name of the game since the beginning of

1107
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:46,318
hemp being grown in the US because you

1108
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,559
guys it it it it could be done clean and

1109
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,159
pure that there's ways that you can

1110
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,839
action course of course but that's not

1111
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,078
your when that's not your focus when

1112
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,920
your focus is just to find the exploit

1113
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,519
to make money these are the

1114
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,519
repercussions

1115
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,078
right and you see that they banned it in

1116
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,960
Colorado and I think one of the reasons

1117
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,480
why they banned it in Colorado is

1118
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,480
because the Delta n Lobby is so strong

1119
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,960
in Colorado and certainly the Colorado

1120
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,199
is one of the leading states of you know

1121
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,519
regulating the industry here in the US

1122
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,519
but I guess the real disappointing thing

1123
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:21,400
is that like when you go to these Delta

1124
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:24,960
8 markets they're in all the Cannabis

1125
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:27,240
unfriendly States like Mississippi and

1126
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,079
Tennessee and Alabama

1127
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:33,519
and none of those states have cannabis

1128
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,798
programs because they sell Delta 8

1129
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:39,798
cartridges down at the gas station so

1130
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:42,079
why do they need cannabis right and and

1131
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:47,639
again Marcus when you look at so the guy

1132
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:51,119
who's on um future 4200 if the Watchers

1133
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:53,400
or the hash church people need to know

1134
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,280
there's a guy named uh iron trap that's

1135
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,960
the guy you want to look for and there's

1136
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,280
a couple threads in there that talks

1137
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,159
about him analyzing commercial products

1138
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,559
and he's actually looking for producers

1139
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:09,480
to say hey if you guys think you have a

1140
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:11,760
clean product send it to me I'll test it

1141
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,679
for you tell you what's in there and I

1142
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,880
guess some people again that's where the

1143
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,798
interaction goes bad he'll tell them you

1144
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,240
got all this crap in there you better

1145
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:24,838
change and they're just like [ __ ] you

1146
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:26,598
you know and that's where it ends so so

1147
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:30,239
listen you should invite him on to

1148
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:32,480
pastur if you get a chance I it well you

1149
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,959
you know the way 4200 Works no one

1150
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,000
really knows who the guy is now I can

1151
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,039
tell you come on like Sam though yeah he

1152
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,480
he he's kind of like Sam so Sam you

1153
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:45,079
probably know this guy he says he's been

1154
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,880
working in give you his phone number and

1155
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,240
address so

1156
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,480
everybody he says he's been working in

1157
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:54,598
can canabo science for 30 or 40 years

1158
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,838
and when you look at the content of his

1159
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:01,318
posts you realize this guy is is no joke

1160
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:04,039
right Colin he is no joke he totally

1161
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:06,199
knows he knows stuff there's a lot of

1162
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:09,318
haters on 4200 so it's a very

1163
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:10,838
interesting Forum but um sence like the

1164
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:13,000
art community though there's tons of

1165
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:16,480
haters you

1166
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,719
know fut2 through the weight of unknown

1167
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,760
you know it's called future 4200 it's a

1168
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:23,679
website and you can go there and look

1169
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,440
and just look at like I think the thread

1170
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:28,598
that I'm thinking of is something like

1171
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:31,480
there's a Sav compliant way to make

1172
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:35,119
Delta 8 and I think most of this chatter

1173
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:37,480
happened back in March and after that

1174
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,480
there was a lot of edicts that came out

1175
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,960
about delta8 including this ban in

1176
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,719
Colorado so who knows if again him going

1177
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,838
out and testing some of these products

1178
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:50,078
that are in this unregulated

1179
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:51,960
Marketplace help the FDA and DEA

1180
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,440
actually sort out okay well what are we

1181
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,920
going to do here you know and I think

1182
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,838
very clearly it seems like there's like

1183
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,200
about more than what two dozen states

1184
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:03,838
now Colin that have banned Del that was

1185
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:06,078
that's kind of my next question and like

1186
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,798
all right so because of this chemistry

1187
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:13,119
and this toxicologist that's really you

1188
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:16,000
know looking into this the the you know

1189
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,200
do you believe that's kind of uh you

1190
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,199
know the reason behind the the the

1191
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:22,519
regulation of delta8 and do you believe

1192
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:24,558
that this is going to continue and and

1193
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,400
do you believe it should continue more

1194
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,160
important well he's he's really getting

1195
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,000
down on on producers that don't have

1196
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:34,000
inhouse analytics to basically put some

1197
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,358
type of quality control mechanism on

1198
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,358
what they're

1199
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,920
making Hammer you could use a hammer to

1200
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,240
knock in a little tack or you could use

1201
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,760
a big freaking Sledgehammer so I think a

1202
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,679
lot of these people are using a big

1203
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,359
freaking sledgehammer and they're

1204
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:57,679
busting the molecule apart back into a

1205
00:55:54,358 --> 00:56:00,119
liol and some other degradation species

1206
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,118
I think paracine comes out of that and

1207
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,760
there's a few other things but it's

1208
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:06,559
interesting because again he's just

1209
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,520
looking for stuff that's in the

1210
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:12,359
marketplace and and all the producers

1211
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:14,400
are like scared of this guy because he's

1212
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:15,639
got the sophistication and the

1213
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,200
analytical

1214
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:20,000
instrumentation and Sam I bet you a

1215
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:22,480
dollar to a donut that you know who this

1216
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,358
dude is he's totally Anonymous in this

1217
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:29,159
forum but um he's been in canono science

1218
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:32,078
for a real long time and I can tell you

1219
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:34,920
that everything that he posts I read it

1220
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,920
almost it took me about two days worth

1221
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,480
of reading just to get through March

1222
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:42,838
21st of that single post because there

1223
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,240
like anybody who sends me

1224
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:48,798
9.95

1225
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:51,318
995 I'll send you his address his phone

1226
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:54,880
number Social Security number his bank

1227
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:56,920
account number yeah well the other

1228
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,838
thing the other thing that made him

1229
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,240
quite unpopular is he said that he's

1230
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:05,078
putting a binder together and going to

1231
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:07,679
send it to the DEA and the feds and you

1232
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:09,880
know that just oh instant hot button you

1233
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:12,480
know with a lot of people this guy's a

1234
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,760
douche he's a snitch you know [ __ ] this

1235
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,599
obvious if he could find things that are

1236
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:20,480
wrong with the substances being sold to

1237
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,119
Consumer a whistle needs to be blown

1238
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,960
period yes and he's he's the guy that's

1239
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:28,519
doing it and he says he's doing it

1240
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,358
because a his friends are being poisoned

1241
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:32,159
people like that he knows are being

1242
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:33,798
bringing things to him and saying hey

1243
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,679
can you look at this he looks at it and

1244
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:37,440
says there's poison in here so that's

1245
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,279
one thing and the other thing is he

1246
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,639
claims that there's a a safe and

1247
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:48,680
efficient process to make this and you

1248
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:50,798
need internal analytics to um to tell

1249
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:52,679
the quality of your products look Marcus

1250
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,358
I ask you all the time Marcus will show

1251
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:58,480
a nice piece of hash like that hash

1252
00:57:55,358 --> 00:58:00,239
meteor showed last week and I'll say hey

1253
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,599
what's the what's the cannaboid numbers

1254
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:05,519
on that how do you know what it is

1255
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,798
you're making if you can't test what it

1256
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,559
is you're making so I think it calls for

1257
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:13,519
in-house analytics but it also calls for

1258
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,359
a higher level of Competency than just a

1259
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:19,400
bunch of cowboys down south making this

1260
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:21,440
stuff in their freaking also too Mark to

1261
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:24,639
be honest Warehouse I think one of the

1262
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:28,679
main empathist behind Banning it in many

1263
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,679
states is the fact that it

1264
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:47,960
is it's like what [ __ ] what textbook

1265
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,798
did you read go read Paul malberg go

1266
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,639
read the people who actually figured out

1267
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:55,599
can abinoid biosynthesis it ends at

1268
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,558
Delta a THC okay or I'm sorry I'm sorry

1269
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,079
Delta

1270
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,359
it doesn't go to Delta 8 right so yeah I

1271
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,480
mean there's a lot of people on record

1272
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:06,798
who say that Delta 8 is is found in

1273
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,880
Trace Amounts in the plant and I laugh

1274
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:12,079
at that I think that's

1275
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,119
funny I've never seen it not true hey I

1276
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:18,000
wanted to cut to Josh I wanted to cut to

1277
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,358
Josh because I saw he had 13 seeds to a

1278
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,280
gram but then he went off camera and he

1279
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:26,519
found some bigger ones and came back 12

1280
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,960
per gram

1281
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:30,960
it it's a tie are those from

1282
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:38,599
Yan well it's it's a combination It's a

1283
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,960
combination of the vaval and the

1284
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:46,079
Chinese yeah it is I think it is from

1285
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:48,480
un which has the most biod the most

1286
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,160
biodiversity in all been everywhere

1287
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,318
around the world looking at cannabis

1288
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:58,118
seeds youan were the biggest I

1289
00:59:53,318 --> 01:00:03,159
found look it 12 seeds what 102 come on

1290
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:03,160
now I'll find more I'll make

1291
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,200
it I

1292
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:22,598
am I am in Canada so you'd have to ask

1293
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,559
about that you know you'd have to ask

1294
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:26,559
yeah look to see if there's pine because

1295
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:31,640
British is famous for

1296
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:32,880
okay now my small seeds were 800 plus to

1297
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:37,759
the

1298
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:39,920
gram wow that's insane what was that

1299
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:44,559
from was that

1300
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,559
tropical I collected it

1301
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:05,239
well those seeds I think are the answer

1302
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,799
to saving the forest I I believe you

1303
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:11,838
know so that's what I'm excited about I

1304
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:11,838
know that for Sav the

1305
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,280
forest

1306
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,159
one that's what's for saving the forest

1307
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,798
the big ones or the small

1308
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:27,199
ones the big

1309
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:30,519
ones what what I'm saying is the big

1310
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,519
ones are because in this case and maybe

1311
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:34,400
the small ones make giant trees too I

1312
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:37,199
just don't know I just know that these

1313
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,880
particular seeds are very large and they

1314
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:43,239
also produce some of the largest hemp

1315
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,200
plants ever you know that you'll see

1316
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:47,598
they're

1317
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:50,558
large stock they

1318
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:53,720
really it's not a big flower place it's

1319
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,000
a fiber and food seed thing so I believe

1320
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:56,439
that's going to be saving the forest

1321
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,519
industry because when you

1322
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,278
walk in an old gr Forest you're walking

1323
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:04,358
on four to five

1324
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:06,278
feet of trees that have been down for a

1325
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:08,920
thousand years there's no man-made

1326
01:02:06,278 --> 01:02:12,079
Forest that'll ever ever make it to that

1327
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:15,720
especially in a fire zone I mean if you

1328
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:17,278
wanted to create a nice forest and a

1329
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,439
fire zone you would have to cut the

1330
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:21,039
trees

1331
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,318
down which I don't agree with but you'd

1332
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,319
have to cut them down then you'd have to

1333
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,079
Buck them up and then you'd have to cut

1334
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,119
them slice them in half and then put

1335
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,440
them on the forest floor otherwise

1336
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:32,798
you're just stealing

1337
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,000
soil so like when you walk in an old

1338
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:38,318
growth forest the purpose of the trees

1339
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,119
growing really close to themselves is so

1340
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:41,920
they

1341
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:44,559
fall and if you want to speed up that

1342
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,318
process and you have to fall them put

1343
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,119
them on the ground and not take them out

1344
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:51,719
otherwise you'll NE there'll never be

1345
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,278
another large Forest there there's only

1346
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:56,239
so much dirt there's only so many

1347
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:57,880
needles that can fall so that's what's

1348
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,199
really important when you walk in a

1349
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:04,400
thousand- year old Forest you're walking

1350
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:07,159
on four to five feet of moss and humus

1351
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,838
and that's what makes us a humus being

1352
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,318
you know we're humus beings when we're

1353
01:03:08,838 --> 01:03:13,960
from the earth when we believe in

1354
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:16,599
natural immunity that's of dead trees

1355
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:20,838
right thank you yes that's what makes us

1356
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:24,318
carbon based microbial humus beings

1357
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:28,199
and responsible what what what what

1358
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:31,278
makes that really happen Josh it's fungi

1359
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:34,239
right it's the wood Decay fungi that

1360
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:38,000
decay to the stuff called White rot and

1361
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:40,239
brown rot and when it hits white rot it

1362
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,199
leaves brown behind and when it hits

1363
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:45,598
Brown rot it leaves white behind but

1364
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,798
yeah those fungi have figured out ways

1365
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:51,000
to completely

1366
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:53,960
mineralize content of the rotten

1367
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,880
wood start it starts with bacteria

1368
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,599
bacteria lead the way but then fungi com

1369
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,318
in after that and all those rotten trees

1370
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:05,119
that you find are yeah just the tops of

1371
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:09,079
what you're talking about that layer of

1372
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:13,680
humus that goes back for centuries of of

1373
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:17,278
of Fallen wood that and that fungi is

1374
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:20,118
here to save Humanity when I go to

1375
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:22,400
Oregon Washington or California it's

1376
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:24,720
very difficult to find

1377
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,960
polypores it's very difficult to find

1378
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:30,679
polypores because there's no trees

1379
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:34,000
rotting everything's managed there's no

1380
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:35,278
Branch to rot you've robbed the forest

1381
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
of

1382
01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:39,798
fungi and you've robbed the humanity of

1383
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,358
the

1384
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:49,110
fungi amazingly so it takes those dead

1385
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:50,239
and dying forests those nasty fire

1386
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:54,358
[Music]

1387
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:56,000
forests are what saves our life it might

1388
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:57,759
be that they want to cut down the old

1389
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,119
growth forest because when someone walks

1390
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:03,680
in an old growth forest their life has

1391
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:05,079
changed forever they oh my God what's oh

1392
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,639
my God the resonance oh my God

1393
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:09,960
everything's intact oh my God owls did

1394
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:11,480
you hear honey Ravens what's going on

1395
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:15,039
what's happening I've never seen life

1396
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:18,318
like this yeah we're losing diversity so

1397
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:21,400
it's very important that we put branches

1398
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:24,599
on the ground and let them rot it makes

1399
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,039
Greenery it makes Greenery you you take

1400
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:30,000
the branches away you lose the greenery

1401
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,520
I've seen Forest Green in the summer you

1402
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,679
know it's possible the only way it's

1403
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:35,519
possible is mulch love you got to over

1404
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:39,239
mulch the system and that's three

1405
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:42,000
branches so I think that's mulch

1406
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:43,558
love yeah Josh and one thing I want to

1407
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,798
add to what he was talking about when

1408
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:48,400
we're when we're cutting our firewood

1409
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:51,559
for the for the season we'll leave

1410
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:54,559
behind a little stack as an offering

1411
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:56,160
back along the roadways or along

1412
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,798
wherever in the forest we were were

1413
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,239
cutting and then now when we do our

1414
01:05:57,798 --> 01:06:03,838
walks back through the forest that's

1415
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:07,399
busting turkey tails and and all sorts

1416
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:09,239
of mushrooms on either end and lizards

1417
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,880
are coming out of the middle and you

1418
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:12,919
know we'll sometimes roll it back as

1419
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,358
like a you know just a little view into

1420
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:19,039
the Earth and um you see all that and I

1421
01:06:16,358 --> 01:06:21,759
was talking earlier about uh selling off

1422
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:25,079
part of our farm and uh we sold it this

1423
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:28,720
amazing amazing humus beings and um he

1424
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:28,720
was walking in the road and you said

1425
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:47,278
hey leave one so when you stack the next

1426
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:49,118
ones on it you can keep that cycle going

1427
01:06:47,278 --> 01:06:52,000
and then Harvest some for Hogle beds or

1428
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:54,240
whatever you might do but I just what

1429
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,599
you were saying Josh yeah another really

1430
01:06:54,239 --> 01:07:00,000
good idea is like if you if a person

1431
01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:03,278
lives near forests the unbelievable

1432
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,880
amount of of Slash that they burn in the

1433
01:07:03,278 --> 01:07:07,599
clear Cuts is it's

1434
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,680
mind-blowing there's so much material

1435
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,920
left over so much raw material left over

1436
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:15,919
by the loggers and all they're going to

1437
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,798
do is put it in the air so really like

1438
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,440
if you have a truck and a trailer like

1439
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:22,759
an incredible amount of of raw materials

1440
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,159
can be gathered out of

1441
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,760
clearcuts and you should do it because

1442
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:28,920
you're not stealing future soil from the

1443
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,680
clearcut because all they're going to do

1444
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,440
is stack it up and burn it which is just

1445
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,440
mindblowing and then they try and

1446
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:37,079
replant a forest

1447
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,480
with yeah it's so frustrating but yeah

1448
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:41,200
so yeah you you know like like you said

1449
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,358
Craig there's this balance you know like

1450
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:48,038
we're taking some we're leaving some but

1451
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:51,558
we and the mindset of I think we need to

1452
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:54,039
Rew environments I think we need to Rew

1453
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:58,880
our cannabis garden I think we need to

1454
01:07:54,039 --> 01:08:02,920
Rew our Genie ology I to have viruses

1455
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:06,318
because without viruses our our immune

1456
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:08,039
system cannot evolve by stopping

1457
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:11,318
ourselves from getting sick we're

1458
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:14,960
stopping our body another muscle the

1459
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:14,960
immune system from working

1460
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,679
properly before we do any of this to be

1461
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:23,759
honest we need to lower the world

1462
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:26,039
population because the world cannot

1463
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:29,399
support the amount of people we have if

1464
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:32,439
we had one tenth of the amount of people

1465
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:35,198
we have maybe the world could be okay

1466
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:38,479
but in a substainable way we got too

1467
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:41,559
many and it's only going to be more well

1468
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:44,838
we live in a scarcity environment so

1469
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:47,039
yeah based off the style of life that we

1470
01:08:44,838 --> 01:08:50,039
live as eight billion people on the

1471
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:53,198
planet based off that style based off

1472
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:56,960
what's been handed to us we live in

1473
01:08:53,198 --> 01:09:00,000
scarcity it's not necessary we can live

1474
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:02,279
in abundance if everyone participated in

1475
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,039
the concept that we're all trying to

1476
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:10,040
better ourselves and make more food if

1477
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:13,238
everyone grew a little bit in their yard

1478
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:17,519
on their roof on their Terrace somewhere

1479
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:20,678
something it's possible for us to live

1480
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,880
in abundance even with eight billion

1481
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:25,399
people on the

1482
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:29,440
Earth yeah we have we have an abundance

1483
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:33,079
of scarcity and it is driving the market

1484
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:36,919
literally they make us feel a shortage

1485
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:39,079
and then it just drives and drives and

1486
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:41,798
drives and without regenerative

1487
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:43,399
agriculture and regenerative soils you

1488
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:46,319
can talk about

1489
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:49,000
soil science all day long you can talk

1490
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:52,359
about Tarpin you can talk about sensory

1491
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,679
stuff but 95% of the beers out there are

1492
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:56,880
coated in glyphosate you know most of

1493
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:59,880
the wine is so great you've got all the

1494
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:03,920
sensory down but the base of the sensory

1495
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:06,560
is is tarnished it's it's toxic so

1496
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:10,480
really like the first thing is how do we

1497
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:13,360
put Health back into the system how do

1498
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:17,079
we put Health back in now we can talk

1499
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:19,799
about tpin now we can talk about sensory

1500
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:23,079
and what the but if we're analyzing

1501
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,920
sensory while we're getting poisoned by

1502
01:10:23,079 --> 01:10:27,279
glyphosate then it's it's it's just not

1503
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:30,158
a system that that recognizable it's

1504
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,198
it's a broken system so I I constantly

1505
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,839
will

1506
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:36,359
continuously

1507
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:41,199
promote regenerative lifestyle and and

1508
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:43,839
soils and regenerative style cultivation

1509
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:45,678
and polyculture and permaculture because

1510
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,400
I want to survive I want to be one of

1511
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,359
those people that

1512
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:53,839
survive Marcus I have a question for you

1513
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:56,519
did you hear from Max monrose about the

1514
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:00,279
other type of Turing he

1515
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,199
discovered I mean the other uh tricomes

1516
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:04,639
excuse

1517
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:07,319
me no I didn't I only sent my message

1518
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:09,280
late last night so I didn't hear back

1519
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:10,960
from him but yeah he did say that he was

1520
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:12,519
going to come back and share that with

1521
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,600
us as well as I think there was

1522
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,600
something else too I forget he he said

1523
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,719
he grafted Hops and cannabis together

1524
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:22,320
and had oh that's right no he didn't

1525
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:26,520
graft it he bred it he crossed it okay

1526
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:29,119
right right I I was quite IAL but if

1527
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,880
somebody did it I want to see it well

1528
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:33,279
you're the doubting Thomas and that's

1529
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,760
why you got to touch the incorporeal

1530
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:35,759
body of

1531
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:43,440
Christ well uh I'm very interested also

1532
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:47,280
if he thinks he has a different kind of

1533
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:49,399
a triome uh I'm I'm very

1534
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,920
interested well there have been quite a

1535
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:54,119
few posts and even Ed Rosenthal picked

1536
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,480
on up on this recently there is a guy

1537
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:58,039
who posts and I don't know know if

1538
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:59,919
they're just mutants but he posted a

1539
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:03,198
picture of a triome the other day that

1540
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,600
had like six little heads on top of it I

1541
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:07,158
wish I could remember his name because

1542
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:11,560
he's posting all sorts of very very high

1543
01:12:07,158 --> 01:12:14,559
level is that in a variety as uh I have

1544

01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:26,000
don't know enough about it but um it's

1549
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:29,279
definitely um unique and I wish I wish I

1550

1561
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:08,198
look smaller than the head that would

1562
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:10,400
normally be on a stock of that size nice

1563

all morning so I thought I'd just pop on

1586
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:15,639
and I always think I can hop on with a

1587
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,639
joint and a coffee and water and talk

1588

the Lush roots and the Gaia green to

1602
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:06,399
kind of help push through some of

1603
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,719
this but I'm just really impressed man

1608
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,800
weeks ago and I was kind of working on

1609
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,679
timing it and I I broke my shear pin so

1610
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,159
I got to run to the hard hardware

1611
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:28,760
store and get a new shear pin so that's

1612
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:28,759
why I've got my dep on on half of

1613

me a nice yield I'm excited that plant

1618
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,000
looks like straight up like a [ __ ]

1619
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,199
canopy yeah dude look look at this big

1620
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
one back here this uh can you see that

1621
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:56,238
big girl I'll walk over on one of these

1622
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,560
planks oh I see her back there in the

1623
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:01,158
shade yeah in the shade this big uh

1624
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:05,520
Black liim from Kevin

1625
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:08,559
JRE so I'm this is six feet right

1626
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,199
here she's seven eight feet tall we just

1627
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:14,000
started flower about three days ago

1628
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:15,719
she's GNA get way up there up lights you

1629
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,079
use light meters to figure out what kind

1630
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:18,439
of light your plants are getting there

1631
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:20,279
because Johnny B came over here the

1632
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:24,279
other day with this like utterly

1633
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:25,599
ridiculous multi th000 light meter um

1634
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:27,279
maybe he can tell tell us a little bit

1635
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,280
about that later but do you do you use

1636
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:32,319
anything like that Josh just to I don't

1637
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:34,158
I can't afford one but um kind of the

1638
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:36,639
way so in the green houses we build the

1639
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,960
light system to be a supplement not to

1640
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,960
be a

1641
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:45,399
fullon these lights on there's a ton of

1642
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:47,960
them I'm only putting in about 20% of

1643
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:50,319
what the the plants need 20

1644
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,359
30% um if I had like the depth on I

1645
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:54,359
wouldn't be able to grow a good crop

1646
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:56,960
with just these lights are you in BC I'm

1647
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:59,719
just below I'm I'm On the Border um in

1648
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:03,000
bla bir Bay damn maybe I can meet you I

1649
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:06,239
could just pass the meter across yeah

1650
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,520
toss sitting on the corner know and you

1651
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:11,839
can pick it up and leave it in there and

1652
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:13,560
we'll meet the next day this one's the

1653
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:18,039
Congo though from up there the Roberts

1654
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:20,000
Creek oh [ __ ] Congo B seeing the shade

1655
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:21,880
and I'm looking at I've been doing this

1656
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,359
around my own yard by putting plants and

1657
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,480
Solo cups at different parts of

1658
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,158
different spectrums underneath the trees

1659
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:28,638
and looking at different Reds and stuff

1660
01:17:27,158 --> 01:17:32,198
so I'm having a lot of fun with this

1661
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:34,400
right now um just ahe in two minutes

1662
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:36,678
it's going to be 420 and Cate Rue so I

1663
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:39,000
have a 420 clock right beside me so I'm

1664
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:41,199
kind of like but we'll just keep going

1665
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,960
here sorry I was just uh on the light

1666
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:46,158
kick um so I'm putting on this dep and

1667
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,920
and I built this greenhouse oriented e

1668
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,799
east to west right not north to south

1669
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:53,199
because you know my my version of

1670
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,119
regenerative is that I grow year round

1671
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:57,638
and I only support people within 100

1672
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:59,960
miles of me and that that's kind of how

1673
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:01,679
I i' I've Quantified this whole thing so

1674
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:04,719
I built this whole system to be a year

1675
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:07,359
round greenhouse and producing the cold

1676
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:09,079
part of the year um and I had another

1677
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:11,359
another local flower guy come over and

1678
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:13,920
he's like what's up with that big tube

1679
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:16,198
if you can look up here I have a big I

1680
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:19,239
call it the the light the dong of

1681
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:21,879
Life uh but it's a big 36 inch tube that

1682
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:24,919
just distributes the air from the top of

1683
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:26,679
the greenhouse into the whole system and

1684
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,920
then I and I and I just like no man I'm

1685
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:30,840
not it's never been a problem I've been

1686
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,319
running this dong for five years and and

1687
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:36,560
I start talking to him real confidently

1688
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:38,158
about uh the understory and and where PL

1689
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,960
cannabis is in succession and how it's

1690
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,238
kind of an understory plant and and the

1691
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,079
diffusion and I start talking about

1692
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,039
rattle and all this stuff and you know

1693
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:48,359
just to describe it better I have a two

1694
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:50,359
layers of poly here and when you blow

1695
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:52,079
them up it creates a light diffusion and

1696
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:54,839
it reduces the brightness in the

1697
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:56,519
greenhouse but it also spreads it out

1698
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,079
and you can see it on the plant canopy

1699
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,360
if you go you know if I walk from one

1700
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:01,920
Greenhouse with the double layer poly

1701
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:03,960
into another one with a single layer

1702
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,279
poly you can totally and in then outside

1703
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,960
you can totally see the sharp light you

1704
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:11,439
can see how it affects the foliage um

1705
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,158
and I've also kind of [ __ ] around with

1706
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:16,119
putting some plants in the edge of my

1707
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:17,319
forest and and kind of watched in stages

1708
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:19,800
and watched the ones that maybe were a

1709
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:22,079
little bit farther back how they did and

1710
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,039
I'm fully convinced that that the plants

1711
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:27,439
do like a little bit less light a little

1712
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:29,439
little bit more diffus use light um but

1713
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:32,079
then I got this this uh dep on here and

1714
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:34,039
it creat some serious shadows and so now

1715
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:36,600
I'm like oh man what have I

1716
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:38,000
done um I kind of just say a that just

1717
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,880
to bring up the topic about about

1718
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,920
lighting and and diffusion and since you

1719
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,239
were talking about it you know I don't

1720
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,719
know what what anybody else has dug in

1721
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:47,799
there in you know working in the

1722
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,639
diffused and less bright world you know

1723
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,840
indoors is it's much different idea

1724
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:53,319
you're kind of just trying to hit a

1725
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:56,639
specific Target you know and maintain

1726
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:56,639
that for an amount of time

1727
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:03,360
I've SE I just had some uh I had some

1728
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:06,960
results with some indoor back of the

1729
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:09,279
room changes with a strain my gas mask

1730
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:13,639
excuse me actually seem to have done

1731
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:16,079
better kind of even mossier stinkier

1732
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:19,760
even little bigger on the flowers in the

1733
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,760
back end of the room

1734
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:30,960
I like the light depths even being able

1735
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,000
to drop the tarp if you got a hot time

1736
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,920
during planting you can drop down

1737
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,439
halfway and kind of use it for your own

1738
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,960
like shade transitional shading at the

1739
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:41,479
peak key to the day and it's because

1740
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:46,000
it's been kind of hot in Maine even the

1741
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:49,718
last week over 80 so

1742
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:55,600
yeah I have a question I I'll ask

1743
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:59,560
um the uh you the farmers here uh do you

1744
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:03,039
guys think or suspect that there's um

1745
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:04,520
anything to do with uh climate change

1746
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:08,519
that has

1747
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:12,040
impacted the atmosphere which has caused

1748
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:14,760
lighting to be different for us growing

1749
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:16,000
cannabis now in this time period versus

1750
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,960
what the cannabis

1751
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,800
plant might have been typically um used

1752
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:25,880
to uh working with on on Earth prior to

1753
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,480
humanity doing what we've done up until

1754
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:31,119
this

1755
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:33,439
point I well quick the first thing came

1756
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:36,519
on my head was the fires you know two

1757
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:38,198
weeks in August with with h no sun when

1758
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,920
I'm when you're making flowers through

1759
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:42,238
you know into September that's a big

1760
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,039
deal um that's a real crucial transition

1761
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:47,638
time and and the West Coast folks feel

1762
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:49,920
that pretty hard um the other thing I

1763
01:21:47,639 --> 01:21:53,359
was I was thinking on the back end was

1764
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:55,480
the almost the positive effect if you

1765
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:57,920
look at it from a a

1766
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:59,599
greedy humanistic perspective that that

1767
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,440
we're able to to cultivate in places

1768
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,360
where we weren't able to cultivate

1769
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:05,559
before

1770
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,238
um it's a really big interesting

1771
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:10,960
question on my mind I I've I've had the

1772
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:12,158
hard go of it here on my farm in large

1773
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,439
part with my neighbor some neighbor

1774
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:15,719
conflicts that have made it really

1775
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:17,879
miserable where many of times I've been

1776
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:20,079
wanting to give up and and and dreamt

1777
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,600
about moving away to another place and

1778
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,840
and and thought where would I do it and

1779
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,360
then I start kind of looking into what

1780
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,199
the future looks like like in different

1781
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:30,839
places and I'm like God damn I'm in a

1782
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:32,599
one of the best spots to really be going

1783
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,800
forward

1784
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,159
um I don't know just kind of the

1785
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,000
thoughts that I have when I'm thinking

1786
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,519
about how these things things are going

1787
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,319
to be in the future and water is a big

1788
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,320
fear for me even though I I'm in an

1789
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:46,519
abundant Water Place um I I think that

1790
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:49,439
that the whole thing is going to be a

1791
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:50,840
real real big issue coming going forward

1792
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:53,919
with what companies getting are getting

1793
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:55,319
into charging and Etc sorry I cut

1794
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,399
someone else off all that whoever else

1795
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:58,399
was going to pop in

1796
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:03,800
go all good I was just kind of agreeing

1797
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:05,759
with you I'm definitely seeing some

1798
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:08,119
changes and I'm seeing hotter Sun back

1799
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:11,039
into Maine here than I thought I would

1800
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:13,158
see coming from the west coast and I got

1801
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:16,560
a big openup property here so I'm full

1802
01:23:13,158 --> 01:23:19,879
spread of Sunrise to sunet mostly here

1803
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,400
you know but uh seeing bigger yields and

1804
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:25,239
the and the Earth seems drier this year

1805
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:28,198
here really dry compared it's not fire

1806
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:30,519
dry like the West Coast but it's kicking

1807
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:32,479
up dust my pwns are dropping like a foot

1808
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:35,600
and a half already and it's been a hot

1809
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:37,959
May uh one of the big things I've seen

1810
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,199
that's kind of like driving the dogs

1811
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,679
nuts driving us nuts the bugs have

1812
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:45,359
kicked up the black flies early

1813
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:47,679
mosquitoes uh luckily the dragon flies

1814
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:50,119
came in about a month earlier because

1815
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:52,079
and I you know the the change in climate

1816
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:54,238
and I don't know if that's just a

1817
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:56,760
two-year blip that we're seeing but here

1818
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:59,359
as an outdoor farmer in Maine is

1819
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,119
definitely hotter drier kind of drought

1820
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:04,279
conditions coming in and I'm seeing a

1821
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:07,039
kick up of bugs that seem to bring in

1822
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:09,039
the insect environment pretty hard you

1823
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:11,880
know they haven't been plaguing us but

1824
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:14,000
there's definitely waves of of bugs

1825
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,039
we've gotten a bunch of the corn borers

1826
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,880
in the last few years that seem to have

1827
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:21,039
come in and you know anyway that's what

1828
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:24,000
I'm seeing some stuff

1829
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:27,840
here yeah I would lean in and uh offer

1830
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,760
this thought uh to your question Max uh

1831
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:32,239
I don't think the cannabis plant itself

1832
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:34,800
is going to have any trouble with what

1833
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:37,198
we're doing to the environment uh

1834
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,900
because it's dealt with all kinds of

1835
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:41,019
crazy [ __ ]

1836
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:41,019
[Music]

1837
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:46,840
in is what's going to be the effect on

1838
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:49,839
humans and the Cannabis industry if you

1839
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:53,239
will the opportunity for folks to work

1840
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:56,639
with this plant create product and uh

1841
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:59,759
live a life that we all enjoy uh and I

1842
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:02,480
think that's a really different question

1843
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,400
um and I think that Josh and Kelly with

1844
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:07,238
the dragonfly Earth medicine Concepts

1845
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:10,198
around regenerative practices certainly

1846
01:25:07,238 --> 01:25:12,118
point to one of many different things

1847
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:15,678
that we as humans are going to have to

1848
01:25:12,118 --> 01:25:18,599
do in order to preserve something like

1849
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:20,719
the life we currently enjoy uh going

1850
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,560
forward over the next few generations of

1851
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:26,639
humans I have grandchildren and I think

1852
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:29,880
this is the real issue of our time I

1853
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:32,880
I've been a a fervent cannabis advocate

1854
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:34,118
for many years I still am but I really

1855
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,520
think what we're doing to the

1856
01:25:34,118 --> 01:25:39,118
environment that we live in that we all

1857
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:42,600
share as humans is the real question of

1858
01:25:39,118 --> 01:25:44,359
our time and uh so circling all the way

1859
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,719
back to your question Max yeah I think

1860
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:48,000
it's going to be a real issue going

1861
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:49,039
forward not just for cannabis but for

1862
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,760
growing

1863
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:54,000
food for growing food is going to be an

1864
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,520
issue for us going forward and that's my

1865
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,760
thought I think the Cannabis plan will

1866
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:01,560
be fine thank you I'm con concerned

1867
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,480
about the air quality too um you know

1868
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,280
for for for growing just to tag onto

1869
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:07,559
that that food thought you

1870
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:08,759
know that that the quality of the air

1871
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,280
that you were going to be prod we're

1872
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,480
have to you know grow to grow healthy

1873
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:13,639
food we're going to have to possibly

1874
01:26:11,479 --> 01:26:15,678
grow in green houses and filter the air

1875
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:18,079
and have cleaned air you know places to

1876
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:21,199
grow our healthy food and our medicines

1877
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:21,198
is is a fear that I

1878
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:25,800
have yeah and I I'll just throw one last

1879
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,039
thing and I know that some of the

1880
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,520
farmers that are in this group here as

1881
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:31,719
well as listening on the to the hash

1882
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:35,239
Church

1883
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:37,399
broadcast uh may have come to recognize

1884
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:40,799
that it's actually more of a challenge

1885
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:42,638
to grow food than it is to grow cannabis

1886
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,360
especially if you're trying to grow at

1887
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:48,319
scale um that's been my experience at

1888
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:51,599
least uh just talk about germinating

1889
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:53,759
seeds of food crops uh as compared to

1890
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,560
germinating cannabis seeds and I'll

1891
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,560
leave it there thank

1892
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:03,079
you same with producing seeds uh celery

1893
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:06,840
and other seeds take two years to

1894
01:27:03,079 --> 01:27:09,719
produce a crop of so it's you know it's

1895
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,719
more work for

1896
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:21,399
sure yeah one by the way I here's

1897
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:25,118
one another one I got from Russia it's

1898
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:25,118
Master breeder

1899
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:30,839
congratulations Sam you are known all

1900
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:30,839
over the

1901
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:35,359
world master breeder that's what

1902
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:37,198
everyone calls themselves at LPS now

1903
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,399
they've turned that into a bad a bad

1904
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,919
word well Master Growers sometimes I

1905
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:44,238
think it should be Master baders but uh

1906
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:47,679
that's really

1907
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:50,399
cool um I guess here's another good

1908
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:55,440
question uh on the lighting perspective

1909
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:58,679
um for a room of intelligent Growers is

1910
01:27:55,439 --> 01:28:01,599
um I've heard some people say before

1911
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:04,920
that uh there are varieties that have

1912
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:10,280
spent so much time growing

1913
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:13,000
indoors that they are indoor varieties

1914
01:28:10,279 --> 01:28:16,800
meaning transferring them

1915
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,198
Outdoors they either don't do as well or

1916
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:24,800
can't handle the intensity of the

1917
01:28:20,198 --> 01:28:26,479
outdoor environment um because they've

1918
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,440
more or less

1919
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:32,799
evolved uh you know over a 10year period

1920
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:35,238
to be in the in the environment of a of

1921
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:38,560
an indoor space do you guys think

1922
01:28:35,238 --> 01:28:40,118
there's any amount of Truth to that um

1923
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,560
do you think that there are some plants

1924
01:28:40,118 --> 01:28:46,679
that after spending too much time

1925
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:49,560
indoors um H has a change uh in in the

1926
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:53,039
plant's life and cycle that's noticeable

1927
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:56,360
when you were to to put it outside so um

1928
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:59,519
not not from single year of selection

1929
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:01,920
but if you grew a big crop and selected

1930
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,480
the most leaning towards indoor

1931
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:07,239
performance and you did that for 10

1932
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:11,439
Generations in a row then you would have

1933
01:29:07,238 --> 01:29:11,439
made one small step in that

1934
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,760
direction I kind of see

1935
01:29:18,039 --> 01:29:25,238
Craig how's that there we go um yeah I I

1936
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,800
resonate with what um was saying and

1937
01:29:25,238 --> 01:29:29,959
I've witnessed it um when I've been

1938
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:33,600
giving been given some indoor seeds

1939
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:36,600
specifically from from that uh side of

1940
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,600
things

1941
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:48,559
and more Airy or more bushy than my

1942
01:29:45,238 --> 01:29:50,959
liking and the plant Canabis plant

1943
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:55,679
specifically I feel is a really quick

1944
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:58,520
learner one one season of reading the

1945
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:01,760
next year Boom the the structure has

1946
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:03,119
changed it can support itself and then

1947
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,960
you know what Sam was saying we do that

1948
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:07,479
a couple years in a row and the

1949
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:11,480
phenotypic knowledge starts being passed

1950
01:30:07,479 --> 01:30:14,000
down and um it it it learned so quickly

1951
01:30:11,479 --> 01:30:17,158
and and that's a really good uh thing to

1952
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,920
talk about I witnessed it probably five

1953
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:20,638
years

1954
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,880
ago um I forget what the cultivar was

1955
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:25,719
but you know folks that would even tour

1956
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,719
my garden would would go what is that it

1957
01:30:25,719 --> 01:30:30,079
smells

1958
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:33,319
amazing but it didn't have the structure

1959
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:37,279
to stand where where it uh was in the

1960
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:39,599
garden it needed to be inside and um it

1961
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:41,759
took one season to learn unlearn that or

1962
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,840
to learn the new

1963
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,880
process this

1964
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:51,440
winter excuse go

1965
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:56,039
ahead Max what is the new type of Tricom

1966
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:59,678
and the uh you do you have photos of the

1967
01:30:56,039 --> 01:31:03,118
of the hot pie bread with uh

1968
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:06,800
cannabis I I do um I do have photos of

1969
01:31:03,118 --> 01:31:06,799
that stuff

1970
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:11,800
um I didn't prepare them because I

1971
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:15,839
didn't know that that's what we were

1972
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:19,440
doing so um I guess I could uh see if I

1973
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:22,199
could quickly open a few files also

1974
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:24,799
don't know how much I uh I should share

1975
01:31:22,198 --> 01:31:27,039
before my new book comes out

1976
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,880
um what about the new triome can you

1977
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:33,198
give it its name yeah I can well I can

1978
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:35,920
tell you what I want to name it um and

1979
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:38,118
apparently I I have the opportunity to

1980
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:42,039
name it

1981
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:44,399
um the uh what I'm not going to do is

1982
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:47,600
I'm not going to name it after

1983
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:50,039
myself um what I thought would be

1984
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:53,679
appropriate from a naming perspective

1985
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:55,519
though was something in alignment um

1986
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:59,560
that at uh

1987
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:02,639
mulam uh where he came up with

1988
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:06,560
anandamide um the Sanskrit word for

1989
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:09,520
Bliss um which also has some Hebrew

1990
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:13,800
translations and iterations and has some

1991
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:18,760
biblical Essence in in nature um in some

1992
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:23,079
senses um uh I am Jewish and I also

1993
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:24,360
study uh the esoteric world I love uh

1994
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:27,439
cabala

1995
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:31,118
all that kind of stuff and so um with

1996
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:35,319
that thought process I asked what would

1997
01:32:31,118 --> 01:32:38,960
the seventh be or mean in a Hebrew word

1998
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:41,799
or Essence um and in a in a meaningful

1999
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:46,439
way because this would be the seventh

2000
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:48,960
type of triome found um we have two

2001
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:50,759
types of non- glandular tricomes

2002
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,239
unicellular and

2003
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:58,320
cystolithic we have uh bulbus simp Le

2004
01:32:54,238 --> 01:33:01,279
and bulbus complex you have cile and you

2005
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:05,719
have capitate stocked um and so that's

2006
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:08,079
six and so this would be the seven and

2007
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:11,679
uh so this from a name perspective in

2008
01:33:08,079 --> 01:33:14,158
Hebrew there's uh the name in Hebrew

2009
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:16,760
that means seven and seven from a

2010
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:20,198
miracle perspective is

2011
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:23,119
nessia and this triome is also capitate

2012
01:33:20,198 --> 01:33:26,399
stocked it has a very long stock and it

2013
01:33:23,118 --> 01:33:29,559
has a a a head but instead of a mushroom

2014
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:32,679
shaped head it's an upside down teardrop

2015
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:36,320
shaped head and all of those

2016
01:33:32,679 --> 01:33:39,319
tricomes they're a teardrop shaped head

2017
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:42,479
so it's it's got a really interesting uh

2018
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:44,880
roundness to it with kind of like a a

2019
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:48,839
point and a do drop that comes off of it

2020
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:51,960
and then the stock itself is a third of

2021
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,760
the width of a capitate stocked

2022
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:57,079
Tricom um so there're these really thin

2023
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:00,520
long stocks with these do drop shaped

2024
01:33:57,079 --> 01:34:03,319
heads off the end of them um and so I

2025
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:07,119
would name it capitate stocks

2026
01:34:03,319 --> 01:34:10,399
nessia um the seventh the seventh triome

2027
01:34:07,118 --> 01:34:14,079
and to me it's a miracle that no one

2028
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:16,519
else has scientifically you know put the

2029
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:19,439
put a white paper on this yet and and

2030
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:22,719
Max did you find it in all varieties of

2031
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:24,279
cannabis or just particular lean towards

2032
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:28,639
a particular

2033
01:34:24,279 --> 01:34:33,198
uh wide Leafs skinny Leaf equatorial

2034
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:36,600
Northern so um I'm not sure of the the

2035
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:41,198
origin of the geography of the plants at

2036
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:44,639
all um we I can confirm that I found

2037
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:47,638
them in both H types and marijuana

2038
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:50,639
types um

2039
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:50,639
and

2040
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:56,198
um the

2041
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,480
I can show you a picture if you want

2042
01:34:56,198 --> 01:34:58,519
I'll I'll find a picture of one I'll

2043
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:02,158
show it to you right now since I'm

2044
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:06,760
talking about it the the the thing is is

2045
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:11,920
they are very very very very rare you

2046
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:15,920
just rarely see them um and so if you

2047
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:19,560
have Instagram and follow these

2048
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:23,158
incredible um artists that do incredible

2049
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,560
triome photography you see hundreds if

2050
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:29,039
not

2051
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:32,440
thousands of microscopic shots of of

2052
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:35,238
tricomes um on a weekly or monthly basis

2053
01:35:32,439 --> 01:35:38,359
and at least I do and when you look at

2054
01:35:35,238 --> 01:35:40,238
these tricomes and very very up close

2055
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:44,519
these images are just

2056
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:47,238
incredible um I'm always hunting for

2057
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:52,280
these special tricomes that pop up

2058
01:35:47,238 --> 01:35:55,359
rarely and um when I do find

2059
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:57,599
one uh and then I have an opportunity to

2060
01:35:55,359 --> 01:36:00,519
acquire the flower and I'm able to

2061
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:02,719
really look at it myself you do find

2062
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:07,080
those other Tricom within it and it's

2063
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:09,520
extremely exciting um and then uh apart

2064
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:14,079
from that

2065
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:16,520
um I have found multiple new types of

2066
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:20,600
tricomes uh some of which are tricomes

2067
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:23,040
that are non- glandular that are four to

2068
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:25,520
five times longer than most of the other

2069
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:28,639
Tricom so these very long curly q

2070
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:31,040
tricomes that are they're just kind of

2071
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:34,400
outrageous um and then I've also found

2072
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:37,399
Tricom where the glandular head is in

2073
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:39,839
the center of the stock so instead of

2074
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:44,799
the head being on the end of the stock

2075
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,800
there's a stock then there's a gland

2076
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:01,639
crazy tricomes Max is finding are

2077
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:03,158
actually novel tricomes like who's the

2078
01:37:01,639 --> 01:37:06,560
judge over here when it comes to this

2079
01:37:03,158 --> 01:37:09,599
kind of stuff um and that would be a

2080
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:13,440
good question to ask um if you know the

2081
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:16,400
work of Paul mulberg he's a scientist

2082
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:18,759
that has done cannabis cannabinoid and

2083
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:22,719
triome research for the United States

2084
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:25,400
federal government for over 30 years and

2085
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:30,039
um his young younger lab texts and lab

2086
01:37:25,399 --> 01:37:30,039
assistants one of which is

2087
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:07,000
um and so bringing them in a live uh um

2088
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:09,880
plant with these tricomes will give them

2089
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,880
the opportunity to dissect the tricomes

2090
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:15,000
microscopically for their anatomy and so

2091
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:18,760
you have to actually pull the anatomy

2092
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:22,760
out of the tricomes and lay them these

2093
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:27,079
microscopic uh glands out um almost like

2094
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:31,639
you're doing a um it's not a

2095
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:31,639
biop when you uh take apart a dead

2096

here well yeah Ma Max we we've talked

2102
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:56,719
about Paul malberg before I think

2103
01:38:52,960 --> 01:39:01,039
actually um uh Sam don't you know Dr Kim

2104
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:04,118
or I I know I've met Dr Kim I know Dr

2105
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:07,359
malberg I financed their lab for five

2106
01:39:04,118 --> 01:39:10,799
years of work with cannabis with Carl

2107
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:14,000
hilling there you go so your comment

2108
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:17,159
your comments Max your comments are just

2109
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:20,158
right on though and centered on you know

2110
01:39:17,158 --> 01:39:23,439
the wonderful research that he did and

2111
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:26,479
the Legacy that like through Dr Kim and

2112
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:26,479
I'm sorry for cutting you

2113
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,520
off well we stand on the shoulders of

2114
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:47,440
giants including Sam so you know where

2115
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:50,360
we are today and what we can do with the

2116
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:52,678
plant and cannaboid Science in general

2117
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:54,639
are really due to a handful of

2118
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:57,480
individuals that walk the face of the

2119
01:39:54,639 --> 01:40:00,880
Earth one of them who Graces our panel

2120
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:05,479
today but others like Paul malberg and

2121
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:07,840
Raphael michul and Roger Adams and um

2122
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:11,079
and those guys Canada Ernie

2123
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:13,480
small yeah I I I always think of those

2124
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:14,399
those Brits who first made distillate

2125
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:18,439
back in the

2126
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:21,879
1890s and called it called it yeah no

2127
01:40:18,439 --> 01:40:25,399
this was way before Adams This was um

2128
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:28,000
easterwood East easterfield Spivy and

2129
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:29,799
wood wood Spivy and easterfield the

2130
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,840
first people to isolate

2131
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:35,920
THC so um yeah man I mean we stand on

2132
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,920
the shoulders of all these people Max

2133
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:41,639
and it's just like when you read and and

2134
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:44,359
through Open Access you could read most

2135
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:47,039
of malbergs research in fact there's a

2136
01:40:44,359 --> 01:40:49,759
website that actually has a list of all

2137
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:53,479
Paul malbergs papers and there's like 30

2138
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:54,599
of them I mean it's it's amazing

2139
01:40:53,479 --> 01:40:57,759
go

2140
01:40:54,599 --> 01:41:00,119
um thank you and uh I was just going to

2141
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,880
ask bubble man if you can grace me with

2142
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:03,960
the ability to share my screen I can

2143
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:06,560
show some of these tricomes I'm talking

2144
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:10,239
about wow that's amazing it is showing

2145
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:13,800
your screen that's not my

2146
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:15,759
screen whose photos are those that's

2147
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:18,599
that's Zoom Gardens and I'll share them

2148
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:21,360
afterwards he has the most incredible

2149
01:41:18,599 --> 01:41:24,039
insane mutant macro photographs of

2150
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:26,198
cannabis so while Max was talking about

2151
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:27,760
this I was going I mean that last one I

2152
01:41:26,198 --> 01:41:30,198
just showed was like a Tricom that

2153
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:32,520
literally had stocks all inside the

2154
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:34,479
stock but they're also tricomes growing

2155
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:36,239
off the stock so I just figured it

2156
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:37,919
suited the conversation but I will

2157
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:41,158
figure out going in right now and

2158
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:43,239
gracing you with the ability to share

2159
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:46,198
the screen I don't know why it sets it

2160
01:41:43,238 --> 01:41:48,638
up so only the host can share but you

2161
01:41:46,198 --> 01:41:51,279
you should be good to go now Max all

2162
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:55,560
right so

2163
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:59,479
um this is in my book book interpreting

2164
01:41:55,560 --> 01:42:03,320
um and if you look on the upper right

2165
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:06,839
hand screen um this was the

2166
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:10,719
first time I actually ever saw the

2167
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:13,199
seventh Tricom type um was when I was

2168
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:16,439
sifting through triome photography from

2169
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:18,598
my buddy uh schale he used to live in

2170
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:21,479
Denver um and I was actually at his

2171
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:23,319
house uh just going through his pictures

2172
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:26,439
because I was going to purchase some for

2173
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:28,439
company for our website and uh for stuff

2174
01:42:26,439 --> 01:42:31,719
like my book

2175
01:42:28,439 --> 01:42:33,719
and um it wasn't until after I actually

2176
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:35,079
uh bought this photograph from him and I

2177
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:37,039
brought it home and I was looking at it

2178
01:42:35,079 --> 01:42:38,920
again and I saw the it was really the

2179
01:42:37,039 --> 01:42:43,198
stock that stood out to me more than

2180
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:45,920
anything else um and you can't see the

2181
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:48,960
its little unicorn horn that kind of

2182
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:52,279
pulls off the end as well on this photo

2183
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:56,319
but um this was the first image that I

2184
01:42:52,279 --> 01:43:01,319
ever had of these and I have uh many

2185
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:03,238
more images of them um and you know we

2186
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:06,198
used to we were the contract for dope

2187
01:43:03,238 --> 01:43:10,039
magazine when we judged all of their uh

2188
01:43:06,198 --> 01:43:13,960
cannabis competitions and I mean my team

2189
01:43:10,039 --> 01:43:16,679
of seven sifting through hundreds of

2190
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:19,639
types of cannabis microscopically at

2191
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:22,399
competitions for years on end in

2192
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:26,118
multiple different states uh we found

2193
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:29,118
one of these uh while we were judging

2194
01:43:26,118 --> 01:43:32,279
and it was cool to have a a team of us

2195
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:34,639
guys who know this stuff real well all

2196
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:37,118
be able to look through a microscope and

2197
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:39,800
turn a flower around and continue to see

2198
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:43,598
this this one rare Tricom that very

2199
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:45,960
rarely sticks its head out um show up

2200
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:48,000
and and we could all definitely see it

2201
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:50,880
with our own eyes a verify that it was

2202
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,439
there take pictures of it um but do you

2203
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,760
think this do you think this is

2204
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:58,359
genetically or environmentally

2205
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:01,079
controlled do you have any idea of why

2206
01:43:58,359 --> 01:44:04,679
it has a different shape is the waxy

2207
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:08,118
cuticle emitted different or you

2208
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:12,279
understand what I'm getting at yeah and

2209
01:44:08,118 --> 01:44:13,839
this that's this that's the you're

2210
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:17,679
that's the area that I need a lot of

2211
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:20,199
help with right because I'm not a um a

2212
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:23,880
scientist at this level well it it would

2213
01:44:20,198 --> 01:44:28,479
be interesting max if you could find a a

2214
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:33,118
particular clone or variety where most

2215
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:36,759
of the tricomes were this bulbous type

2216
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:39,759
or I forget the name you gave it I I but

2217
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:43,599
I'll just call it you know not round not

2218
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:48,920
oval but uh tear shaped upside

2219
01:44:43,599 --> 01:44:52,039
down yeah um I think you know this you

2220
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:54,239
know I to me science is a that would

2221
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:57,039
show it was genetic Al

2222
01:44:54,238 --> 01:45:01,839
controlled I you know science to me is a

2223
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:05,880
community effort and my my role in this

2224
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:09,840
has been to be the one to observe it and

2225
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:12,359
spend five years trying to find it and

2226
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,599
getting my hands on the genetic that

2227
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:18,198
consistently produces this

2228
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:21,599
triome um and and and then growing it

2229
01:45:18,198 --> 01:45:23,559
out bringing that to a scientist uh a

2230
01:45:21,599 --> 01:45:26,360
team of scientists at a university

2231
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,320
and then letting them officially

2232
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:31,000
officiate the fact that this is a new

2233
01:45:28,319 --> 01:45:32,920
novel triome and then from there when I

2234
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,399
have a genetic and I've got the Clones

2235
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:37,118
I've got the mothers and I've got a

2236
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:39,879
white paper and this is something novel

2237
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:43,960
and important um I would definitely be

2238
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:45,760
willing to give this plant to someone

2239
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:48,359
who would be able to do the type of

2240
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:52,400
research that you were just mention well

2241
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:53,880
the the head shape is important but it's

2242
01:45:52,399 --> 01:45:56,598
the St

2243
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:00,279
that is really really unique to be

2244
01:45:56,599 --> 01:46:01,960
honest yeah well and and the canono

2245
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:04,800
content I mean let's face it if these

2246
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:08,239
things are being grown for for cannaboid

2247
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:11,440
Content what is the impact on on on

2248
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:14,399
cannaboid profile and yield from these I

2249
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:17,198
mean when I see the more bulbous Tricom

2250
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:19,598
I always think conventionally like you

2251
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:23,000
know and from Reading malbergs work

2252
01:46:19,599 --> 01:46:25,440
where they actually micr catheterized

2253
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,439
these things to actually suck the juice

2254
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:31,960
out of these tricomes I mean that the

2255
01:46:28,439 --> 01:46:34,118
more bulb is the triome the more oil

2256
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:37,920
that's there the higher the yield would

2257
01:46:34,118 --> 01:46:39,198
be the more mature the Cannabis profile

2258
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,880
would be and the

2259
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:45,000
oil does it have a different number of

2260
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:47,760
cells inside the resin head that are

2261
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,439
emitting the cannaboids and Turpin that

2262
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:53,480
would be I'm quite curious right like

2263
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:57,598
the tpine kind so are we refer ing to

2264
01:46:53,479 --> 01:47:00,198
the to the like the lower left hand side

2265
01:46:57,599 --> 01:47:03,760
uh the one where it just looks like it

2266
01:47:00,198 --> 01:47:07,118
has a head that shriv shriveled up

2267
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:09,560
no upper right hand side yeah the upper

2268
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:12,519
right hand the top side unfortunately

2269
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:15,159
the in this Photograph the Tricom that's

2270
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:18,080
centered is the the middle Tricom which

2271
01:47:15,158 --> 01:47:21,198
is a beautiful image of a what I would

2272
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:23,679
consider a a perfect capitate stock

2273
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:26,479
Tricom if if we were judging tricomes

2274
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:29,279
forther right uh but if you go to the

2275
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:32,759
the farthest triome on the very right

2276
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:35,118
the stock of the tear drop I see now my

2277
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,239
my zoom speaker panel was covering that

2278
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:40,880
Max I could see it now well welcome to

2279
01:47:37,238 --> 01:47:42,759
the party mark check no I can see it so

2280
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:47,079
it come it comes to a point at the very

2281
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:49,880
end okay I see I see and the stem is uh

2282
01:47:47,079 --> 01:47:53,599
uh a quarter the thickness of the big

2283
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:55,400
fat stems of the other tricomes yeah so

2284
01:47:53,599 --> 01:47:58,880
would wouldn't you worry that that would

2285
01:47:55,399 --> 01:48:02,359
make these tricomes brittle

2286
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:05,000
and okay so that'd be a real drag if

2287
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:08,079
you're try to make cash and the Tricom

2288
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,279
stems were brittle and the resin fell

2289
01:48:08,079 --> 01:48:13,599
off really easy when you wanted it to

2290
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:15,800
real bummer well you know what I was

2291
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:18,800
hearing and I've heard this now twice in

2292
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:23,079
like as many weeks Sam is that these

2293
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:24,760
high CBG varieties especially the white

2294
01:48:23,079 --> 01:48:28,198
there's a variety called the white

2295
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:30,639
that's a very high Variety in CBG it's

2296
01:48:28,198 --> 01:48:33,198
it's um grown here in North America and

2297
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:38,000
it's like anywhere between 13 to

2298
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:39,479
18% CBG hardly any THC at all and they

2299
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,319
said that's what they said the issue

2300
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:44,198
with that is that you know harvesting

2301
01:48:41,319 --> 01:48:45,920
and getting the material to the lab is

2302
01:48:44,198 --> 01:48:48,439
is very very crucial because the

2303
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:50,760
tricomes are so brittle you get a lot of

2304
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:52,919
loss in just handling a plant material

2305
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,719
hey Mark this is some CBG right here

2306
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:56,800
that I'm holding up if you can see that

2307
01:48:54,719 --> 01:49:01,560
that's uh some some

2308
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:06,400
sift made um yeah perent what percentage

2309
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:11,119
CBT analyze for so it's uh on the the

2310
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:13,759
flower was uh I think a 12 to 15%

2311
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:17,198
depending on the batch and then the hash

2312
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:18,840
came in around um or the the sift I

2313
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:21,198
should say come came around in you know

2314
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:23,560
anywhere from 60 to

2315
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:28,678
70 really

2316
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:32,159
70% CBG yep I'm surprised it was green

2317
01:49:28,679 --> 01:49:34,000
CB didn't it there he is I was waiting

2318
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:37,598
Mark

2319
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:41,238
cbga so yeah Sam this is uh this is your

2320
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:42,920
sh um it's quite nice actually I like

2321
01:49:41,238 --> 01:49:45,039
the effects from CBG it's really

2322
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:47,719
interesting very

2323
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:50,238
uplifting and the tur profile and those

2324
01:49:47,719 --> 01:49:52,920
isolates are pretty I mean it's it's

2325
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:54,479
nice it's like a good product right it's

2326
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,079
okay I mean it just depends on what

2327
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:59,238
you're looking for if you're looking for

2328
01:49:56,079 --> 01:50:00,960
a more hempy uh profile then it's right

2329
01:49:59,238 --> 01:50:03,238
up your alley if you're looking for a

2330
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:07,158
drug cultivar really

2331
01:50:03,238 --> 01:50:10,158
turpy you know it's not really that um

2332
01:50:07,158 --> 01:50:10,158
but

2333
01:50:25,158 --> 01:50:30,000
I don't know the the background on the

2334
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:32,239
white to be honest um I came in from

2335
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,238
Switzerland those guys brought those

2336
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:35,118
those genetics in from Switzerland I saw

2337
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:38,158
it

2338
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:40,519
happen like two years over a period of

2339
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:44,078
like two years Sam they had this this

2340
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:46,040
variety over in Europe last year then

2341
01:50:44,078 --> 01:50:47,719
the next thing I know those guys those

2342
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:51,479
guys all formed

2343
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:54,158
llc's in Oregon and the next year I

2344
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:56,959
guess my question is where did the Swiss

2345
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:59,078
get it from from the Italians and the

2346
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,198
Italians I know where they got it from

2347
01:50:59,078 --> 01:51:02,599
from the

2348
01:51:00,198 --> 01:51:04,279
ukrainians you know what I I want to add

2349
01:51:02,599 --> 01:51:06,800
something in real quick the picture he

2350
01:51:04,279 --> 01:51:08,960
has up there now I have seen I have

2351
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:11,760
pictures of these for sure Max that I

2352
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:14,239
can uh go through and send you I always

2353
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:16,599
thought it was a cyith hair that a tri

2354
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:19,359
because I'd seen tricomes break off and

2355
01:51:16,599 --> 01:51:21,679
land on other components that weren't

2356
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:25,679
necessarily growing there they hello bye

2357
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:29,639
Marcus what's that so have I seen what

2358
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:32,199
you've seen But heads can fly around and

2359
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:34,480
be stuck on things that didn't produce

2360
01:51:32,198 --> 01:51:36,238
them yeah I always thought of this as

2361
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:38,559
like but then again it is such a light

2362
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:40,078
like it's too hot long of a of a hair

2363
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:42,199
it's too straight it's just too

2364
01:51:40,078 --> 01:51:43,078
different but I I have photos like this

2365
01:51:42,198 --> 01:51:49,279
for

2366
01:51:43,078 --> 01:51:49,279
sure from like 2008 to 2012

2367
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:59,439
another head or it's sticking to a stock

2368
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:00,440
so therefore the head is sticking on the

2369
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:03,598
side of the

2370
01:52:00,439 --> 01:52:05,158
stock like totally I'm 100 like you know

2371
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:08,159
you're talking to someone who's who

2372
01:52:05,158 --> 01:52:10,439
Geeks out on triom I started the ma

2373
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:14,319
that's why peer rbie science is

2374
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:17,000
beautiful when when you when you allow

2375
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:21,078
others to examine it and try to poke hes

2376
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:23,439
in it then if it stands you've got it

2377
01:52:21,078 --> 01:52:26,078
exactly and I want people people to to

2378
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:28,839
to look into this I want University

2379
01:52:26,078 --> 01:52:31,599
scientists to say I want them to be the

2380
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:36,199
ones to say this is scientifically real

2381
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:38,599
and novel because um I'm the

2382
01:52:36,198 --> 01:52:43,198
passionate uh you know cannabis

2383
01:52:38,599 --> 01:52:45,400
Enthusiast interpreter expert um I'm I'm

2384
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:48,198
just the one who says I think this is

2385
01:52:45,399 --> 01:52:49,598
novel and I'll bring this to you and so

2386
01:52:48,198 --> 01:52:53,678
that that's what I've but it's also

2387
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:56,000
taken me five years to find the variety

2388
01:52:53,679 --> 01:53:00,719
and confirm that it is what it is and

2389
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,880
then get seed from it um and uh it's

2390
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:08,520
it's it's been you could write a novel

2391
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:12,639
on uh how crazy this has been um these

2392
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:12,639
tricomes here you know

2393
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:18,759
there's it's it's also really

2394
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:21,199
interesting how mushroom like tricomes

2395
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:25,639
appear um and and what's really

2396
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:29,879
interesting is um the fruiting body of

2397
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:31,400
LSD is also extremely phallic in

2398
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:35,319
mushroom like I don't know if you guys

2399
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:39,519
have ever seen um the Fring body of irot

2400
01:53:35,319 --> 01:53:42,559
fungus uh that produces asilis clus yeah

2401
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:45,040
I have it that tattooed to my kneecap um

2402
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:47,159
but it looks just so mushroomy and so

2403
01:53:45,039 --> 01:53:51,158
yeah you see this cluster of mushroom

2404
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:53,799
looking tricomes here um and it appears

2405
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:55,638
like that almost maybe that brittle

2406
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:58,279
Factor where you said the Tricom heads

2407
01:53:55,639 --> 01:54:00,639
might have fallen off those two tricomes

2408
01:53:58,279 --> 01:54:03,800
right here it's either this has a very

2409
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:06,560
tiny head with a point coming out of it

2410
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:10,000
um and the one behind it looks like its

2411
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:13,159
head fell off um but these are the

2412
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,560
tricomes that have a stem that is a

2413
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:17,719
third the width of a typical capitate

2414
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,199
stocked

2415
01:54:17,719 --> 01:54:22,480
triome uh with you can see the capitate

2416
01:54:20,198 --> 01:54:26,158
stocked triome uh down to the lower

2417
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:29,559
right right there and um yeah this is

2418
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:32,719
that bizarre uh bulbous shaped head

2419
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:35,840
which is not your classic capitate stock

2420
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:40,880
shaped head and then the rest of the

2421
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:47,000
Tricom continuing off from that head

2422
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:49,359
that is not a mutation I don't think and

2423
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,399
I also don't think that's you know a

2424
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:55,039
triome that broke off and fell somewhere

2425
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:57,439
else I really do believe that between uh

2426
01:54:55,039 --> 01:55:00,519
this image and the other images that you

2427
01:54:57,439 --> 01:55:03,638
have we're seeing varieties of of this

2428
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:06,320
type of Tricom um ex well that's that

2429
01:55:03,639 --> 01:55:08,599
that was my first question Max um you

2430
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:13,960
know I'm not an expert on plant tricomes

2431
01:55:08,599 --> 01:55:13,960
I do know a couple though um but

2432
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:36,840
factor or some other anomaly that's

2433
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:38,279
producing that well um the what I

2434
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:41,840
there's one

2435
01:55:38,279 --> 01:55:46,639
variety that when I found it had this

2436
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:50,480
triome on it we said okay it's this

2437
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:54,159
variety and I secured some of that

2438
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:57,158
variety that was grown in in um the East

2439
01:55:54,158 --> 01:56:00,118
Coast I secured some that was grown in

2440
01:55:57,158 --> 01:56:03,279
the midwest I secured some that was

2441
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:05,960
grown up north and I'm growing it right

2442
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:05,960
now in

2443
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:12,599
Colorado and so different environments

2444
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:15,880
in different

2445
01:56:12,599 --> 01:56:19,159
geographies are seemingly to produce the

2446
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:20,400
same Tricom based off of the genetic

2447
01:56:19,158 --> 01:56:23,039
that it

2448
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:25,238
is and so I don't think it's an

2449
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:27,840
environmental stress factor that's

2450
01:56:25,238 --> 01:56:31,839
causing these tricomes to abruptly

2451
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:34,960
change their shape I think this is a

2452
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:39,599
type of cannabis plant that is growing a

2453
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:41,880
new type of triome that is a needle in a

2454
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:41,880
hay

2455
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:49,039
stack I think that's what it

2456
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:51,039
is and that's why I've been dedicated to

2457
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:52,399
securing the genetic growing it out

2458
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:55,399
making a relationship with with

2459
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:58,519
University scientists to confirm that

2460
01:56:55,399 --> 01:57:00,920
right so I'm not but just to be clear

2461
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:04,159
the Cannabis that you're finding these

2462
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:06,599
uh different tricomes it's not

2463
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:09,799
exclusively those that you're finding

2464
01:57:06,599 --> 01:57:11,800
those intermingled with regular looking

2465
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:14,639
tricomes and tricomes that we've always

2466
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:18,560
seen yes so so these are just sort of

2467
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:20,960
like a a minor you know type of triome

2468
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:24,360
that you're finding the more you're

2469
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:26,599
looking at these uh uh closeup images of

2470
01:57:24,359 --> 01:57:29,839
tricomes do we know if they've been

2471
01:57:26,599 --> 01:57:32,719
there all along Sam and maybe you know

2472
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:35,520
Max's Discovery here is just any

2473
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:38,599
anything is possible but what I'd like

2474
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:41,880
to say is that if you can find a variety

2475
01:57:38,599 --> 01:57:44,880
where the majority of the tricomes are

2476
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:48,159
of this phenotype or genotype whatever

2477
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:51,639
they are then uh it's probably

2478
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:53,920
genetically controlled if you can find

2479
01:57:51,639 --> 01:57:56,400
one out of a thousand or one out of a

2480
01:57:53,920 --> 01:58:01,480
million and you can only find it on some

2481
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:04,000
plants and not other plants then uh yeah

2482
01:58:01,479 --> 01:58:06,799
uh maybe the environment should be

2483
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:10,760
looked at more I I really don't know if

2484
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:14,239
it's if it could be environmental or or

2485
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:16,719
but uh if if it's real we want to know

2486
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:19,000
and we want to track down and if it's

2487
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:21,480
genetically controlled you can create a

2488
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,279
variety that all of the resin heads are

2489
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:27,000
like that or 99% of them that's what I

2490
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:28,759
was going to say have you can have you

2491
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,439
tried to breed with any of it and and

2492
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:32,400
make those observation I mean I know

2493
01:58:30,439 --> 01:58:35,279
it's it's early and it would take a ton

2494
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:39,039
of what you need to do is self it to

2495
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:41,399
find individuals that have more uh a

2496
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:41,399
higher

2497
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:47,399
incident here's some jar rot tricomes

2498
01:58:45,399 --> 01:58:50,279
for

2499
01:58:47,399 --> 01:58:52,559
you I think this was the white I was I

2500
01:58:50,279 --> 01:58:55,158
was looking for when you uh one of yeah

2501
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:58,599
this is the white I'm pretty sure um

2502
01:58:55,158 --> 01:59:02,000
because the white produces just the the

2503
01:58:58,599 --> 01:59:05,599
most bizarre tricomes that there are

2504
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:08,840
they are capitate stocked tricomes are

2505
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:11,520
are these the high CBG varieties Max yes

2506
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:13,480
yes yes they are and you know they call

2507
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:18,000
the plant the white here it is this is

2508
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:18,000
the white they call it the white

2509
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:34,118
it's a different kind of white

2510
01:59:28,679 --> 01:59:36,239
than uh ripe tricomes when they emanate

2511
01:59:34,118 --> 01:59:38,799
um fullness when their when their

2512
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:42,078
glandular heads are full of chemistry

2513
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:45,159
and they're at a ripening Point prior to

2514
01:59:42,078 --> 01:59:48,078
degradation it's different because that

2515
01:59:45,158 --> 01:59:51,158
type of white is almost this creamy

2516
01:59:48,078 --> 01:59:55,719
white this mother of pearl white um and

2517
01:59:51,158 --> 01:59:58,799
what this High CBG variety produces is

2518
01:59:55,719 --> 02:00:02,158
tricomes that are

2519
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:03,639
glowing bright white okay so let's just

2520
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:05,319
say that there's like you know in the

2521
02:00:03,639 --> 02:00:08,118
paint store there's a difference between

2522
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:11,118
like eggshell white and bright white

2523
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:13,039
that is almost like offensive it's

2524
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:16,279
blinding you know there's there's a

2525
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:19,880
difference in brightness this this High

2526
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:22,800
CBG grows these tricomes that are

2527
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:26,359
glowing bright white in all of the

2528
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:29,279
glandular heads are white and the stocks

2529
02:00:26,359 --> 02:00:32,719
of the heads are white too and that's

2530
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:34,000
what makes this variety striking it

2531
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:38,239
really it's

2532
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:40,599
striking um and so how does that work

2533
02:00:38,238 --> 02:00:42,919
why is that happening how come the the

2534
02:00:40,599 --> 02:00:44,159
why is the white producing tricomes that

2535
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:48,760
are

2536
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:51,598
just this this unique well you stopped

2537
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:54,760
the cannaboid biosynthetic pathway at at

2538
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:58,679
not its end point at at its penultimate

2539
02:00:54,760 --> 02:01:03,159
end point right but um I I I I don't

2540
02:00:58,679 --> 02:01:03,158
know if the physiological

2541
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:19,439
Char and not making thca or CB cbda or

2542
02:01:16,679 --> 02:01:23,480
or or the other

2543
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:26,439
miners have you seen the chemal

2544
02:01:23,479 --> 02:01:29,359
if you rub these white resin well from a

2545
02:01:26,439 --> 02:01:32,678
fresh plant like that looks like that

2546
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:35,479
and uh is it just as sticky as a a

2547
02:01:32,679 --> 02:01:40,520
normal THC High

2548
02:01:35,479 --> 02:01:44,238
plant I from a from an aroma perspective

2549
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:49,199
no no rub your fingers on the resin is

2550
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:52,118
it as sticky and oily as a THC bar

2551
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:55,158
so unfortunately I have not had the

2552
02:01:52,118 --> 02:01:58,000
pleasure to uh grow this plant out

2553
02:01:55,158 --> 02:01:59,078
myself yeah I I can answer the question

2554
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,520
yes

2555
02:01:59,078 --> 02:02:05,840
Sam oh okay well I'm just trying to get

2556
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:09,719
to a reason that makes logical sense why

2557
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:14,279
it's white I I I took one of I took a

2558
02:02:09,719 --> 02:02:16,880
couple tops off of a uh a plants that a

2559
02:02:14,279 --> 02:02:19,559
farmer Amish farmer had down in Maryland

2560
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:23,719
down the road took it back to my lab did

2561
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:27,079
an alcohol extraction and got like a

2562
02:02:23,719 --> 02:02:27,078
90 pure

2563
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:45,479
CBG he had about one or two% THC so

2564
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:48,000
there's a lot of timing uh that needs to

2565
02:02:45,479 --> 02:02:48,799
go into harvesting if you're harvesting

2566
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,039
for

2567
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:56,480
CBG and Mark maybe you can talk about

2568
02:02:52,039 --> 02:02:56,479
this as well but this variety the the

2569
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:14,159
PE you can go to the grocery store and

2570
02:03:11,238 --> 02:03:16,359
buy a watermelon that is just natural

2571
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:19,679
and it comes packed full of seed and

2572
02:03:16,359 --> 02:03:22,118
then you can buy a genetically modified

2573
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:24,960
watermelon that is just seedless or

2574
02:03:22,118 --> 02:03:25,799
grapes that are seedless or apples that

2575
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,439
are

2576
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:33,000
seedless this variety I think if you go

2577
02:03:28,439 --> 02:03:36,839
online and possibly by Oregon seed um

2578
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,279
they um you can buy this plant and grow

2579
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:44,000
a field of it but if you wanted to grow

2580
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:46,920
a field of it again um I guess if you

2581
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:51,198
I'm sure you can clone it but um I just

2582
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:51,199
found it really interesting that

2583
02:03:54,760 --> 02:04:01,320
stuff in a variety of different ways and

2584
02:03:58,039 --> 02:04:03,840
every time I've come in contact with it

2585
02:04:01,319 --> 02:04:07,399
uh just to answer Sam's question uh from

2586
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:10,760
my perspective is the plant was

2587
02:04:07,399 --> 02:04:13,279
extraordinarily dehydrated it had no

2588
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:18,079
Aroma profile whatsoever it had no

2589
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:21,719
stickiness whatsoever it was a very dry

2590
02:04:18,078 --> 02:04:23,880
texture and smell Aroma experience

2591
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:25,480
experience and it almost was

2592
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:27,559
disappointing like it didn't have a lot

2593
02:04:25,479 --> 02:04:30,959
to offer other than the fact that it

2594
02:04:27,559 --> 02:04:34,599
looked nutty with its crazy white

2595
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:38,118
tricomes and it's pretty crazy to find a

2596
02:04:34,599 --> 02:04:39,920
plant with this much biomass with that

2597
02:04:38,118 --> 02:04:42,359
amount of

2598
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:45,319
cannabigerol that late in the flowering

2599
02:04:42,359 --> 02:04:48,158
cycle uh because I'm I'm pretty sure we

2600
02:04:45,319 --> 02:04:50,319
all know that CBG is the mother canabo

2601
02:04:48,158 --> 02:04:52,759
that starts building the others and that

2602
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:55,519
that process happens really early on in

2603
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:57,960
flour and that's why you don't typically

2604
02:04:55,520 --> 02:05:00,239
find a lot of CBG when you harvest your

2605
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:02,279
plant at the end of the cycle the fact

2606
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:04,399
that this plant is being harvested at

2607
02:05:02,279 --> 02:05:07,800
the end of its cycle and it the damn

2608
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:12,198
thing is packed full of CVG it's crazy

2609
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:16,639
but uh from us like marijuana lovers um

2610
02:05:12,198 --> 02:05:20,319
it's not a ooey gooey sticky funky

2611
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:23,039
skunky herb it's just not uh at least

2612
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:25,319
what I came in cont with and then I was

2613
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:27,439
sifting through pounds of this stuff

2614
02:05:25,319 --> 02:05:30,479
looking for a seed

2615
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:33,598
desperately and you just not even the

2616
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:36,319
remnants of a seed not even a a a a

2617
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:39,239
hollow Brack casing that would hold a

2618
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:40,399
seed no seed whatsoever this is a

2619
02:05:39,238 --> 02:05:42,759
seedless

2620
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:44,399
variety from the producers who produce

2621
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:46,679
it of course I'm sure you can find this

2622
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:50,078
variety that does produce seed I'm just

2623
02:05:46,679 --> 02:05:54,480
saying in the marketplace currently in

2624
02:05:50,078 --> 02:05:54,479
the largest amount this is a seedless

2625
02:05:54,679 --> 02:06:01,440
variety hey hey Max um could you show us

2626
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:01,440

2627

photo yeah you know who I uh who I got

2628
02:06:04,679 --> 02:06:12,359
these from

02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:13,920
Jesse no no certified dank yeah yeah I

think I'm gonna use one of these in my

2631
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:19,000
new book if I can squeeze it in I think

2632
02:06:17,238 --> 02:06:20,279
this is the one and I just posted this

2633
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,920
on the triome

2634
02:06:20,279 --> 02:06:29,639
Institute uh Instagram page but I'm I'm

2635
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:34,559
just always in awe when you see style

2636
02:06:29,639 --> 02:06:37,559
stigma that is just that striking it's

2637
02:06:34,559 --> 02:06:39,480
just when you talk about weed porn that

2638
02:06:37,559 --> 02:06:42,159
is just

2639
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:44,919
unreal yeah it's beautiful we're we're

2640

actually growing the pinkleberry by

2641
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:50,840
coffee Kai's coffee uh this year it's a

2642

southern humble and see how it looks and

2645

does right

2646
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:08,279
on I I've seen Afghan plants that would

2647
02:07:04,158 --> 02:07:12,479
produce th those colors of hairs for gwz

2648
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:14,679
the first ones I saw was in the

2649
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:17,479
70s yeah I'll never forget the first

2650
02:07:14,679 --> 02:07:20,239
time I photographed pink hairs under the

2651
02:07:17,479 --> 02:07:23,359
macro and it just I mean even just one

2652
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:26,439
or two of them were so so striking and

2653
02:07:23,359 --> 02:07:30,359
so incredible that uh I remember

2654
02:07:26,439 --> 02:07:30,359
giggling you know as I shot that

2655
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:40,440
plant yeah Coyote Blue um does that as

2656
02:07:35,559 --> 02:07:43,039
well and every once in a while you can

2657
02:07:40,439 --> 02:07:45,078
uh dry it cure it and revisit it and you

2658
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:48,078
can still see some of that color that

2659
02:07:45,078 --> 02:07:51,198
doesn't always happen it's it's a very

2660
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:53,960
special special thing when you when you

2661
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:56,719
go revisit it and you you see the color

2662
02:07:53,960 --> 02:08:00,960
variations it's beautiful hey Craig does

2663
02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:05,399
that coffee that you're working with

2664
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:08,399
um does it have a a distinct and

2665
02:08:05,399 --> 02:08:12,319
noticeable coffee Aroma to it or is it

2666
02:08:08,399 --> 02:08:12,319
just called coffee

2667
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:31,480
Danny I was actually just texting with

uh Ka himself just now um yeah so it's

2669
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:37,718

2670
02:08:33,399 --> 02:08:37,719
made and it and and it definitely has

2671
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:43,559
a I I've only had it a couple times so

2672
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:46,078
I'm going off memory but it's almost

2673
02:08:43,559 --> 02:08:48,440
reminiscent of of Gorilla Glue but but

2674
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:50,000
different you know where Gorilla Glue to

2675
02:08:48,439 --> 02:08:52,238
me is more

2676
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,800
chocolate I I was was at Justin

2677
02:08:52,238 --> 02:08:59,479
calvino's place in

2678
02:08:54,800 --> 02:09:03,840
mesino and um he was showing me this

2679
02:08:59,479 --> 02:09:07,158
coffee and I was just doing backflips I

2680
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:10,440
was over the moon excited because coffee

2681
02:09:07,158 --> 02:09:12,960
is my second favorite drug and I love

2682
02:09:10,439 --> 02:09:14,919
coffee and cannabis together I have mugs

2683
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:17,760
that have coffee and cannabis together I

2684
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:21,480
mean they just it's just I just love it

2685
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:23,599
but the and and cannabis is just

2686
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:27,198
I mean what other thing in the world

2687
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:32,760
smells like blueberry or catpiss smells

2688
02:09:27,198 --> 02:09:36,158
like skunk or like lemonade punch smells

2689
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:38,679
like tangerines or dog [ __ ] smells

2690
02:09:36,158 --> 02:09:43,799
exactly like coffee I mean this

2691
02:09:38,679 --> 02:09:50,719
plant can mimic The Identical Aroma

2692
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:56,159
profiles of beverages food and uh feal

2693
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:58,198
matter uh like like a pro and you you

2694
02:09:56,158 --> 02:10:00,118
you just think that like coffee would be

2695
02:09:58,198 --> 02:10:02,158
like oh this guy is stoned and just

2696
02:10:00,118 --> 02:10:05,359
imagines this this smells like coffee

2697
02:10:02,158 --> 02:10:07,479
it's like no smell it this smells like

2698
02:10:05,359 --> 02:10:10,639
coffee this cannabis plant smells like

2699
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:12,319
coffee and I got so excited and calvina

2700
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:14,239
was like yeah I just rescued this one

2701
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:15,799
little clone and it like looked like sad

2702
02:10:14,238 --> 02:10:17,839
and sickly on the side and he's like

2703
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:19,840
there's no more of this anywhere left

2704
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:22,360
he's like this is the last the coffee

2705
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,800
and I was terrified that we were GNA

2706
02:10:22,359 --> 02:10:29,639
lose this like amazing plant and I've

2707
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:31,960
always wanted to do a pairing um at a uh

2708
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:35,719
with a coffee cuppers I don't know if

2709
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:39,000
you guys know that like a wine somaler

2710
02:10:35,719 --> 02:10:41,599
somaler cannabis interponer and

2711
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:46,840
turpening um you know you're a beer

2712
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:46,840
cicerone you're a cheese Monger uh

2713
02:10:48,399 --> 02:10:53,238
you're um and if you guys haven't seen

2714
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:58,880
the experts of which is actually shown

2715
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:02,559
in California where these crazy

2716
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:05,239
Californians are growing coffee um as a

2717
02:11:02,559 --> 02:11:07,840
Vine horizontally instead of letting the

2718
02:11:05,238 --> 02:11:11,118
tree grow up vertically I think you can

2719
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:13,679
find that on uh Vice I think it's called

2720
02:11:11,118 --> 02:11:15,439
something like coffee land to Mecca

2721
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,440
Coffee Land Mecca but if you look that

2722
02:11:15,439 --> 02:11:21,799
up you will see these people that are

2723
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:23,479
just so enthralled with um uh with c but

2724
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:25,679
I I'm sorry for that rant I just got

2725
02:11:23,479 --> 02:11:28,919

do a do something with that a coffee

2728
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:33,760
parent with

2729
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:41,719
coffee they also do it with tea with

2730
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:43,960
cigars I mean cheese it's just on and on

2731

and

2732
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:51,319
on and only in Japan are you considered

2733
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:51,319
a tea master

2734
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:56,400
well I think China produces more tea and

2735
02:11:54,599 --> 02:11:59,199
uh some really fancy

2736
02:11:56,399 --> 02:12:02,920
ones from a product perspective I'm sure

2737
02:11:59,198 --> 02:12:05,039
China does but from a h Hospitality

2738
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:08,599
perspective I don't think anybody serves

2739
02:12:05,039 --> 02:12:12,359
tea the way that a Japanese formal tea

2740
02:12:08,599 --> 02:12:15,239
party is is done it's it's it's a pretty

2741
02:12:12,359 --> 02:12:19,000
elaborate ceremony if you

2742
02:12:15,238 --> 02:12:22,959
will indeed it is I've

2743
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:26,118
gotta I've got to uh say good day to

2744
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:28,198
everybody um temperature's getting hot

2745
02:12:26,118 --> 02:12:30,000
and we've got lots and lots of Nursery

2746
02:12:28,198 --> 02:12:33,638
stock out there that need to be up

2747
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,158
potted and implanted and cared for so I

2748
02:12:33,639 --> 02:12:38,599
want to thank everyone

2749
02:12:36,158 --> 02:12:41,000
um today for this time and space I

2750
02:12:38,599 --> 02:12:41,000
appreciate

2751
02:12:41,078 --> 02:12:45,960
y'all good to see you buddy thanks for

2752
02:12:43,479 --> 02:12:45,959
coming in

2753
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:53,039
Craig good luck on the F Craig never at

2754
02:12:51,319 --> 02:12:55,439
the farmers for more than a couple hours

2755
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:57,679
if you're take care Joshua got to work

2756
02:12:55,439 --> 02:12:57,678
on

2757
02:12:58,238 --> 02:13:03,638
Plants say I I have some

2758
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:05,519
micology uh projects today I need to get

2759
02:13:03,639 --> 02:13:11,279
to and

2760
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:16,719
um a couple hundred cacti I need to move

2761
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:19,279
um max are you showing the the uh hops

2762
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:21,439
cannabis or are you saving that till

2763
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:23,198
next week yeah thanks for getting on

2764
02:13:21,439 --> 02:13:25,319
what a what a than you're getting on

2765
02:13:23,198 --> 02:13:28,359
that I want to hear about that man I'm I

2766
02:13:25,319 --> 02:13:29,719
my top three are hops or are beer coffee

2767
02:13:28,359 --> 02:13:31,920
and cannabis so when you're talking

2768
02:13:29,719 --> 02:13:35,198
about coffee I light up and then I I

2769
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,199
totally spaced on that but

2770
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:46,559
I

2771
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:49,760
okay you

2772
02:13:46,559 --> 02:13:51,719
guys you pull all my uh all these

2773
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:54,239
secrets out of me cuz trying to like you

2774
02:13:51,719 --> 02:13:56,118
know do the science on these tricomes

2775
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:59,519
before other people do I'm trying I

2776
02:13:56,118 --> 02:14:02,558
would never you know go on something as

2777
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:05,880
big as hash church with as many you've

2778
02:14:02,559 --> 02:14:08,520
got some of the world's experts in Korea

2779
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:09,840
let me tell you yeah well and you know

2780
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,239
what and that's why I appreciate when

2781
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:16,440
you guys uh confirm that what I think

2782
02:14:12,238 --> 02:14:22,078
I've discovered um might actually

2783
02:14:16,439 --> 02:14:22,078
be uh something worth worth sharing

2784
02:14:22,439 --> 02:14:26,558
uh these are all canvas and hops

2785
02:14:34,359 --> 02:14:41,279
hybrids and so this this is a vine that

2786
02:14:38,118 --> 02:14:44,118
is producing hop

2787
02:14:41,279 --> 02:14:46,639
cones and the hot right and the Hop cone

2788
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:48,639
will grow downward kind of like a little

2789
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:51,159
uh right it's a little hop it's a hop

2790
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:54,199
cone these hop cones are covered

2791
02:14:51,158 --> 02:14:57,118
glandular tricomes that are producing

2792
02:14:54,198 --> 02:15:00,719
177% THC 8%

2793
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:03,479
CBD and so you can grow a wall of these

2794
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:06,800
hops up the side of your house uh in

2795
02:15:03,479 --> 02:15:10,359
Vine like ways and and pull the mature

2796
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:13,719
cones off of the plants um is that based

2797
02:15:10,359 --> 02:15:17,198
on dried way to plant material those

2798
02:15:13,719 --> 02:15:19,559
percentages yes so can you repeat that

2799
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:22,078
again Max yeah so you're looking right

2800
02:15:19,559 --> 02:15:24,960
now you're actually looking at at

2801
02:15:22,078 --> 02:15:29,198
microscopic Tricom

2802
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:31,520
pictures of this hybrid of humulus and

2803
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:34,000
cannabis and you can these are the

2804
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:35,040
glandular tricomes that are producing

2805
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,679
anywhere

2806
02:15:35,039 --> 02:15:41,800
between

2807
02:15:36,679 --> 02:15:44,359
um uh I think 12 to 17% THC and upwards

2808
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:50,159
of 5 to 8%

2809
02:15:44,359 --> 02:15:53,359
CBD and the the cones are um smokable

2810
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:55,679
this is a great of the plant uh you can

2811
02:15:53,359 --> 02:15:59,479
definitely tell that this is not

2812
02:15:55,679 --> 02:16:02,639
anything like uh duck foot or any of the

2813
02:15:59,479 --> 02:16:05,439
other webbed foot varieties because of

2814
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:09,639
the rest of the shape of the leaf notice

2815
02:16:05,439 --> 02:16:11,238
how there's no uh ridges in the leaf

2816
02:16:09,639 --> 02:16:13,960
right like if this was duck foot you

2817
02:16:11,238 --> 02:16:16,399
would see leaf ridging and look at the

2818
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:20,639
triome matter coming out of this hot

2819
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:21,558
plant um I mean that is really uh uh

2820
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:23,639
quite

2821
02:16:21,559 --> 02:16:27,279
uh quite cannabis

2822
02:16:23,639 --> 02:16:29,400
indicative um this is uh the plant this

2823
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:31,920
is a cannabis hot plant and this one is

2824
02:16:29,399 --> 02:16:35,478
growing this one took on more of the

2825
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:38,280
form of the cannabis plant and less hop

2826
02:16:35,478 --> 02:16:42,679
Vine so this is really like a bushy kind

2827
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:45,840
of cannabis plant um but it is not 100%

2828
02:16:42,679 --> 02:16:48,478
cannabis this one is another great

2829
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:51,679
example but this one does have the leaf

2830
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:55,599
uh ridging and the reason why

2831
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:59,159
is because um uh this is not the same

2832
02:16:55,599 --> 02:17:01,478
genetic as the last one um what what I

2833
02:16:59,159 --> 02:17:03,119
can tell you about this genetic is this

2834
02:17:01,478 --> 02:17:06,558
was actually

2835
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:09,319
ruderalis that was cross spread with um

2836
02:17:06,558 --> 02:17:12,920
the type of hot plant that receives uh

2837
02:17:09,318 --> 02:17:19,478
the cannabis genetics as a cross Max is

2838
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:25,079
he producing corn corns like from what a

2839
02:17:19,478 --> 02:17:29,119
a hop root is or is it producing

2840
02:17:25,079 --> 02:17:32,599
seeds it is producing seeds uh the hot

2841
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:36,319
plant and cannabis both produce

2842
02:17:32,599 --> 02:17:38,200
seed what's the tpping profile like

2843
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:41,318
hasn't been tested

2844
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:44,120
yet does it also have

2845
02:17:41,318 --> 02:17:46,478
romes reproduce that

2846
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:49,319
way yeah that that's what I was

2847
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:52,000
referring to by cors I don't know the

2848
02:17:49,318 --> 02:17:55,398
proper term I

2849
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:58,558
um I am not growing this plant and the

2850
02:17:55,398 --> 02:18:00,760
gentleman who created the the the first

2851
02:17:58,558 --> 02:18:05,039
variety that actually took and turned

2852
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:09,359
into an F7 uh humulus cannabis is in

2853
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:11,439
Europe um this is a a friend of mine who

2854
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:15,280
got a hold of the genetic in the United

2855
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:17,639
States and crossed it with um some

2856
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:21,040
marijuana types that he he was

2857
02:18:17,638 --> 02:18:23,318
hybridizing um indoors in his basement

2858
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:27,639
and so this is a cannabis

2859
02:18:23,318 --> 02:18:30,359
leaf that took on the shape of that hop

2860
02:18:27,638 --> 02:18:33,478
plant I was showing you that has the uh

2861
02:18:30,359 --> 02:18:35,559
duck foot but without the leaf ridging

2862
02:18:33,478 --> 02:18:39,679
and so here you have a cannabis leaf

2863
02:18:35,558 --> 02:18:43,478
that actually took on the smooth Leaf

2864
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:45,558
Edge instead of the rided edging um and

2865
02:18:43,478 --> 02:18:48,478
that's carried down from that hop line

2866
02:18:45,558 --> 02:18:52,959
and that hop genetic and so these

2867
02:18:48,478 --> 02:18:54,438
genetics are their brand spanking new in

2868
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:56,079
in the world

2869
02:18:54,439 --> 02:19:00,040
of

2870
02:18:56,079 --> 02:19:01,079
species um this is a new species I mean

2871
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:04,679
that's what we're talking about we're

2872
02:19:01,079 --> 02:19:08,439
talking about a new species and and then

2873
02:19:04,679 --> 02:19:08,439
what's interesting is a little of this

2874
02:19:08,599 --> 02:19:14,799
spe genetic profile can go back into

2875
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:18,318
cannabis and put some of its genome back

2876
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:19,718
into more uh um you know cannabis

2877
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:22,760
genetics and I think that's what you're

2878
02:19:19,718 --> 02:19:24,638
seeing here with other cannabis Farmers

2879
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:28,719
breeding into the genetic or breeding

2880
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:31,199
the genetic into cannabis and really

2881
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:35,199
this just produces a thousand more

2882
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:38,559
questions than it does answers right

2883
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:40,840
what is this what's the turpine profile

2884
02:19:38,558 --> 02:19:44,000
what's the tricomes look like I I think

2885
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:46,519
these are passionate farmers and

2886
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,478
breeders doing what they do best which

2887
02:19:46,519 --> 02:19:50,719
is just growing the stuff out and seeing

2888
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:52,599
what they get but these guys aren't

2889
02:19:50,719 --> 02:19:54,920
putting this stuff under

2890
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:58,840
microscopes um nor are they bringing

2891
02:19:54,920 --> 02:20:01,280
this stuff to universities to study um

2892
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:06,159
uh the genome profile with uh in that

2893
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:07,640
way and so I I hope to just assist these

2894
02:20:06,159 --> 02:20:12,639
passionate

2895
02:20:07,639 --> 02:20:14,318
breeders um and uh by by helping them

2896
02:20:12,639 --> 02:20:16,439
bring some of these genetics to

2897
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:19,079
universities and other places to produce

2898
02:20:16,439 --> 02:20:21,318
some white papers on this stuff because

2899
02:20:19,079 --> 02:20:23,639
without question

2900
02:20:21,318 --> 02:20:26,559
this is new stuff this is brand new

2901
02:20:23,639 --> 02:20:29,519
stuff um in cannabis for

2902
02:20:26,559 --> 02:20:31,840
sure it's no longer cannabis it's no

2903
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:33,359
longer cannabis exactly yeah now we're

2904
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:35,719
we're getting into new

2905
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:37,920
territory well very trippy dude thanks

2906
02:20:35,719 --> 02:20:41,599
for sharing that was uh that yeah

2907
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:44,398
totally thank you you're welcome I mean

2908
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:46,239
it's an honor right like this is how

2909
02:20:44,398 --> 02:20:47,639
well be interesting to like dab those

2910
02:20:46,239 --> 02:20:51,318
concentrates like what would it

2911
02:20:47,639 --> 02:20:54,079
concentrate from those right I mean

2912
02:20:51,318 --> 02:20:56,920
I I I go right to that

2913
02:20:54,079 --> 02:20:59,398
right it would be uh yeah of course you

2914
02:20:56,920 --> 02:21:02,359
go right to Citra Kush Citra kush man

2915
02:20:59,398 --> 02:21:05,000
all day well if it's got THC in it and

2916
02:21:02,359 --> 02:21:06,800
CBD in it why why wouldn't they get you

2917
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,840
high I guess that's the question it does

2918
02:21:06,799 --> 02:21:10,398
get you high yeah and so this is like

2919
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:13,760
how cool is it like we're now grow and

2920
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:15,119
like and you know um I uh because I'm

2921
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:16,960
writing about this stuff in the new

2922
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:19,680
interpreting book I I did get the

2923
02:21:16,959 --> 02:21:21,438
breeder of this hop um cannabis hybrid

2924
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:23,479
on the phone and I did

2925
02:21:21,439 --> 02:21:25,600
about this I got the whole backstory all

2926
02:21:23,478 --> 02:21:28,199
the different genetics went down where

2927
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:31,200
it went down how it happened um so I'm

2928
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:34,079
writing about all of that my new book um

2929
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:36,960
are you gonna drop uh his name yeah yeah

2930
02:21:34,079 --> 02:21:39,079
in locations and all those things so you

2931
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:39,079
the

2932
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:49,359
book so uh um but he confirmed that the

2933
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:52,359
purpose of this right like he wasn't

2934
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:54,040
trying to produce a new species of plant

2935
02:21:52,359 --> 02:21:56,640
you know to get on the cover of National

2936
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:59,800
Geographic but I think that could be uh

2937
02:21:56,639 --> 02:22:03,119
that could this could be uh that could

2938
02:21:59,799 --> 02:22:05,478
be one of those things his goal was to

2939
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:08,640
try to do something similar uh to the

2940
02:22:05,478 --> 02:22:11,840
ABC genetic right can can you produce a

2941
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:16,398
cannabis plant um that produces cannabis

2942
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:19,239
in cognito so that Becky next St and the

2943
02:22:16,398 --> 02:22:21,079
sheriff across the street don't notice

2944
02:22:19,239 --> 02:22:23,639
that you've got ganja GR growing in your

2945
02:22:21,079 --> 02:22:26,920
yard right that that's kind of and that

2946
02:22:23,639 --> 02:22:30,599
was his goal right what could I produce

2947
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:32,639
hops that could grow as a hops plant

2948
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:34,960
that just so happened to be cannaboid

2949
02:22:32,639 --> 02:22:37,239
rich in in in a way in which I could

2950
02:22:34,959 --> 02:22:40,079
smoke it so could I just grow a big hop

2951
02:22:37,239 --> 02:22:43,159
vine on the side of my house and just

2952
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:45,959
not have to deal with plant counts or if

2953
02:22:43,159 --> 02:22:49,000
it's medical is it legal do I have a

2954
02:22:45,959 --> 02:22:51,318
license for it it's like [ __ ] it [ __ ]

2955
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:53,280
everything I'm just going to grow Vine

2956
02:22:51,318 --> 02:22:56,879
up the side of my house and if it gets

2957
02:22:53,280 --> 02:23:00,040
me high well then you can come over for

2958
02:22:56,879 --> 02:23:03,398
my backyard barbecue and try SL my

2959
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:06,000
hops Vine so that's I've confirmed that

2960
02:23:03,398 --> 02:23:09,000
that was the do they also function like

2961
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:11,359
hops like can you make beer from them

2962
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:14,760
you know what I I have no idea why you

2963
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:17,439
wouldn't be able to and

2964
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:19,960
um I need to get my hands on this

2965
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:22,880
genetic and work with it because I I

2966
02:23:19,959 --> 02:23:27,398
need to explore a lot of these things um

2967
02:23:22,879 --> 02:23:29,438
but it there it's weird I my

2968
02:23:27,398 --> 02:23:32,119
understanding of it

2969
02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:37,159
is you know the

2970
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:40,640
uh um the plant that produces Jin

2971
02:23:37,159 --> 02:23:43,239
Juniper Jesus you know that Juniper is

2972
02:23:40,639 --> 02:23:45,278
either a tree or a

2973
02:23:43,239 --> 02:23:47,719
bush and like when you're out in the

2974
02:23:45,279 --> 02:23:50,120
mountains of Colorado you see Juniper

2975
02:23:47,719 --> 02:23:51,358
bushes and then you also see juniper

2976
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:54,720
tree

2977
02:23:51,359 --> 02:24:00,439
it's really interesting um I think half

2978
02:23:54,719 --> 02:24:03,719
of these hybrids are more hop like and

2979
02:24:00,439 --> 02:24:05,559
they grow more vines that produce cones

2980
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:07,519
that that have tricomes on them that are

2981
02:24:05,559 --> 02:24:10,318
cannaboid rich and I think the others

2982
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:13,960
produce bushes that are more like

2983
02:24:10,318 --> 02:24:16,119
cannabis plants that grow more Bud um

2984
02:24:13,959 --> 02:24:18,119
and so the the ones that are more like

2985
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:21,200
hot plants that grow more like Vines I

2986
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:23,960
would have to imagine you could Brew

2987
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:26,359
um as as

2988
02:24:23,959 --> 02:24:29,719
canibu which is a name that I federally

2989
02:24:26,359 --> 02:24:32,200
trademarked in 2009 when I thought I was

2990
02:24:29,719 --> 02:24:35,119
GNA produce cannabis beer instead of

2991
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:36,720
starting a cannabis education company

2992
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:40,359
which sometimes I still

2993
02:24:36,719 --> 02:24:40,358
wonder which I should have

2994
02:24:41,318 --> 02:24:47,278
done that's cool man very very cool I

2995
02:24:44,398 --> 02:24:50,439
like it I'm uh I'll be checking out the

2996
02:24:47,279 --> 02:24:52,359
book when it comes out and we'll see uh

2997
02:24:50,439 --> 02:24:53,840
go deeper into this I'm sure Nick zegler

2998
02:24:52,359 --> 02:24:55,159
would have been very interested to hear

2999
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:58,159
this today I'll have to send him the

3000
02:24:55,159 --> 02:25:01,559
link later um I did want to share a

3001
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:03,239
couple of uh your shots best friend

3002
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:04,559
farmer and maybe you could tell us a

3003
02:25:03,239 --> 02:25:06,478
little bit about these shots dude

3004
02:25:04,559 --> 02:25:08,559
because I've really been enjoying these

3005
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:11,438
shots uh you're making these like

3006
02:25:08,559 --> 02:25:13,559
dessert like shots that you're taking on

3007
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:15,720
your Instagram what's what's what's

3008
02:25:13,559 --> 02:25:19,478
going on

3009
02:25:15,719 --> 02:25:24,519
here oh that one I can look at it that's

3010
02:25:19,478 --> 02:25:28,799
a 120 Micron gas mask uh indoor air

3011
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:33,439
dried hash rosin cake on that one with a

3012
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:35,799
beehive stamp dude it's just lovely this

3013
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:38,639
one also I was just like thank

3014
02:25:35,799 --> 02:25:40,759
you yeah I like that one a lot that's

3015
02:25:38,639 --> 02:25:43,199
kind of like I was on this comfort food

3016
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:45,520
kind of tip you know where I was even

3017
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:47,960
going back to the foods that my mom made

3018
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:50,399
growing up with it's kind of eerie

3019
02:25:47,959 --> 02:25:52,679
almost how closely connected in person

3020
02:25:50,398 --> 02:25:54,519
all the hashes to me and those type of

3021
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:57,239
foods which I don't really eat anymore

3022
02:25:54,520 --> 02:26:01,439
but I'm gluten-free for five years so i'

3023
02:25:57,239 --> 02:26:05,478
I'd have to go GF but um that one is

3024
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:05,479
actually apparently Colin likes this

3025
02:26:07,318 --> 02:26:13,199
too it looks like an apple cider

3026
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:14,359
donut yeah Colin actually I think was

3027
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:17,079
the one that said it looked like an

3028
02:26:14,359 --> 02:26:17,760
apple cider donnut with a maple glazing

3029
02:26:17,079 --> 02:26:20,840

3030
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:23,439
it even that one is uh

3031
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:26,079
on the outside what's that rosin all

3032
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:29,920
along the outside it's all just so well

3033
02:26:26,079 --> 02:26:35,600
done yeah very thank you you know

3034

3036
02:26:38,439 --> 02:26:42,359
right there man that was like all of

3037
02:26:40,079 --> 02:26:44,600
these I actually did by hand a couple of

3038
02:26:42,359 --> 02:26:47,640
them on a Sunday even and just kind of

3039
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:51,880
like escape from all the industry stuff

3040
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:54,358
which is so involving and I you know to

3041
02:26:51,879 --> 02:26:56,879
kind of go back to some Artistic Touch

3042
02:26:54,359 --> 02:26:59,960
on it stuff I like to do and I just kind

3043
02:26:56,879 --> 02:27:01,599

02:27:19,959 --> 02:27:27,079
a 90 uh Micron air dried whole plant

3055
02:27:23,279 --> 02:27:29,520
cured flow indoor bubble hash for the

3056
02:27:27,079 --> 02:27:31,719
the actual doughnut and then that's a 90

3057
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:34,000
Micron air dried whole plant fresh

3058
02:27:31,719 --> 02:27:36,840
frozen that's some air dried fresh

3059
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:38,760
frozen I get a lot of the the tannin

3060
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:41,279
richness on my air drrive but it's just

3061
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:44,200
as Saucy it'll never go stable it's just

3062
02:27:41,279 --> 02:27:47,279
sauce and then it's all it's all in line

3063
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:50,200
gas mask all three and then I got a 120

3064
02:27:47,279 --> 02:27:53,319
Micron again air dried hole plant cured

3065
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:55,240
flower crumble on the seeve portion so

3066
02:27:53,318 --> 02:27:58,439
that's just like some chunk that we

3067
02:27:55,239 --> 02:28:00,079
didn't Z didn't press and kind of the

3068
02:27:58,439 --> 02:28:02,680
cool thing is with air dried is we're

3069
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:04,920
seeing some different texture and tan

3070
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:07,439
and richness uh differences that you

3071
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:10,920
don't really get when you have just

3072
02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:13,479
fresh frozen or freeze-dried so kind of

3073
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:15,639
fun we're actually applying some of the

3074
02:28:13,478 --> 02:28:18,119
darker tan and stuff and it's none of

3075
02:28:15,639 --> 02:28:20,559
it's BS though it's all melty I'd I'd

3076
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:23,160

yeah yeah that one is actually gas mask

3124
02:30:40,318 --> 02:30:45,318
in the middle for a rosin I think that's

3125
02:30:42,398 --> 02:30:48,840
a 120 Micron a dried indoor and then

3126
02:30:45,318 --> 02:30:52,239
those were some hacap which was Sunday

3127
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:55,079
is Sunday brunch by great pie on some

3128
02:30:52,239 --> 02:30:58,079
broadspectrum air dried stuff you know

3129
02:30:55,079 --> 02:31:00,719
kind of wider broadspectrum and that's

3130
02:30:58,079 --> 02:31:03,000
the cookie that's the scale and I can

3131
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:05,760
show you guys

3132
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:08,398
again the cookie amazed me how much it

3133
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:10,760
looks like an unbaked cookie it's kind

3134
02:31:08,398 --> 02:31:10,760
of

3135
02:31:13,398 --> 02:31:18,519
crazy there's that that guy what are the

3136
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:21,640
chocolate chips made out

3137
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:24,720
of ch chocolate chips are a broad

3138
02:31:21,639 --> 02:31:27,000
spectrum also kind of like a wider uh

3139
02:31:24,719 --> 02:31:30,199
broad spectrum from trim hash bubble

3140
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:32,439
hash all Air dried and kind of long air

3141
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:34,720
dry on that stuff maybe even up to like

3142
02:31:32,439 --> 02:31:36,920
three weeks so it's got the tannin

3143
02:31:34,719 --> 02:31:38,438
richness to it and then I'll just check

3144
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:39,478
myself real quick to make sure because

3145
02:31:38,439 --> 02:31:43,520
it's been a

3146
02:31:39,478 --> 02:31:45,599
minute um so the chips are two grams

3147
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:48,520
they're quarter gram each and it's gas

3148
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:50,920
mask actually broads Spectrum air dried

3149
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:54,319
from the trim in the littles and then

3150
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:56,920
the cookie was a 26 gram gas Mass 90

3151
02:31:54,318 --> 02:31:58,959
Micron air dried and it was just this

3152
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:01,040
bubble hash that on the gas mask

3153
02:31:58,959 --> 02:32:04,639
cultivar is one of those that speaks to

3154
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:06,040
the real blonde creamy greasy hash and

3155
02:32:04,639 --> 02:32:08,840
I've talked about it before it's just

3156
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:11,120
one of those special hash plants and it

3157
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:13,880
kind of retains its creaminess and and

3158
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:16,479
greasy feel even later on it still has

3159
02:32:13,879 --> 02:32:20,318
the the cookie still has it right now

3160
02:32:16,478 --> 02:32:22,478
so it sounded like

3161
02:32:20,318 --> 02:32:23,799
when you were like describing what these

3162
02:32:22,478 --> 02:32:25,239
different things were I was just

3163
02:32:23,799 --> 02:32:28,039
laughing because it just sounded like

3164
02:32:25,239 --> 02:32:30,799
such just I don't know I love it that

3165
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:32,439
was great it's fun yeah I've had a lot

3166
02:32:30,799 --> 02:32:35,119
of fun true

3167
02:32:32,439 --> 02:32:39,120
artist yeah I really appreciate

3168
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:41,920
it someone many ways someone should do a

3169
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:44,520
book on like hash that looks like

3170
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:46,439
desserts and foods and your pictures

3171
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:48,479
could be highlighted in that because

3172
02:32:46,439 --> 02:32:50,000
when I saw them last week I wanted to

3173
02:32:48,478 --> 02:32:51,799
kind of go over them but then you were

3174
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,920
having internet problems or whatever you

3175
02:32:51,799 --> 02:32:56,278
had to go and I didn't bring it up soon

3176
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:57,439
enough yeah by the time I did bring it

3177
02:32:56,279 --> 02:33:00,359
up here

3178
02:32:57,439 --> 02:33:02,200
no I'm really happy the farming didn't

3179
02:33:00,359 --> 02:33:04,120
take over so much that I could come in

3180
02:33:02,200 --> 02:33:06,520
today and actually get the technology

3181
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:10,520
right to because I'm very analog so this

3182
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:13,120
is cool and um I'd love to share show

3183
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:14,439
more of them for sure that's one from

3184
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:16,279
way back and I was going to bring that

3185
02:33:14,439 --> 02:33:18,279
up to mention that one of the things

3186
02:33:16,279 --> 02:33:20,439
that motivated me besides the Comfort

3187
02:33:18,279 --> 02:33:22,560
Food Connection art thing and love for

3188
02:33:20,439 --> 02:33:25,239
hash was that people just kept dropping

3189
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:27,079
bombs for comments on the Instagram when

3190
02:33:25,239 --> 02:33:29,119
it came to these type of hash things

3191
02:33:27,079 --> 02:33:32,760
from the air drive that we were doing

3192
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:35,240
that we make and it kind of just really

3193
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:38,159
struck me to where why not make these

3194
02:33:35,239 --> 02:33:41,119
food items specifically in design

3195
02:33:38,159 --> 02:33:43,000
towards you know looking like that that

3196
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:44,760
food and hash connection there's

3197
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:47,239
definitely something there just like

3198
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:50,398
with the with the tarpine talk that

3199
02:33:47,239 --> 02:33:50,398
we're doing

3200
02:34:09,799 --> 02:34:14,039
I was eating some chocolate and as I

3201
02:34:12,159 --> 02:34:15,680
grabbed up a piece of I thought was

3202
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:17,800
chocolate was hash I started eating it

3203
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:19,040
and I realized it wow so when you're

3204
02:34:17,799 --> 02:34:21,599
saying that it looked like the chocolate

3205
