00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,478
in the sky. Yeah, exactly. Which we're

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,719
going to ex Exactly. There is not a

23
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,519
cloud in the sky except the ones that we

24
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,560
are going to be exhaling. So, we've got

25
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,000
uh you want to tell us a little bit

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
about this little beauty piece? Oh,

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,959
yeah. This rig um it's a Canadian glass

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,880
blower. He actually out of the city. Uh

29
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,319
his name is Tank Glass. Uh you can check

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,679
him out on Instagram. I believe his

31
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,158
handle is tank glass. Um he's got a cool

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,000
little crew of guys over in East Van. Uh

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,240
I think it's East Bam Flame Works is

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,200
their uh shop that they're out of. Uh

35
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,478
and I I was at the Canadian Glass

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,320
Gathering up in Burke uh Bergen BC and

37
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,560
uh I guess he was showcasing some of his

38
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,319
glass there and um in between some of

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
the judging and stuff. I went over and

40
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,919
checked out the glass table and this

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
pomegranate piece just was like shining

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
in the light. It's a beauty, dude. Man,

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
I thought it was a really nice color and

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,158
I kind of been looking at a pomegranate

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
piece. Like I don't really have any

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,600
heavy glass except for this piece right

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,040
now and it was just it was it was a

48
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,559
really nice little piece and the opal in

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,640
the front has done really well. Did he

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,280
do the drop down as well? He did. Uh the

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,118
drop down wasn't made uh with the piece,

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,040
but I actually hit him up on Instagram a

53
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,399
few months ago. I was just like, "Hey

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
man, it was just kind of I want to put

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,159
my dail in there, you know, cuz it's a

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
cool little piece." Yeah. Uh, so he he

57
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,520
custom made me a drop down, same color.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,280
Uh, and he actually matched an opal on

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,719
top of it just to match the front. It's

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,919
all really nice. It looks like it was

61
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,199
blown with the pipe. Definitely match. I

62
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,519
can't say anything bad about it. It's

63
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,839
it's it's perfect. I like the size at

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
the bottom. Like the BK. I was like,

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,039
give me the female toy. I want the big

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
one. It's funny cuz it's just a little

67
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,519
tender on the top. So 10 to 18. 10 to

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
18. That's what's so unique about it.

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,480
Really? It's totally custom. It's It's a

70
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,598
cool little piece. And uh I hope he

71
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,840
makes some more of them cuz I would get

72
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,119
a few colors if he if he did. You should

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
try it. This is the one I'm not

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,759
touching, right? Yeah, you can smoke

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
this one though. Perfect. Well, I'm

76
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,239
going to try it right now. Why not? I

77
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,719
mean, beautiful little piece tank glass.

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,120
This is some Hindu Kush was grown grown

79
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,479
by True True Genetics. Uh you did a

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
really nice job with this stuff. It came

81
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,000
out beautiful. Yeah. Tastes crazy. When

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,080
he showed it to me at first, it smelled

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
like like almost funky like a almost

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,560
like a cheese smell, but really Yeah,

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
it's it's beautiful. I love the Hindu.

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,000
All right. Well, here we go through the

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,400
tank glass with the True Genetics with

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,400
the West Coast concentrate. Pop

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Wednesday.

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Yeah, this stuff definitely smells It's

91
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,959
kind of cheesy. A little funky, a little

92
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:26,518
cheesy, but definitely like

93
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,439
um I don't

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:33,120
know. What do you think? Almost cushy.

95
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,199
Well, it's Hindu cush. I know, but the

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,439
what what overpowers it? The Hindu or

97
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,199
the the cheese?

98
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,039
It's not as cheesy actually now as it

99
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,878
was when when it first came out as

100
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,280
fresh. Yeah, but it is still a little

101
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:50,000
bit funky. I have a Q-tip for you. So,

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,199
yeah, that smells nice. Well, I sure

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,039
don't mind cleaning my surface.

104
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm done hitting it. Proper dab

105
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,679
etiquette.

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,680
Someone should write a book on that.

107
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Yeah.

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,000
It's probably in the midst of being

109
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,839
public. Step one, do not grab the nail

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,759
to clear the bowl. Don't do that. Don't

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
put your lips on the nail. Don't put

112
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,840
your lips on the nail. When you put your

113
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,840
lips on the bong, don't put them over

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,519
the bong like you're giving your head.

115
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,279
It's not your boyfriend. Just put your

116
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
lips right in there, nice and tight, and

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,599
get it going. Exactly. Uh the good fun

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,199
that we uh that we have here on Puff

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,120
Wednesdays. Cheers, guys. Very tasty.

120
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040
Very nice little pipe. Ripped really

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,560
well. I mean, obviously for my liking, I

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
would like to have a nail on there that

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,879
was a little less Oh, for sure. You

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,120
know, a nice secure nail would just be

125
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,439
like Yeah. And honestly, we could

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,918
definitely put it in

127
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,399
the the actual palm glass, but I just

128
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,680
have it in a reducer because I just I

129
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,599
kind of want to keep the drop down.

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,319
This is just a little bit hard, I think.

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Oh, for sure. Size the uh the whip

132
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,279
itself. pipe. We've also got the Taurus

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,918
going on here with the uh Cory Tottenham

134
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,000
drop down the rosta drop. Yes. Great job

135
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,399
that he did. Actually, this pipe won

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,959
third to third prize for best glass at

137
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,478
the cannabis cup in high times. Kind of

138
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,159
hilarious. We were just like we didn't

139
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,758
even uh really they came up and were

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,039
like, "Do you want to enter that pipe?"

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,199
And we were like, "I guess we want to."

142
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,599
Sure. I'm sure enough people got a got a

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
puff off of it to know. Definitely.

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Everyone got a puff off of it, you know,

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,840
between uh Tony and myself. He had his

146
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,199
Fabra egg there, so a lot of people were

147
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,519
hitting that as well. Oh, beautiful

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,000
pieces. But yeah, it was definitely on

149
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,359
point for um Here, why don't you hit

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,279
this one or do you want to also hit the

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,520
I'll hit the I'm used to I'm used to the

152
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,679
It's nice and close. A nice change. I've

153
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,240
grown to love the Taurus. Yeah, I'm

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,600
sorry. No, I was I was quite enjoying it

155
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,478
actually before it started to smell like

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,120
that. Yeah, I was saying I was like the

157
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,758
first the first couple of whiffs I know

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,639
were like really nice and then and then

159
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,639
right as you said I'm sorry I smelled

160
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,319
the like oh now it's gone past where

161
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,079
it's due and it's not good when you

162
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,639
that's what he's smelling. Yeah, that's

163
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,079
the the Q-tip pushing. So check check

164
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,319
this out guys. These guys from Improv

165
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:22,399
Advan Enhanced Vaping sent me this

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,120
little tool called the dipstick. Now, I

167
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,959
saw it on Instagram originally, and I

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,439
wasn't quite sure exactly what it was

169
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,038
when I received it recently. It's uh,

170
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,879
you know, here it comes in a nice little

171
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,478
kind of iPhone style box. And there's

172
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,000
the unit right here. Mostly it's a

173
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,918
battery.

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,918
I wasn't sure exactly what it was. I

175
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,918
thought at first that it was going to be

176
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,240
like a ceramic tip that you would just

177
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,680
heat bowls up with, you know, you could

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,400
Yeah, like herb iron or something. Like

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
an herb iron or um Oh jeez, what are the

180
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,839
other names? The Fedor was the original

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,600
one. And now there's a new company

182
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,279
called Glow Stick. I've seen that Glow

183
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,879
Stick. Very cool. Kyle Kushman had one.

184
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,918
And in fact, the company told me

185
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,598
recently that they were going to be

186
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,719
sending me one. So when I first got

187
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,918
this, I almost thought it was that. But

188
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
this is actually something quite

189
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,478
different. This is It comes with these

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,319
two little heads that simply screw onto

191
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,639
the

192
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,400
top and uh it's pretty simple. Quality

193
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,478
is definitely there. Like would you say

194
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,359
just from the feel it's a lot heavier

195
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,120
than I expected it to be but

196
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,360
not over heavy. Like it's probably about

197
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
the weight of a large cell phone. I'd

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,319
say it's pretty damn close. You're

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,919
right.

200
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,199
But it definitely feels quality. It

201
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,639
feels like something right. And then

202
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,680
also, one of the things I liked right

203
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,000
away was this

204
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,598
magnetic top that my 15-year-old son

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,759
couldn't open. And I watched him like

206
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,639
trying to literally pull it apart. I was

207
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,759
like, I like that that if it does get

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
slightly childproof. Well, I mean, it's

209
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,560
definitely hard to pull this little cap

210
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,520
off. You can check it out yourself

211
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
there. So, um, I did give it a single

212
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,478
shot the other night, but I thought, you

213
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,240
know, while we were here, we could

214
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,478
potentially, uh, you know, put something

215
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,400
down on glass and, uh, see if we

216
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,719
couldn't have a few hits out of it. Do

217
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,839
we need anything like a special glass? I

218
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
mean, we're not going to be hitting it

219
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,038
for that long really. So, just something

220
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,560
that'll clean easily and, uh, yeah, just

221
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,159
like a glass surface, you know, on a

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,839
dish. I should have brought a dish cuz I

223
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,639
have these little glass dishes, but even

224
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,478
a plate would probably be fine. Um, I

225
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
guess what you do with it is you hit it

226
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,800
much like a nectar collector. You just

227
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,598
push the button, it goes orange and then

228
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,038
the mouthpiece is literally the other

229
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,319
end and it has Let me just show these

230
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,559
guys up on the camera so they can

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,240
actually see this thing. So, there's the

232
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,038
dipstick. This is the little piece that

233
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,200
screws on. And it's uh pretty pretty

234
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,278
quality the way it screws on. Definitely

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
feels pretty good. And then when you

236
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,000
hold the button down, um, you get a nice

237
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,159
bright orange coil. That's, uh, it's

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,559
probably a titanium coil wrapped in a

239
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,559
ceramic head. Uh, and then there's the

240
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,799
mouthpiece. So, if you pull that off,

241
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,399
this is the battery component. So, if

242
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,958
you unscrew that, you got your battery.

243
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,039
But then this is just a single hole that

244
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,278
goes through the entire unit and comes

245
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,759
to the end of here. So, much like a

246
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,838
nectar collector, you would hit this

247
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,439
while igniting it. I mean, I guess what

248
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,080
it's really like is it's like an

249
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
external vape pen. Yeah. You know, cuz

250
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
we've got uh you know, I think I even

251
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,159
have one on me right here. The good

252
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,278
folks at Atmos kick this down at the Oh,

253
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,480
I hope I didn't lose my little your coil

254
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,720
or your mouthpiece. My little

255
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
mouthpiece. Probably in my truck or at

256
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,200
home, I'm sure. But anyway, I don't need

257
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,000
the mouthpiece to see this. Anyway,

258
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
um just this is a similar unit in the

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,720
sense that um you know, the coil, this

260
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,720
piece is inside here. And then what this

261
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
company did, they covered it with a

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,639
ceramic disc. So, you can't really see

263
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,560
well right now because I have a little

264
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,000
piece

265
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,679
of it's got a ceramic disc in the

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,799
bottom. So, you can't even see when it's

267
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,799
heating up. It's just a ceramic uh disc

268
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,479
that starts heating up and boiling uh

269
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,319
the hash and the oil in there. So, it's

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,000
a lot cleaner than whatever metal some

271
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
companies have been using from the past.

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,679
Yeah, exactly. Ready for you. Awesome.

273
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
All right. Well, I'll close this bad boy

274
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,599
up and hopefully I can find the little

275
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,080
the little head on that. I was kind of

276
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,399
uh I'm sure it's around kind of shock.

277
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,120
But I think though Atmos uh I believe

278
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,360
that they actually sell like just the

279
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,039
the top key. Oh yeah. No, they do for

280
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,879
sure. Something easily. They have all

281
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,759
the components for sure. So I guess what

282
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,480
we should do is take a little rip with

283
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:27,039
this dipstick. The dipstick. So this is

284
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,879
the first time trying. I mean I tried it

285
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,519
mildly. I'm going to say this is really

286
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:35,759
my first real shot at it. So let's see

287
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,759
what we can uh see what we can do here.

288
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,320
Seems to work pretty good. Sucked it up

289
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,319
pretty good.

290
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Definitely got a nice tasty hit. Yeah,

291
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
it seemed low temp. See if there's more

292
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,000
in there.

293
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,919
Maybe a little bit. Tiniest little bit,

294
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,519
but it actually took it in real nice.

295
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,958
You didn't waste much. And it didn't

296
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,200
look like it was too hot of a hit, which

297
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,879
is which is my problem with most of

298
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
these. Well, I mean, I looked at all

299
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,679
these things for a variety of reasons. I

300
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,799
love the idea of finding something that

301
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,479
I can fit into my daily life in some way

302
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,319
or shape or another. When I'm at my

303
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
office, when I'm at my house, when I'm

304
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
with friends, my D nail is my go-to

305
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,120
unit. It plugs into my mothership. You

306
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,838
know, I've got old variety of nails.

307
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,159
It's the way I love to smoke. And, you

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,120
know, to a degree that was a nice rip.

309
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:30,078
Yeah. And to a degree with um even with

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,000
a torch and banger. I brought a a banger

311
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,278
collection today. I brought three quartz

312
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,200
bangers, all different sizes, and one

313
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,559
titanium banger. I figured while we were

314
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,800
out there in the world, we could just

315
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,039
hit the variety of Yeah, I brought the

316
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,879
infinity with just a little awesome cap

317
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,519
so we can hit at least that. But if you

318
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,360
got bang upset about that, I figured I'd

319
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,799
bring

320
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,959
some the glass or the quartz ones are

321
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:57,359
from DC Glass and the DC uh the titanium

322
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,119
one is from Dail. It's a real real nice

323
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,600
piece. They did uh they did nice work on

324
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,639
it. So, it's a flat. It very much looks

325
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,120
like um that nail right there. This one?

326
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,039
Yeah. But the hole is on the side of it

327
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,039
and it screws into the base of the nail.

328
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,799
And the nail is really well done. It's

329
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,039
uh it's a 144 but it's like titanium

330
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,879
exactly what quartz would look like but

331
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,879
done in all titanium. So, it's like so

332
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,439
it's like a frosted joint. Yeah. It

333
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,600
fits. Yeah. It's really nice. Like the I

334
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,880
like that they did this with the slits.

335
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,040
Yeah. um because it's it it cools it

336
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,639
like the nail down a little keeps your

337
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,159
joint also a little bit cooler. But if

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,919
they do something the same way, maybe

339
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,679
like higher up on the nail. I think

340
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,799
we'll see it soon, but for sure it'll

341
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,638
definitely help with the cooling. Well,

342
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,240
the thickness of the titanium nail when

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,079
I show it to you and the flatness of the

344
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,240
top of the head. It's really the only

345
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,078
titanium nail I haven't been worried

346
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,039
about putting directly into my mother

347
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,439
ship and and hitting because it never

348
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,679
gets hot at the bottom. The bottom is so

349
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
thick and big. That's good to know that.

350
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,159
I mean, I'm sure you could get it hot if

351
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,078
you just held the

352
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,519
but you don't need to. So, I mean,

353
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,199
that's one of the reasons I use a drop

354
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,320
down. Obviously, mother ships are not

355
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,759
cheap bongs. And the idea of a metal

356
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,680
expanding uh in your glass joint is a

357
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,000
somewhat sickening thought. Even losing

358
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,719
my drop down would be a bummer, but a

359
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,879
lot less is a bummer than losing the

360
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,959
ship. That's for sure. Yeah, for sure.

361
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,759
That was a nice hit. Not bad. Right. So,

362
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,319
it's like something was expecting a more

363
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:33,039
harsh experience, I suppose. Uh, but it

364
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:36,800
was nice. I definitely like the idea of

365
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:38,958
this being able to almost work through

366
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,919
like a bubbler or something. Yeah. You

367
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,679
know what I mean? And I don't know how

368
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,679
that works. I'm a We're big water guys,

369
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,679
too. Me, too. Very big water guy. Yet,

370
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,879
at the same time, we need it on the go

371
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,559
on the mountain. I'm on the top of the

372
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,240
mountain. if I'm like out on the boat

373
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,479
and the d nail is not working or the

374
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,440
battery stop, it's very nice to have

375
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,199
some product that uh that you know that

376
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,320
you can get a nice rip off of. And I

377
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:02,799
guess the idea of having your rosin in a

378
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,720
small little like glass lid that you

379
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:09,359
just open up, flip upside down, and go

380
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,399
that's definitely potential for uh we'll

381
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
see how it does on the mountain. You

382
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,759
know, that'll be really the true test

383
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,319
for me as a product. How well does it

384
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,838
heat up and cool down in a minus15

385
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,240
degree temperature? You need to just go

386
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,320
get like a little glass jar. Like a one

387
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,720
gram glass jar. The jars. The jars. Jars

388
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,040
are plastic on the outside and on the

389
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,600
inside it's glass. It's the best of both

390
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,879
worlds. Exactly. Shatter. Hopefully. You

391
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
don't want to be breaking that glass

392
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,000
while you're uh uh while you're out on

393
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,119
the mountain. That's for sure. That's

394
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,039
why you know when I brought the turpps

395
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,560
I bring that. Well, this is the the hash

396
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,360
that I got from you. And then this is uh

397
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,198
this is inserts. Oh man. Some some G4

398
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,879
Gorilla Glue number four. There's some

399
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,799
lemon.

400
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,480
And let me see what I got. I got golden

401
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,399
goat.

402
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,159
Shout out to Tony. Well, you know what?

403
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,759
Shout out to everyone in the Turk land.

404
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,759
Let's uh you know, shout out to Ethan

405
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,639
Russo. Shout out to K from Tricom

406
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,319
Technology who was really um he was

407
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,159
really one of the first people, one of

408
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,079
the first people I say because skunk man

409
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,919
Sam was the first person to ever talk to

410
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,319
me about tarpen. that probably goes back

411
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,319
about 12 years. Uh he was the first one

412
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,800
to show me pure tarpen although not

413
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,040
derived from cannabis plants. Uh we were

414
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:25,039
still able to see the modulating effects

415
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:27,360
of those tarpen on um on canabonoids in

416
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,919
their pure form. Golden goat. I just

417
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,000
want to say by the way that this gorilla

418
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,120
smells amazing. Try your scope cookies.

419
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,078
I'm blue. Wow. Damn. This is the one you

420
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,320
were doing on uh church or not church

421
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:44,399
periscope the other day. Look, Jack

422
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,320
looks empty, but watch as the tarpen up

423
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,120
like condenses back into They start to

424
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,759
appear now. That's crazy. That is just

425
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
stuck on the side or what? It's probably

426
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,519
It's right in the back. Yeah. Let's see

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,919
what else we got. We got Irene OG We got

428
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,919
Sour Diesel.

429
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,480
That uh Girl Scout smells phenomenal.

430
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,239
Yeah, it's definitely on point. Is that

431
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:15,039
what that was? G4. G4. I think the west

432
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:18,079
for 64. I No, I got That's a gorilla.

433
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:20,559
Yeah, that's crazy. Golden goat.

434
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,239
Wow. Golden goat. Yeah, that's the one

435
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,000
he had on church and you couldn't

436
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,959
explain like what it smells like and I

437
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
can't explain what it smells like

438
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,679
either. Wow. They're all very unique to

439
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,680
the tree. They all are very unique. So,

440
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,278
why don't we um each take a dab of the

441
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,120
one that you want to take a dab with.

442
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,639
You can uh hit it with rosin or with

443
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,198
bubble. And we'll just do a quick little

444
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,839
dip on on whichever one that bubble

445
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:47,838
grabbed you the most. Uh let's do bubble

446
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,680
with uh that that gorilla. The G4. Yeah.

447
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,920
I got to choose the G4, too, I think.

448
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,838
And that and the last one you showed me,

449
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,078
too. Try the Blue Dream. Crazy. Blue

450
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,759
Dream. Blue Dream. That's a commercial

451
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,120
strain, yet it's one of the headier

452
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,879
commercial strains. It's the one people

453
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
in California make money off of. They

454
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,959
grow it. It's it's kind of like their

455
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,558
hash plant of the '9s where the majority

456
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,519
of people can actually pull off a nice

457
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,199
product with this strain and uh but you

458
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,879
know a lot of heady people just call it

459
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,279
a commercial strain. Well, I have to say

460
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,600
like I've personally never smelled

461
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,359
turppines that were actually derived

462
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,438
from cannabis

463
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,678
and like it's definitely better than I

464
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,919
expected. Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

465
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,640
Yeah, it is the first experience I've

466
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,960
had with Let me pull that

467
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,120
with cannabis derived turkeys. We're

468
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,319
doing it. We're doing it. Let me get

469
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,519
her. Actually, go ahead. Go ahead.

470
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,279
Don't want to put my finger in there.

471
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,440
No, just leave me when I photograph it.

472
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,879
I do have I'm like the most careful. You

473
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,160
know what? You can have this if you

474
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,400
would like it. I don't know. Oh, really?

475
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,798
Definitely use. I need a glass one. Ah,

476
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
yeah, definitely. This is This is how

477
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:01,000
we'll do it. We'll just do the press and

478
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:06,678
dip. Yes, the press and dip. I've

479
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,679
pressed. Um, yeah. Go ahead.

480
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,000
This is like Christmas. This is an early

481
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,240
Christmas present. Definitely for

482
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,960
us. Thank you

483
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,720
for for a treat, Mr. Paul. Yeah. Shout

484
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,558
out to anyone who had anything to do

485
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,400
with with this with coming this far. We

486
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,319
all did.

487
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,840
Cheers.

488
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,359
Nice. I love being in the middle of this

489
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,038
right now. It's such a wonderful thing.

490
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,119
Both of these guys being the heady kind

491
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,038
of guys that they are hitting the pure

492
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,879
turpps for the, you know, for them for

493
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,919
the first time. You know, people like

494
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,400
Kay and people like uh uh Skunkman Sam

495
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,880
and now, you know, Tony and and and

496
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,559
Horatio and many others. Mike from Keon

497
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,960
Genetics and probably 20 or 30 Instagram

498
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,798
accounts where people are starting we'll

499
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,279
even play around with their microwave

500
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,000
distillation or their steam distillation

501
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,759
or their hydro dusion whatever whatever

502
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,279
they have available to them. It's uh

503
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,400
it's definitely neat to see people

504
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:07,119
exploring and learning more about the

505
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,640
differences of a tarpine profile. I look

506
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,599
forward to the days where we can take

507
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,038
these profiles and split them into their

508
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:15,519
fractions and literally be like, "Whoa."

509
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,480
Like, smell smell them all at once and

510
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,599
kind of say, see how I guess I better

511
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,440
join you guys on the comp.

512
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,119
That was fun. What did we just try?

513
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,640
What's your effect? Is that the G4?

514
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,959
Yeah. Yeah, that was the Gorilla Glue

515
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,280
with the full spectrum. It's so It's

516
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,679
super heavy. The effect is super heavy.

517
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,678
Yeah, it's definitely like top of the

518
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,280
forehead. Yeah, that was some nice hash,

519
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,798
but those turppines definitely

520
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,000
definitely did something else. They

521
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,319
change it up a little, don't they?

522
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,279
Definitely. I like that. Well, for us,

523
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:51,200
cuz we've we get to smoke that strain

524
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:54,839
all the time in that full spec. So then

525
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,440
we kind of know, man. Yeah, that's

526
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,599
phenomenal. What do you even same thing?

527
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
Uh yeah, just stay on the same page as

528
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:05,439
everyone.

529
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,440
It's not a bad page to do.

530
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,440
Damn, just got a hit from the hit.

531
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,440
That's going to be insane.

532
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,480
That was definitely one of the more

533
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,280
enjoyable dive experiences I've had. Um,

534
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,640
especially for for Fullmelt. Just to be

535
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,879
able to add cannabis derived tarpines is

536
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,720
always a blessing.

537
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,320
Well, it's just an it's just something

538
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,919
that, you know, not a lot of people have

539
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,399
really experienc

540
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,520
experienced. I don't even pretend to

541
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,080
know. You know, we'll have to learn

542
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,679
about the tarpen and the safety factor

543
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,759
of inhaling them with canabonoids

544
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,840
because there I guarantee you will be

545
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,480
certain tarpen that we might not want to

546
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,079
be doing this with. And there'll be

547
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,679
other ones that are just so clearly

548
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,599
something that we want to be doing it

549
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,519
with. I love the taste of it on my lips.

550
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,119
Yes. Like that one. It's phenomenal.

551
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,440
Yeah, it goes right down your throat.

552
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,959
It's just so ridiculous. So, so here's

553
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,919
here's a segue that I was actually going

554
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
to ask you about earlier.

555
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:13,880
U this is just like, you know, being

556
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,879
stoned and [ __ ] but yeah,

557
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,120
distillate versus something that has

558
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,880
turppines in it. Mhm. Would that be

559
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:25,119
something potentially that like uh a dog

560
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,360
would would not be able to smell

561
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,599
distillate? Is it the canabonoids or is

562
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,079
it Oh, yeah. It's karaophylene in fact

563
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,480
that drug dogs are tested with which are

564
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,000
the most Yeah. It's the It's the tarpine

565
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,640
karaophylene which is the most

566
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,519
prevalent. It's the one that like it's

567
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,038
it it gets out even in bag bagged weed

568
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,000
like it escapes the the smell of

569
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:48,079
everything. Yeah. It just saturates.

570
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,400
It's light. it floats out and it's just

571
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,960
uh it evaporates at you know below room

572
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,880
temperatures and uh it seems to have a

573
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,038
longlasting effect in the sense that

574
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,600
certain tarpines can boil out very fast

575
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,960
and be gone. Karaophylene although it

576
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,119
evaporates out it still stays present

577
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,519
and I think that's one of the main

578
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,959
reasons why they uh train drugs with

579
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,079
that. Hopefully in the near future they

580
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
won't have to worry. Yeah, that's what I

581
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,519
was going to say is it's not really a

582
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,000
big deal, I guess, going forward, but

583
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,679
it, you know, is an interesting, it just

584
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
was a thought I had. Yeah. Yeah. No,

585
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
it's definitely an interesting thought.

586
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,919
We should uh we should pick up this

587
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,798
party, head out into Puff Wednesday, see

588
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,440
what characters we bump into out there

589
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:32,720
and uh you know, obviously get them uh

590
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,440
get them all turkey. Yeah, let's do it.

591
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,679
Let's do it. All right, so we just ended

592
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,320
up here downtown. We're kind of in the

593
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,640
parking lot next to the Cirus Salet

594
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,240
right behind uh BC Stadium, BC Place.

595
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,200
And I guess these guys have a good

596
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,038
little spot for us to go check

597
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,120
out. We got Science World across the

598
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:57,839
way. And

599
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:00,959
uh what about a dock session? Yeah,

600
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:04,279
whatever, man. Dog session. Let's do a

601
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,279
dog session.

602
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,559
I guess there is a chance that it's

603
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,558
locked though. Hey, there definitely is.

604
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,798
Should we bother or should we just go to

605
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,519
where you're where you are going to take

606
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,679
us?

607
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,679
We will puff.

608
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,519
We will puff on puff Wednesday. We will

609
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,120
definitely puff on Puff Wednesday.

610
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,038
Taking you to Narnia. Narnia. Narnia in

611
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,439
the city. Narnia. Watch out for the

612
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,158
syringe and the condom.

613
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,679
I [ __ ] left those.

614
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,000
It's all good, man. It's all good.

615
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:47,440
You're not pistol. Just shoot it.

616
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,960
You see that VPD report? I saw it. The

617
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,558
shatter one. Yeah. And then they

618
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,400
retract. Then I saw Kirk and Dana

619
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,399
destroy them. Yeah. They retracted. And

620
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,360
then they retracted it. Yeah. So that

621
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,240
was good.

622
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,240
Yeah. You can go wherever.

623
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,400
Oh, I see. Right. Right. This is good.

624
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah. Down here. This is kind of like a

625
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:14,600
little pathway. Little nook and cranny.

626
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,600
More than one right there.

627
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,679
He's looking at us.

628
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,480
All right, I'm coming down. I almost

629
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,038
feel bad that we're interrupting your

630
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,038
serenity. It'll be short.

631
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,520
All right, guys. This is beautiful. This

632
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,519
is great.

633
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,840
Oh, you're good.

634
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,240
All right. Well, we made it to our

635
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:54,519
outdoor spot. First spot to have a

636
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,278
session at. What is this? Like,

637
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,599
uh, open this little Is that Granville

638
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,798
right there? Uh, yes it is. Granville

639
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,240
Street Bridge. So, we're really close to

640
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,440
the Granville Street Bridge. Right in

641
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120
between Granville Street Bridge and

642
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,038
Science World. And basically, right

643
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:11,678
beside uh BC Stadium, BC Place, our

644
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,119
stadium, our big big unit. There's a

645
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,159
Science World is in the background. And

646
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:19,278
basically, we're here

647
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:22,240
to smoke a dab, hit a dab each, and then

648
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,079
split to go eat some food. Uh, we might

649
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,440
eat downtown. We might end up heading

650
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,918
over to Commercial Drive where D420K is

651
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,679
at and uh go have a session with him and

652
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,840
go see eat some food with him depending

653
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,240
on

654
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:38,240
uh depending on what happens.

655
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:47,759
Dabs. I got that hot torch. So, we're

656
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,519
hitting out of the tank glass. Pretty

657
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,119
pretty sweet day for, you know, for a

658
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,879
day that was actually considered fairly

659
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,079
cool. It's only a couple of degrees

660
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,440
above zero right now. Maybe five or six.

661
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,678
But there's some warmth in the sun,

662
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,440
isn't there? There is definitely a

663
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
little walk on fairies going by right

664
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,759
now. That looks pretty sweet. Comes from

665
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,880
Van uh Grandville Island, correct? Yeah,

666
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,319
I think they all leave from there and

667
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,919
they have a bunch of different Yeah.

668
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,240
Bunch of spots downtown where they pick

669
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,759
them up. Thank you.

670
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,640
Very sweet. Well, I'm definitely looking

671
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,558
forward to a dab and then grab some food

672
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,799
and see where this Puff Wednesday leads

673
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:20,798
us.

674
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,359
a little big. All right. Well, it is

675
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,759
what it is. It is what it is. It is what

676
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,158
it is. Game off. What kind of time you

677
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,158
waiting on that?

678
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,080
Pretty cold out. So, I think I would

679
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,918
just hit it. It can't be that hot. I

680
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,480
didn't.

681
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,200
That looks perfect. And that fits right

682
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,159
on top of that. Perfect. Damn. We got to

683
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,159

691
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,159
little walk-on fairies that are driving

692
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,759
by. They remind me of like a little

Popeye the Sailor Man uh

694

00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,239
Good to meet you. I'm Mark Brett.

806
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,239
Brett West Coast concentrate cruise and

807
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:57,279
make all the extract. So, I'm doing

808
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:02,559
flour rosia and I give it to you in

809
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,560
Irene OG. So this uh should

810
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:11,839
[Music]

811
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:13,679
be still vaporizing off the

812
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,380
Oh yeah.

813
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,319
Taste is unreal on that. Right.

814
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,800
[Music]

815
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,440
Wow. That wasn't even a huge hit. A very

816
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,359
like reasonable size. The first time you

817
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,519
tried so it does kind of choke you up.

818
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,519
It does.

819
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,078
It's just okay. And I find that the the

820
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,679
latter hits of it aren't quite as like

821
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,680
sharp.

822
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:40,679
Y presc.

823
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,118
[Music]

824
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,119
Yeah, we we can bring one for you if you

825
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,200
want.

826
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,838
We'll give you then a much smaller one.

827
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,838
Small if you want.

828
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,919
We'll go real small.

829
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,079
We'll go so small it'll be mostly for

830
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,079
the flavor.

831
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,059
[Applause]

832
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,400
It doesn't matter.

833
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,320
Does that look good?

834
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,320
[Music]

835
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,159
I've never tasted anything like that

836
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,719
before. That's like Wow. Awesome. Well,

837
00:37:54,159 --> 00:38:00,319
there we go.

838
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:03,598
You serve up the hit accordingly.

839
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:08,480
He wanted one of those.

840
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,800
I take what I get. I take what I want.

841
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,559
Thanks, guys.

842
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,079
All right. And we want to get you up

843
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,639
next.

844
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,640
And we're going to give

845
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,299
[Applause]

846
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:33,109
[Music]

847
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,240
It is the sun.

848
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,639
Nice. Did you like that?

849
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,689
Awesome.

850
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,920
Yeah.

851
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:15,760
[Music]

852
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,519
Yeah. This definitely gives you that. In

853
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,520
fact, I guarantee you if Miles and Marcy

854
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,320
would lick their lips right now, they

855
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,880
would taste the turppines that they just

856
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:31,760
had a still there. It's a

857
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,760
nice super nice uplifted. So that's

858
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,119
really cool.

859
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,320
It's incredible.

860
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,800
I think it's slowly but surely catching

861
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:56,039
on. The cleanest product you can make

862
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:01,480
with the slight modulation like pure

863
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:01,480
extract and uh boom, there it is.

864
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,559
The science has been 40 or 50 years now.

865
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,560
like slowly

866
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,358
people start.

867
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,980
[Music]

868
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,680
[Applause]

869
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,759
Does anyone in here want to try these

870
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:43,118
pure extracted turppines with some

871
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,400
bubble hash or flour rosin?

872
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,400
The pure

873
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,550

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,760
this here. Then you'll

877
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,760
get

878
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:20,879
[Music]

879
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,880
that little bit of

880
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,318
this. That's why we just create an

881
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:37,318
enjoyable experience for everyone. Yeah,

882
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:42,440
[Music]

883
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,440
does make it

884
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:02,000
look that was a very

885
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,000
she was

886
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,759
daddy, Right.

00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,920
different.

00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:19,789
[Music]

890
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,318
Turkey to share with you folks.

891
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:38,590
Yeah. Just Oh yeah. Yeah,

892
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:41,658
absolutely. Are you sure

893
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,659
[Music]

894
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,920
about this?

895
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:59,719
So I think I think this is going to be

896
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:59,719
I think it is so legal.

897
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,519
Oh, I can almost taste it from here.

898
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,119
Once you open a bunch of jars, too, you

899
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,119
somehow end up with your head.

00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,760
Yeah. But I do

like this one.

906
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960

none of the

00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:33,480
why. Let's find out.

938
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,079
You could it would

00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,599
be so this week.

00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:55,800
1,700 when the bottles full.

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Wow.

942
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,318
Did you say?

943
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,639
Yeah. For one of these vials.

944
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,358
So it's just like it's just pure

945
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,559
turppines. For instance, like rose

946
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:16,880
essence is worth

947
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:20,799
$20,000 a year.

948
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,800
Yeah, it's expensive. Roses, 20,000, but

949
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,760
this is cannabis. So, people taking

950
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,800
pounds of herb and then extracting just

951
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,800
these turppines from it.

952
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,760
Becomes a pretty expensive hobby. Yes,

953
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,160
it does. Depending on what
