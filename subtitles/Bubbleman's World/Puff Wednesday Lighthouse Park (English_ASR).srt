00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,679
one of the things I've been doing lately

217
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:29,119
is I have been heating my Banger way

218
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:30,599
less than usual like heating it barely

219
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,120
at all at all like a 10 Johnny's kind of

220
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
tripping out cuz he just did that squish

221
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,000
where you get nothing and you're like

222
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,320
what the [ __ ] [ __ ] just happened just

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,120
happened nothing you'll figure it out

224
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,959
maybe let it get a little hotter you

225
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,679
know what I'm I'm on the wrong side I'm

226
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,239
done I'm on the wrong side this is going

227
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:50,159
to be loud I'll heat this up for a few

228
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,159
seconds and uh we'll have a nice little

229
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,759
dab that's a 10-second

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,159
heater well you know we don't have to

231
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,919
heat it up for a minute I mean if you

232
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,278
need to clean it you do if you burnt the

233
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,799
[ __ ] out of it and you need to burn

234
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,679
everything off then yeah you're going to

235
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,078
be required to uh that's a real small

236
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,559
little Banger you got there you like

237
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,599
that little 14 or a little tiny guy

238
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,719
looks even smaller than 14 Just Hits on

239
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,759
there like mine's a 14 is it but it's a

240
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
giant Banger yours would go inside

241
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,679
mine

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,919
whoa that's like dipping bangers yeah

243
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,120
we're definitely going I have to bong

244
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,559
rip this little rousing chip I can't

245
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,519
believe you just got nothing from that I

246
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,958
I know it used to be my favorite

247
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,799
squishing I think maybe it being in the

248
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:41,479
fridge for the last three months we

249
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,719
changed the something it's just weird

250
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,079
we're not going to discuss that though

251
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
actually maybe we should we should find

252
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,559
out if there is going to be a difference

253
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,879
L I'm taking a look at that I'm I'm

254
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,199
really super stoked I'm going to have to

255
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:55,958
heat mine up now I'm done here we

256
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,959
go I know what wrong with

257
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
me

258
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,000
do we have a bonger for you

259
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,639

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,360
I don't have one yet okay let me let me

261
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,720
sort you out Johnny B being sorted it's

262
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,759
most important part friends got other

263
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,399
friends backs well yeah even as you were

264
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,720
heating that up I wasn't sure I did I

265
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,639
sort something up there something's

266
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,920
going on cuz we want you get properly

267
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,198
dipped

268
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,479
dipping I wait a little bit longer on

269
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,958
that one cuz it's a smaller area the

270
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,879
trick with this guy is it's such a big

271
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,599
surface area you can get these perfect

272
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,000
perfect low temp dabs on it so you

273
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,120
notice how perfectly clean that is and

274
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,720
how mine is completely

275
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,720
destroyed

276
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,639

dips it's nice to let people know what's

300
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,759
going on but um well the problem is is

301
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,919
with the Instagram and with all these

302
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,240
platforms I mean right away when you're

303
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,958
trying to actually you're trying to I I

304
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,320
see a lot of the accounts being St down

305
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,479
from branding and trying to get new

306
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,440
products out there and the way that

307
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,159
things are being pushed on certain of

308
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,839
these platforms and and really all it

309
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,879
takes is one person to say you know what

310
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,240
I like him it's that simple and it's

311
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,120
that simple so one guy ruined it for

312
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,519
everybody it's kind of unfortunate it is

313
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,679
and it's amazing how those platforms

314
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,560
work it's one more reason not to be mean

315
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,120
and nasty to people on the internet cuz

316
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,239
they just you know it's that one guy

317
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,000
that's going to be like I'm going to go

318
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,799
out of my way and make your life

319
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,839
miserable and it

320
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,159
tastes I was a little bit miserable to

321
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,639
see how got no squish with

322
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,639
this first don't squish try try

323
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,919
again

324
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,399
so there was something that smoked out

325
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,559
of there there there little bit of smoke

326
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,399
in there I saw that too it's weird must

327
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,000
have missed a little area of cleaning it

328
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,799
looks perfect

329
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,519
but so this is nice and moist at least

330
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,519
it's not like John said

331
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,879
moist oh yeah these these low temp dabs

332
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,600
you can take them real quick after

333
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:26,919
heating it up I like that one more try

334
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,959
on the weed that's been in the freezer

335
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,479
for 4 months in a jar with Bova used to

336
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,719
squish quite nicely I'm pretty sure

337
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,959
you've seen it squish in the past and

338
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,959
now now I'm putting full force on this

339
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,519
sucker used to squish quite nicely I'm

340
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:46,838
pretty sure you've seen it squish in the

341
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,198
past and now now I'm put full force on

342
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,480
this

343
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:54,639
sucker I'm thinking that smells amazing

344
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,519
The Taste is so good like CU it's just

345
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,919
like I got that little how clean it was

346
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,679
too like

347
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,879
just yeah it's hard to explain the taste

348
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:07,239
on those on those beautiful tpin like

349
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,639
the Jamaican Sour Diesel is tasty making

350
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,839
me nervous over there Johnny I know I'm

351
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,839
just

352
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,360
like I didn't get anything from there

353
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,480
last

354
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,440
time I know it was weird it and now now

355
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,360
I've got it on an angle and I squished

356
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,319
it wrong and you can see I squish it on

357
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,720
the outside I didn't get a squish out of

358
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,838
it I completely I'm having no luck here

359
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,360

Be is having some problems today he

369
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,120
might have to get himself a

370
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,599
Sasquatch there you go but what's

371
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,519
happening right now I was trying to do a

372
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,000
squish on the go I'm have eaten maren

373
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,318
chips

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,640
oh hey pretty crunchy nothing like being

375
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:07,279
bummed out trying to squish something

376
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,079
and not getting anything out of it it

377
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,720
happened in Jamaica the first time Tony

378
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,078
and I were there it was substantial let

379
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,160
me load you out my piece here for your

380
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,078
dab I like that piece I have a

381
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,720
brothership made like

382
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,399
that and I can tell you right now it's

383
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,120
not the

384
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,400
same it looks the

385
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,439
same but I don't think it's exactly the

386
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
same well that's a nice way for people

387
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,880
that aren't going to ever you know

388
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,200
invest the money into the actual

389
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,480
Mothership to still be able to get

390
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,519
something I really really enjoy the ball

391
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,839
R grips and just the difference in the

392
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,519
Chug and the difference of the of the

393
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,918
hits on the different pipes and I think

394
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,519
you really start really realizing what

395
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,600
hits you get mhm the hits you get are

396
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:53,160
the hits you get Johnny B how about that

397
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,798
low temp dripped right down the middle

398
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,679
oh my God is that really nice looking

399
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:02,400
that's awesome just perfect

400
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,600
wow yeah that's a wower for sure oh

401
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,120
there we go see that last hit that you

402
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,038
took you literally decimated it it moved

403
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,719
right out of the circle and started

404
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,200
moving all around the pipe still hitting

405
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,960
like a

406
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,600
chant

407
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:24,400
wow that's what I call a well turned

408
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:27,079
rip the way just sat right in the middle

409
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,480
um I I really really wish that we

410
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:32,038
actually saw that up close cuz that for

411
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,839
us even we were kind of like wow that

412
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:37,158
was PR cool I can make a video you know

413
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,678
afterwards I'll just get time lapse that

414
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,760
sucker well you know it's slow motion I

415
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,600
think I know slow motion but that was it

416
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,440
was pretty cool on just watching the

417
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,359
difference between the low Temp dobs and

418
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,600
the it dropped right into the center of

419
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,439
the quartz perfectly and then it never

420
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,959
made it to the edges went and then it

421
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,798
sucked back up and went into it it

422
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,960
boiled lovely it's kind of when we look

423
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,879
at those um new bowls that do for tri

424
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,440
ping I guess it's kind of working in a

425
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,880
similar way how it's drawing up and

426
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,840
drawing back yeah there's just all these

427
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,320
different things that people are

428
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,798
thinking but if you think about what we

429
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,279
just saw yeah well that was the

430
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,038
directional that's how he decided that

431
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,119
guaranteed right Someone putting a carb

432
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,200
cap on and kind of moving it around

433
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,119
moves the oil or the melted hash around

434
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,640
in a circle so that's something I really

435
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,959
didn't even think of until right now

436
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,960
we'll make a video for you in the

437
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,679
meantime I think we really should get to

438
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,319
the park want to go the park the Sun's

439
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,720
shining the blue skies have come out I

440
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,599
think we were going to head into West

441
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,759
Vancouver we're going to check out one

442
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:37,558
of my favorite Parks which is Lighthouse

443
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:41,000
Park which is a park that requires a

444
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:43,158
little bit more of commitment and an

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,960
investment of time before you get to the

446
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,280
water White Cliff very quickly we were

447
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,919
at the water yes this one you walk

448
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,639
through a big forest and we'll be able

449
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,280
to potentially stop and have a couple of

450
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,038
sessions along the way before we get to

451
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,519
you know that end result which be I

452
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:57,759
think we're going on a bit of a hike

453
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,720
we're going on a bit of a hike and we're

454
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,798
going to have a Dr own and we're going

455
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,960
to have these cases tripods so it's

456
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,240
going to be kind of like one of those

457
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,159
hikes that's like damn we have a lot of

458
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,000
[ __ ] we should get someone from the

459
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
viewers to help us hike this stuff up

460
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,880
I'm telling you if anyone is local and

461

enjoying this hash you know what it's

471
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,240
beautiful flavor especially with the

472
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,798
turs and you know what like and I dabbed

473
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,960
it in the same turfs each

474
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,319
time I haven't even changed yours is uh

475

479
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,038
orange cream my favorite as a kid was

480
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,440
getting those orange creamsicles with

481
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,839
the with the with the vanilla ice cream

482
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,080
in the middle yeah it was my favorite

483
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:06,119
thing in world it was it wase but to me

484
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,319
a cream when I was a kid was orange and

485
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,119
it wasn't until later that I saw other

486
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,798
colors and was I was made purple and

487
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,038
green I was just like holy smokes like

488
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,079

colors cuz I just used to call them

490
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,359

00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,678
Johnny be I'm happy to see and the

493
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,519
bubble you know it's a little bit hotter

494
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,360
than usual I think I heated that up more

495
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,798
than 10 seconds so I like the 10c um put

496
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,079
your hand just above it and you'll feel

497
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,879
like it's almost burning yeah no not yet

498
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,759
too hot too hot yeah you don't want your

499
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,880
hand to burn because those are those

500
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,759
Turing don't need to be burned at at hot

501
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,360
heats they sure change drastically when

502
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,558
you hit them at that temperature and you

503
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,359
know the whole purpose not that say

504
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:50,918
changing them is a bad thing that might

505
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,000
be part of the experiment you're doing

506
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,038
in the bioassay and I'm sure there's

507
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,798
things to be found in that aspect that

508
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,879
are of value but for me I love the

509
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,278
preservation I love getting it as

510
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,720
authentic as it was given to me by the

511
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:06,720
plant in the first place that's why we

512
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,120
looked for extraction methods that are

513
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,120
we're pretty good to go I just touched

514
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,278
it

515
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,159
wow jeez good riing Johnny B it's so

516
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,559
it's just puddling on the bottom of the

517
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:38,600
quartz right now spinning around the

518
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:41,200
dish and uh bubbling and melting so

519
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:42,798
beautifully that uh that really only the

520
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,720
bubble hash and the dry sift of the

521
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,720
highest quality do you know you don't

522
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,919
get that same bubbling from uh rosin or

523
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,558
any type of oil you can get a foaming

524
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,880
from rosin but it's not like that

525
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:55,440
bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling

526
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,880
bubbling consistently it's quite

527
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,200
different and this will clean up so

528
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,120
perfect not in a rush for John to finish

529
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,798
his hit like I am sometimes if if it's

530
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,599
been hit too hot then it's like I really

531
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:10,679
just want to clean that off the the

532
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:13,959
quartz as as possible but but those low

533
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,400
CS like it's such a beautiful flavor and

534
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,640
then it's it's really those tpes like

535
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,798
you can taste them on the end of your

536
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,200
lips the flavor just it's

537
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,359
like it's like a creamsicle it's like

538
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,400
that when you have a creamsicle you have

539
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,399
that flavor at the end you finish that

540
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,159
cream you're like M that was so good

541
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,080
it's like m

542
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,039
well I'm going to join you with the

543
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,439
creamsicle if you don't mind oh please a

544
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,119
little creamsicle joining I'm a little I

545
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,759
I learned something new today I've

546
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,759
always been calling into my phone I

547
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,200
always like call you know pay by phone

548
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,000
call wait he what he means by pay by

549
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,000
phone is the parking in the city in

550
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,919
Vancouver we've got a fairly sort of

551
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,720
pretty cool system here in the sense

552
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,038
that you can use this app well before

553
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,600
the app was the call the phone in number

554
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:59,200
which is what he's been doing up until

555
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,639
about an hour ago

556
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,960
and I told him just download the app

557
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,919
dude you get the app and then you can

558
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,240
just punch in every parking space has a

559
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,919
number and I'll tell you for cities that

560
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,400
don't have it I used to get so many

561
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,080
parking tickets when I came into the

562
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,919
City and now I don't get them because my

563
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:19,678
phone basically sends me a text right be

564
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,559
5 minutes before the uh the parking is

565
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
going to expire so it's it's pretty

566
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:26,480
awesome I'm not going to lie it's pretty

567
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,479
awesome I love

568
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,558
it

569
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,798

570

what they believed in and the causes

588
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,119
that they believed in was fighting for

589
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,678
our freedom and that's a very big thing

590
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,719
that we fight for every day we fight for

591

freedom for this plant every day and

592
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,440

one dude so that'd be pretty epic

724
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,399
because it's part of memories and what

725
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,320
we share and what the culture does is we

726
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,599
share and we reminisce about the good

727
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,119
times and the awesome things that have

728
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,439
happened because of this amazing plant

729
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,518
when we just pull over on the side of a

730

trail and Blaze next to a monster tree

731
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,599

760
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,320

761
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,959
being a pretty big [ __ ] actually just

762
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,079
joking I'm K I'm Ken Johnny B is doing

763
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,440
the he's working it you know what he's

764
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,158
working it he's definitely we're just

765
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,639
having some comedy here off camera

766
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,960
that's why we thought we would turn the

767
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:41,558
camera on and give you a little bit of

768
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,880
that uh ridiculous Fe whoa on my face as

769
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:47,879
I trip down this treacherous Trail just

770
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,240
passed a big old tree just full of a

771
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,559
garon mushrooms I needed quite a little

772
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,558
education to some of there didn't he

773
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:55,839
look like they speak any English oh

774
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:57,839
really yeah they look kind of confused

775
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,879
all right so seven sister Trail and

776
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,278
Shore Pine Trail we need to find another

777
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,200
good spot this one's an uphill battle

778
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,159
though what do you say I see why we

779
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,319
should just make our own trail go that

780
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,760
way that is a trail the trail kind of

781
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,319
went around and went down this seems

782
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,319
like we're kind of on a like a river

783
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,000
bed doesn't it they went the other way

784
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,440
see even the dog goes the other way

785
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,440
without the

786
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:26,158
water we went that

787
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,319
way you think the do went that way we're

788
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,200
going this way are we yeah

789
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:34,200
this is the shortest way takes us to the

790
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,200
water and we can uh we can do a little

791
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,360
drone flying and a couple of

792
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,720
dabs we should have puffed those people

793
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,839
down from Argentina and Colombia that

794
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,120
would have been fun I think it would

795
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,119
have been

796
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:50,119
nice I think it would have been nice

797
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,919

00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,918
Argo and get there man we would get some

805
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,760
looks if we came in here with the Argo

806
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,280
we get in trouble they'd be tripping

807
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,159
they would call somebody they would not

808
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,119
be happy we would definitely be chased

809
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,480

about I'm not sure I've been this far

874
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,160
over in the park in a long time this is

875
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
where the

876
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,719
there used to be a camp here they have

877
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,280
these cabins and such that they rent out

878

job it's so much fun it is fun that was

1052
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:52,920
some epic stuff that we just witnessed

1053
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:58,719
it was good right so let's uh have some

1054
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,720
dabs let's do that yeah there

1055
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,519
check that [ __ ] up behind us whoa I was

1056
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,559
just talking about

1057
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:10,920
that I was talking about um this chair

1058
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,200
and behind this is roughly about a 30ft

1059
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,358
drop and and we're not but beyond that

1060
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,798
it's probably 60 more feet to the water

1061
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,920
to the water yes so I was a little

1062
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:20,119
nervous there cuz it was just a little

1063
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,400
bit I have to say and did I not make the

1064
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,880
offer I will take that very dangerous

1065
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,318
right there I'm always accepting of

1066
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,720
keeping Johnny be we keep it real for

1067
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,920
you guys as safe as we can keep so

1068
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,078
anyway we've done some really fun drone

1069
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,599
flying flying I'm kind of was a little

1070
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:36,680
nervous I'm not going to lie that was

1071
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:39,640
pretty was windy as [ __ ] we've shown you

1072
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:41,118
guys a couple of clips and uh I think we

1073
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:42,879
might have a few more sessions in the

1074
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,798
forest because we don't feel as quite as

1075
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,039
rushed but I figured we'd at least have

1076
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:50,119
this epic Ocean View Vancouver Island

1077
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:52,079
behind us with the rain and the sun uh

1078
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,680
sun shining through the clouds I think

1079
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,960
it's perfect time for us to sit right

1080
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,679
here Johnny B pull out the six-star West

1081
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,838
Coast concentr

1082
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:01,960
pull out some Blue River tpin I'm

1083
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,119
thinking I'm just thinking you know what

1084
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,880
um the TPS look at that I got a whole

1085
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,880
bottle of OG

1086
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:16,558
Kush really yeah oh here let me sh let

1087
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,200
me try this just for super random but

1088
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:23,480
let's hit

1089
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:23,480
that okay I'm on let's hit

1090
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,079
that I like the 10-second heating up the

1091
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,200
nail that's just a new like awesome

1092
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:35,559
awesome awesome thing for us did you see

1093
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,639
that di did you did you see that that

1094
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,559
was like cuz when you go into a bottle

1095
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:41,039
was a DI TPS like that it's more than

1096
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,960
one dip and you're going to realize that

1097
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,440
so when you get your TPS some people

1098
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,838
they go through them really bad and they

1099
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,720
cuz you follow our lead and you dip in

1100
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,719
there I would actually use the dropper

1101
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:51,239
put a drip in and drop it onto your

1102
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:53,358
product I've been doing that lately have

1103
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:55,318
you even to like a couple of grams like

1104
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,880
just a single drop I whip it all around

1105
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:58,558
I add a little rosin to the bub Buble

1106
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,559
hash and then the TPS and it it's quite

1107
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,240
a lovely product see the the thing is is

1108
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,519
is the turps they're essential that you

1109
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,318
use them properly because they will last

1110
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,639
and I I hear some discouragement like oh

1111
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,798
yeah I like dipped in there like four

1112
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:13,558
times was all gone yeah when you soak

1113
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:16,599
your rosin into turpins it's more than

1114
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:19,440
one dip oh yeah it's like a soak you can

1115
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,039
count it one drop two drop three drop

1116
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,480
you know you got no drops

1117
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,599
left got to hit this one a little extra

1118
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:29,079

it's all it takes a little bit of

1138
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:12,440
capping a lot of people don't understand

1139
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:13,798
the carb cap and why a carb cap cuz if

1140
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,599
you don't you're just not really going

1141
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:18,199
to get anywhere that extra little leeway

1142
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,880
giving us like puffing on a bowl you

1143
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:21,639
give a little hand tap to keep the bowl

1144
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,200

days where every kind of three or 4

1156

1159
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,719
in the Drone little STS while you're

called a turp water board

1167
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,798

1168
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:23,719

for that what was that a the TP water

1170
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:28,000
that was TP water

1171
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,400
boarding it's like you can actually see

1172
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
that this house used to be really nice

1173
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,119

rocks down by the water if we walk a

1205
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:31,199
little bit more to the left which is

1206
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
where I usually go where those people

1207
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:36,239
are right there that's also a nice

1208
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,679
little spot you saw it fly with a drone

1209
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:41,439
they did yep I could have taken them

1210
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:42,919
down even closer I like that for sure

1211
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,599
it's great that you guys get us out on

1212
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,240
these puff Wednesdays we missed a couple

1213
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:47,920
there when the camera was broken but we

1214
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:49,719
got it happening now we got the dual

1215
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,440
cameras with time lapses we got the

1216
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:53,919
Drone footage I'll take some macro

1217
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,400
videos and photos throw them into this

1218
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,960
video and puff Wednesday should be a

1219
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,160
substantial Improvement mement from the

1220
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,599
regular videos that I post on my channel

1221
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,558
you know what I just think that every

1222
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:04,318
video you post on your channel has

1223
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,400
substantially a little bit more than the

1224
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,838
last one well it's a learning experience

1225
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,838
and I'm definitely by no means a

1226
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:14,000
professional I'm uh I'm I just came at

1227
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:15,759
this as a total Amur we have fun we have

1228
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,400
fun and as long as there's bows to be

1229
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,440
puffed oh let me clean that for you

1230
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:23,798
buddy you know what I was busy talking

1231
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,440
no it's such a low temp DB that's I'm

1232
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:27,559
say like I'm really learning because me

1233
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,440
myself I've ruined all my my quartz

1234
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:31,039
Bowls because I'm always hitting it

1235
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,960
because for me I'm always hitting it

1236
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,280
hard and hot I think it's still a good

1237
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,079
idea every once in a while to go in and

1238
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,400
just give it that that cleanup thatan

1239
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,680
which is what I'll do right now just the

1240
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,400
cleanup RIP just from those little bits

1241
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:44,679
that are smoking each time you know you

1242
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,160
don't quite see the little bit of

1243
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:48,519
residue that's on the side but it's not

1244
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:50,279
enough that it's going to oxidize the

1245
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:51,719
nail up all bad but it's definitely the

1246
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,880
beginning that if you don't clean it up

1247
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:57,038
and burn it off it's done it ends up

1248
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,280
being done like mine

1249
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:02,520
but you can always buy another one too

1250
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,839
they're pretty nonexpensive well it

1251
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,480
depends on the company you go with I

1252
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,440
think they're a couple hundred or 150

1253
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:11,358
for a quave banger I got a quave these

1254
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,280
are the DC glass I think he's around 100

1255
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:15,838
150 as well I got that PUK and be quartz

1256
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,680
the quartz one in the beginning PUK and

1257
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,759
Beagle were awesome I think we paid 300

1258
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:22,480
for those I that one got disintegrated

1259
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,720
after hitting it with heavy torches oh

1260
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,318
no that was Sapphire Sapphire Sapphire

1261
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,078
Sapphire yeah I remember you said saying

1262
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:30,038
that happened to you I had the one where

1263
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,240
they put the Dil on the bottom and

1264
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:33,839
somehow I

1265
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:37,719
uh I did a inin yeah that's nice and

1266
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:40,119
clean the wind it's just it's such a

1267
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:42,000
it's warm it's it's kind of trippy cuz

1268
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,960
it wasn't like that at all today over

1269
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,960
there anywhere we've been but when we

1270
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,119
came around here I first felt it on that

1271
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,639
down lower spot and it was it was very

1272
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,559
light but when I got up to here and

1273
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:53,838
walked through here right as you were

1274
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:55,039
saying oh my God it's so warm I don't

1275
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,558
know if it's this rock that's been

1276
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:00,280
baking in the sun all day or what it is

1277
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:02,000
feels good it's definitely a warm and

1278
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,880
the wind's hitting that rock and it's

1279
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,400
warming up the wind and it's blowing

1280
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,960

1465
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,119
too because we are literally on the

1466
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:02,480
trail head right on the trail head the

1467
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,519
main trail head that takes you in and

1468
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,639
out of this park I saw dozens of

1469
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:09,639
vehicles when I went in we bumped into

1470
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,838
probably 15 plus people and for whatever

1471
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:14,199
reason there's nobody around right now

1472
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,199
which is

1473
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:18,359
