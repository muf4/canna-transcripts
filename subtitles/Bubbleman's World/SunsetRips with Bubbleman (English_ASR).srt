hey welcome to Bubble man's world uh

3
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,879
just figured I'd come smoke a bowl with

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,159
some of my online YouTube followers uh

5
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,759
also the Instagram and Facebook people

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,199
always uh happy to answer your questions

7
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,839
I see a lot of questions coming in all

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,120
the time so I'm trying to answer them

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
and uh get videos done in regards to

10
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,119
particular questions that you guys asked

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,320
but uh today today's video is just about

12
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,399
enjoying a beautiful sunset so I figured

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,238
we'd load up the

14
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,840
mothership many of you probably

15
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:58,799

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,960
few pictures of this particular pipe

17
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,919

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,320
background today instead of taking a
