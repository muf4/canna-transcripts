it looks like snow but it's actually a

10
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:41,519
salt mine so that worked for that and

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,079
this was actually done in Amsterdam when

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,629
the canals froze over

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,189

Carolyn - excellent which is a drop th

21
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,489
seeds not bombs so if we were just to

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,560
drop seeds instead of bombs the world

23
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,688
would be a better place especially if

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
their MKULTRA seems very true yes

25
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,709
excellent so one beam in each package

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960

George in jail because if he was alive

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,939
today he would be for the amount of hemp

32
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,789
he grew he would be behind bars for life

33
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,398
he'd be next to mark yeah it would be

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,530
