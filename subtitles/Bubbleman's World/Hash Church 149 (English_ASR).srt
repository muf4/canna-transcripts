everybody was out taking care of their

54
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:22,900
topiaries and there's beautiful

55
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,718
topiaries all over the place I mean it's

56
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,239
it's it's wonderful to watch and be part

57
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:31,269
of I have to admit well I saw that it

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,849
was you finished off the states that was

59
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:36,250
it for you wasn't it yep I did all 50

60
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:37,840
states and when I got to Alaska when I

61
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,639
was since I was on hash Church the

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,098
wonderful people over at rainforest

63
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,560
guard rainforest farms and Juno Alaska

64
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:46,149
invited me over to their garden so the

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,000
literally got into Alaska and went

66
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,799
straight to a garden and then I get home

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,628
and I opened up this cannabis Business

68
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:56,169
Times which is in a magazine here in the

69
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:57,489
states and there's the grow I was at in

70
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,879
Juneau Alaska

71
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,200
that's so trippy yeah so they're all

72
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,468
grown and LEDs up there

73
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,968
this is fluence lights add but I want to

74
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:09,009
thank Gianna Barrett and the wonderful

75
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:11,500
people that were in forests farms they

76
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:13,239
were awesome it was fascinating what's

77
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,650
going on up in Alaska compared to what's

78
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,239
going on stateside because I've been

79
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,479
able to go through other states and see

80
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,310
what's transpiring and sure Alaska is

81
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,620
very much like the early part of

82
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,438
California everybody is bootstrap no one

83
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,569
can get any kind of money to do whatever

84
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:31,918
they need to do so everybody has to

85
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:34,060
strap from the bottom on up so right

86
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,459
everyone seems to be grown with LEDs

87
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,650
some people are just growing and selling

88
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,348
what they grow where others buy from

89
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:46,030
distributors so it was interesting to

90
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:47,888
see how frustrating is check this out if

91
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,150
they need to send in a sample because

92
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,579
they have to have everything tested to

93
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,769
show exactly you know their THC CBD all

94
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,509
those CBD is illegal in Alaska to the

95
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:01,030
dispensaries but they're selling it in

96
00:03:55,508 --> 00:04:04,688
health food stores yeah so the marijuana

97
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,938
there is it's it's very good it's not

98
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:09,459
the quality that I expect yet of

99
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:12,128
California etc that I'm used to but

100
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,680
they're very popular with edibles there

101
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:19,298
because everybody comes in on a cruise

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,759
ships so yeah so edibles are really high

103
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:23,469
they don't have a lot of if

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,259
I didn't really see any distillates

105
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,790
rainforest Farms is working on that but

106
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,699
for the most part it's mostly just

107
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,310
flowers and edibles not a lot of other

108
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:36,699
ancillary products but it costs seven

109
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,930
hundred dollars to fly to the laboratory

110
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,879
get a sample so it doesn't matter if you

111
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,209
get one sample or fifty it cost you

112
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,909
seven hundred dollars to get it there

113
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:49,120
he's forget about the testing price it's

114
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,350
the helicopter cost yeah you'd think

115
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,840
it'd be cheaper to send it by dogsled

116
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,470
but unfortunately there's only a handful

117
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,299
of testers in the state of Alaska so you

118
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,520
know they're reliant on that reality

119
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,660
currently so it was beautiful to see

120
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,449
everywhere we went

121
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,780
everybody was selling cannabis so every

122
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:10,389
city we stopped in Skagway Juneau and

123
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:13,689
Ketchikan there were multiple retail

124
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,000
dispensaries for 21 and older so it was

125
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:19,149
fascinating to get an eye on the scene

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,730
outside of the lower 48 I mean I'm gonna

127
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:23,139
see what happens in a Hawaii in December

128
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,140
because they finally opened things up

129
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:27,879
but yeah outside of the lower 48 that's

130
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,269
always been pretty much aware of so it

131
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,569
was fascinating well cool beans did you

132
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:37,209
get your mic unmuted there John no you

133
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:39,370
did not know you have to reset your

134
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:41,799
whole computer most likely that's

135
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,259
usually what happens you can kind of try

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,720
to reset the browser but you might have

137
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:52,959
to Johnny B what a character in Anna I

138
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,210
got to spend the last 7 or 8 days with

139
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,810
Johnny B on a little trip to Jamaica we

140
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:01,229

141
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,269

142
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,980

165
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,870
the art gets I had to go in and

166
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,989
immediately put booties on top of my

167
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:18,269
shoes and everything about the place was

168
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:19,889
state-of-the-art top-of-the-line I have

169
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,799
been waiting to see something like that

170
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,560
so I was beyond proud to see you know

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,910
hospital-grade floors and walls and

172
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,040
things like that which is the reality

173
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,720
that is needed you know to take things

174
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,610
to the next level so I was very

175
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,630
impressed by what they've been able to

176
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,330
bring forward yeah well I mean the way I

177
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,279
say it is Tony's no slouch it's it's

178
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:43,199
been this has been five plus years in

179
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,109
the making since really we met in

180
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,209
Amsterdam and with the you know with the

181
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,460
the evolution and the innovation of

182
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:53,729
prana with the creation of blue river

183
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,469
terpenes and finally the birth of you

184
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,020
know the the bubble man brand actually

185
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,720
getting launched it's been it's been

186
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,759
very symbiotic with those three brands

187
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,260
that's for sure it's been exciting tell

188
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,509
you from my perspective sitting up here

189
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,060
in Canada being a part of it through

190
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,189
Skype and video chats but still not

191
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,160
being there you know it's incredible

192
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,170
it was interesting too it's one thing to

193
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,360
hear something and you know to think

194
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,129
about okay this is the possibility it's

195
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,660
another thing to actually walk into that

196
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:27,329
reality so it was good to see the future

197
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,800
right you know because I hear people say

198
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,300
it all the time and you know I hear

199
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,399
people say you know the most common

200
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,289
thing I ever hear is you know ermahgerd

201
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,959
this is a best part your ever great you

202
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,789
know and you know I wish I could every

203
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,470
time you know you've heard that bubble

204
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,819
Manion you know once you hear that from

205
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,590
somebody what you're going to see is

206
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,400
definitely not even close to the best

207
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,399
but you're going to

208
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,889
it's true it's it's true you know it was

209
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:55,980
you know there's a kind of a difference

210
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:58,769
to in regards to commercial production

211
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,050
of resin and producing something on this

212
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:03,240
level that is because it's going to be

213
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:05,099
sold to so many different people that

214
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,688
you know you need to really raise the

215
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,069
bar to protect everyone that you're

216
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:10,110
selling to to make sure that you're

217
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:12,958
selling everything that's on par no

218
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,579
molds no microbials etc testing for

219
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,948
pesticides much like you guys have been

220
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:18,088
doing for so long but then you know

221
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:20,219
there's the other side of the coin

222
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,589
where's where I started and recently

223
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,119
being in Ontario for this little couple

224
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,670
of days of hash making I made some

225
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:29,339
beautiful hash a little bit just sitting

226
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:32,818
on the top of the jar they're really

227
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,619
really nice quality five star I guess I

228
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:37,169
would call it not quite six but five

229
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:39,509
star for sure and I didn't make it in a

230
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:41,578
lab I made it in a garage with concrete

231
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,220
floors and with tools hanging everywhere

232
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:46,138
and with so there's kind of oh I wanted

233
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,709
to welcome some cool to the room as I'm

234
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:51,329
telling this story welcomes up just

235
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,768
telling you're doing everyone's got the

236
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:53,758
blue microphone I [ __ ] love it you

237
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,308
know I'm just talking about the

238
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,379
difference right now sup between Tony's

239
00:09:56,308 --> 00:10:00,419
lab the invasive lab which is probably

240
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,119
what I would call the most cutting-edge

241
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:06,058
hashish laboratory going right now at

242
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:07,619
least in North America but on the flip

243
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:09,389
side of that is the beautiful thing

244
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:11,100
about bubble hash and the ability to

245
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:12,298
make your own bubble hash is that you

246
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,909
can do it in your own kitchen

247
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:17,159
it doesn't require a lab you can you can

248
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:20,399
even bust out the most beautiful damn

249
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,438
near Pharma ratio quality pharma purity

250
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,470
99.9 percent if not a hundred percent

251
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:27,088
hence and I did it recently in an area

252
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,980
that you know most people would be like

253
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,139
oh my god you can't you can't make

254
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,028
bubble next to that or you can't do this

255
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,318
and that but you know it's part of the

256
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:36,208
thing that we have to remember about

257
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:38,639
bubble hash is that you don't require a

258
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,409
laboratory to make it for yourself but

259
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,289
you can make it in your kitchen with a

260
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:45,808
little spoon and a little bucket and

261
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:48,448
it's the quality is really on par and I

262
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:51,659
would say that it's it's kind of one of

263
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:53,219
the bonuses of a bubble hash one thing

264
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,048
you know you've we've known each other a

265
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,240
long time mark and I will tell everybody

266
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,720
that's why I mean I'm not some pro hash

267
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,180
mate

268
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,060
I've never made tons of amounts I've

269
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:05,399
never sold hash but but with your bubble

270
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,500
bags I was able with a steel spoon in my

271
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,059
kitchen and some ice to make killer

272
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,980
product I mean you can see my product

273
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,739
all over the net I never made more than

274
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,120
a gram or two for you guys watching me

275
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,980
and bubble man had this kind of thing

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,078
I used to press my little teeny pieces

277
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,399
ash and I do now know that I was

278
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,750
pressuring water in it by the way I'm

279
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,250
telling you publicly I was pressed a

280
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,528
little bit of water in it but the putts

281
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,509
were so small it wasn't an issue and and

282
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:29,938
water man was pressing a lot more ash

283
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,318
and so he used to spread it out more and

284
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:33,088
that's kind of how our conversation

285
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:35,849
started he's like hey sub I see ash you

286
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,740
should spread it out stuff like that so

287
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,540
yeah it's kind of cool well you forgot

288
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,009
to mention that with bubble bags a

289
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,588

290
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:49,318

313
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:37,170
boon that voodoo that you do so well you

314
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,429
know when I suppose making hash I wasn't

315
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:40,378
doing it properly and of course that's

316
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:42,419
one of that you mark and you show me the

317
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,610
sifting and then instantly started

318
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,578
sieving and putting my hash through a

319
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,350
colander and not making pucks and well

320
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:52,500
hope you in saw her in a unique

321
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:56,370
situation both you and sub had great

322
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,649
material but work you know just needed a

323
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,789
few little tips and so the problem is

324
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:02,250
out there is when people are using

325
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:04,889
shitty material and you give them tips

326
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,688
and those tips don't really result in

327
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,399
them producing a product that is

328
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:10,198
exciting and something that they

329
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,929
actually want to you know show off and

330
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:13,729
share with people so

331
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:16,579
the real bonus in all of this is

332
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:19,039
actually having material to use that is

333
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,220
worthwhile using if you're cleaning up

334
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,709
schwag it's just it's just not going to

335
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,930
clean up the way you want it to best

336
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,028
flowers best material makes the best

337
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:32,929
hash period people you can't polish a

338
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:35,000
turd baby Michael exactly I think I said

339
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:37,278
that just the other day I'm not even

340
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,899
joking I literally said to someone you

341
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,399
cannot polish a turd now people are

342
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:42,440
trying to polish turds they've got their

343
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,269
turd polishing kits out bro they buy

344
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,330
those kits on Walmart they're selling

345
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:51,458
those turd polisher kids man you can add

346
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,459
stuff to make your turd smell better

347
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,560
which is a problem that's something that

348
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,019
we've seen all the way back from when

349
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,719
people would put in orange peels you

350
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,370
know to change the sentiment or you know

351
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,810
thinking they're doing good you know but

352
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,580
not realizing the damage they're

353
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:10,009
actually doing or creating spores

354
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,720
available like I said I'll never forget

355
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,278
seeing my buddy walking up to my

356
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,470
friend's apartment seeing these buds

357
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,778
hanging and I was like I was like what

358
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,420
the [ __ ] is all over them they look so

359
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:27,830
weird he's like oh I sprayed them with

360
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:30,349
Orange Crush I was like what he sprayed

361
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:32,570
his colas with Orange Crush apparently

362
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,139
it dries in is very sticky and looks

363
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,670
very good I just I left I left the room

364
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:41,778
I left the house I left that

365
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:43,789
relationship I left I left I left I know

366
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:45,860
people back in the days it was the old

367
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:48,588
coca-cola trick you know sprayed down

368
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,360
with coca-cola the last couple days

369
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,529
before you harvest they they dry up and

370
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,778
look like a crystals ought to be

371
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:56,689
stickier than hell and indeed look at

372
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:58,639
the we use sticks to the wall and hey

373
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,860
that was the late 80s Early 90s that I

374
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,809
recall well they still do it that way

375
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,409
when I was originally buying and selling

376
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:08,119
weed the Mexican that I got was all

377
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:10,549
compressed with coca-cola so it was

378
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,950
brown and if you actually would break

379
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:15,649
open that quarter pound you'd see the

380
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:18,350
sugar stains on the inside I mean it was

381
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,690
absolutely dumbfounded but that's that's

382
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,730
how it is it was the exact way that grow

383
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,230
crystals background that's not the

384
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,970
easiest way to grow

385
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,009
I know it's not I don't think absolutely

386
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,740
people they doing I would like to

387

404
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:19,429
awesome Sara hope I could only see your

405
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:21,409
avatar I hadn't opened up your camera

406
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:23,359
but when you spoke it went fullscreen

407
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,289
and I was like holy smokes that is

408
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,190
awesome

409
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:29,839
I mean just pathetic things like staged

410
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,780
in the back behind you in a big massive

411
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,200
concert just pounding and I could do it

412
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,539
I got I fifty acres no no no the best

413
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,910
listen the best part about that busy the

414
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,939
best part of that property is that

415
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:47,179
there's nobody on it that's the best

416
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:51,460
part of that property I could us down

417
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:54,679
you I would never have a party here

418
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,840
security risk ever you know growers

419
00:16:54,679 --> 00:17:05,179
right you don't ever let anybody come to

420
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:06,949
your place like I would never sleep

421
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,900
again that's what I'm saying I know you

422
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,759
very well and the idea if you have a big

423
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,180
stage and a party at your property I

424
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,949
could just imagine you can just be rude

425
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,140
yeah I wouldn't be working for me I can

426
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:20,750
do as big as I have to have it now and

427
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,850
no bigger that's like the length of feet

428
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,160
my stress level would be too high that's

429
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,179
for sure good right well thank you for

430
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,060
coming in in such a beautiful

431
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,340
environment how about yourself Natasha

432
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,869

436
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:44,689
yeah we had a nice evening out in

437
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,570
Vancouver last night went to check out

438
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,490
the fireworks show with Kristin and

439
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:51,919
Tyler and see I was nice they have a

440
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,109
nice patio from their apartment and kits

441
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,060
so we didn't have to get up in all the

442
00:17:54,109 --> 00:18:01,969
crowds or anything could watch from afar

443
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:05,000
I preferred a fireworks yeah and they

444
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,890
put on a good show it was just a nice

445
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,779
night nice to go out I've been kind of

446
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,790
her buddy writing and staying in my

447
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:13,670
apartment lately so it was nice to check

448
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:15,500
out the city and yeah but the end and a

449
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,900
fireworks display last night wasn't that

450
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,319
amazing like I was right on the beach in

451
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,940
Kitts and it was just I mean the lights

452
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,500
the sky just lit right up and for

453
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,080
Vancouver to be so beautiful I was

454
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,000
staring right at the barge and wow it

455
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,189
was a it was really good to see them on

456
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,500
August 2nd on August 3rd I think too but

457
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,690
I didn't see it on there with all the

458
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,519
hundred thousand people down that yeah

459
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,019
it's totally a different experience when

460
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,539
you're up on the beach right under the

461
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,460
fireworks which I've also experienced as

462
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,720
I I did that a few years ago in

463
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Vancouver and lightning and

464
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,559
thunderstorms are very rare here and

465
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,450
there happened to be this epic lightning

466
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,450
storm going on while the fireworks were

467
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,590
going on so that was very very cool but

468
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,019
that's awesome

469
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:58,970
okay the next show also being out on the

470
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:00,650
boat is always one of my favorites

471
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,680
getting out on the boat and being like

472
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,360
almost next to the barge is a really

473
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,570
really beautiful spot to see those

474
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,969
fireworks from yes I don't have that

475
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:13,159
experience yet so have to do that for

476
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,750
the next firework show yeah I could

477
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,330
probably maybe drive the boat out to

478
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,650
kiss drop it in the water there and then

479
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:20,389
we could go out on the boat and watch

480
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,030
that way I don't have to drive my boat

481
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,400
three hours from where I live all the

482
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:27,289
way around the mountain to get to which

483
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,410
is scary trying to get home took about

484
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,639
three plus hours in the pitch-black

485
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,890
driving like two kilometers an hour

486
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,270
looking for logs and other things in the

487
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,270

have Sarah give us the lowdown on what's

500
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,220
going on with the karma Cup this year I

501
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:17,778
have a great time at the karmic up lots

502
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,210
of people asked me you know all there's

503
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:22,788
so many different events you know what

504
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,069
for me I'll give you my perspective not

505
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:28,788
as a person who's going to the event to

506
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:31,038
see the booths - to see the band's to

507
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:33,558
see the talks cuz I don't go for any of

508
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:36,288
that I'm a businessman I go to expose my

509
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,569
company to people and I can say this

510
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:40,700
that out of all the shows I do I do

511
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,950
really well at the karmic up not just

512
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,749
for business but for interactions with

513
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,269
people who have come from all over

514
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:50,058
Ontario Canada in the u.s. to actually

515
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:52,519
come see me or to see John or to see

516
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:54,798
whoever else is at this event and so I

517
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:57,558
really feel that the Karma cup is they

518
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,720
set a success for that reason a lot of

519
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:02,298
the larger bigger sort of conferences

520
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,548
that are I guess a little bit more you

521
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:06,319
know less smoking and more conference I

522
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:08,148
don't really do very well at those

523
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,220
conferences I don't really do a much

524
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:13,308
business but at the karmic up its

525
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,929
business like crazy so from a business

526
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:16,970
perspective which is I think my most

527
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:19,129
accurate perspective that I can give you

528
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,629
it's a great event it's worth having a

529
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:22,488
booth and it's worth going down there

530
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:23,778
and getting some exposure so what do you

531
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:27,858
say Sarah you want to tell us a little

532
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:32,210
bit about this year's Cup yes totally

533
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:37,069
mark so its first office September 9th

534
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:38,749
and 10th in Toronto two days on over the

535
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:41,118
weekend it's the weekend after Labor Day

536
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:46,848
oh yeah my joint was just delivers for

537
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:48,378
me I'm so happy I was waiting for that I

538
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:55,788
had to send attacks I'm like he's

539
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:58,488
definitely my joint Josh is the mass yes

540
00:21:55,788 --> 00:22:01,729
he is he's awesome okay

541
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:03,319
so September 9th and 10th in Toronto

542
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:06,319
it's

543
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:08,750
an expo we've got speakers it's a

544
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:12,349
competition like for instance right now

545
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,240
but just the other day we had these

546
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:15,980
in-person entry date and got all the

547
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,890
entries and it looks like there's going

548
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,009
to be over a hundred again this year I

549
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:25,580
could still use more bud and

550
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:27,339
concentrates though so if you have bud

551
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,379
or concentrates and you want to enter

552
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:32,929
hit me up and I'll give you another week

553
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,990
so that's like two hundred grams approx

554
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,549
a bud and 32 grams of concentrate we'll

555
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,420
deal with the details if you want to hit

556
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:44,359
me up Sarah at the Karma Capcom or like

557
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:47,150
on any of the socials basically I'll

558
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,089
read your DM and we can figure it out

559
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:53,060
I've got the most ridiculous quantity of

560
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:55,849
edibles this year if people are just

561
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:57,379
going crazy it's pretty cool to see the

562
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:59,809
mature marketplace that we've developed

563
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,730
and how many new companies are out there

564
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:05,710
and how many people are excited about

565
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:08,539
the industry and trying to innovate and

566
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,789
bring good products to the public so I'm

567
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:13,399
super excited I really hope that in our

568
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,779
new legalization framework that we that

569
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,810
all these new companies really get a

570
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:19,279
chance to to show what their to

571
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:21,859
demonstrate their knowledge that they've

572
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,529
acquired over years of experience in the

573
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:29,329
industry it would really be a shame if

574
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:33,139
all this industry knowledge is not taken

575
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:33,799
advantage of so yeah I'm almost sold out

576

577

I've got like zero small booths and I've

578
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,059
got like maybe under five big booths

579
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,920
left so if you want a booth like I would

580
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:46,210
get on it Monday or Tuesday because I

581
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,980
would expect them to be done by Thursday

582
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:53,600

583

650
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,029
then we were like all right let's go

651
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,710
back to we'll go to Toronto together but

652
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,190
I was staying in Toronto to make some

653
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,809
hash John was going to continue on to

654
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,580
Vancouver and they made him miss his

655
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,200
flight like [ __ ] I was stoked though

656
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:05,149
dude we got to puff a nice little

657
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,039
session that night it was kind of nice

658
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,410
you know and then and then because of

659
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,569
the screw-up and the whole thing and yes

660
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,029
it was a Jerry Springer at the airport

661
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:16,849
in Kingston Jamaica there was people

662
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:18,559
arrested people were puking I put on my

663
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:20,149
Facebook we people were rioting it was

664
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,829
it was pretty intense

665
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:26,090
then I showed everybody on the plane the

666
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:27,799
next day I'm like yeah nice day we all

667
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:30,379
made it home nicely and things went

668
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,299
fantastic Jamaica was amazing

669
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,770
lots of talk about I think we need pony

670
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:35,750
to be on here to talk more about what's

671
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:37,220
going on in Jamaica and for the world

672
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,589
because it's a pretty good stuff going

673
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,440
on for them yeah I'm sure he'll be on a

674
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:42,889
little later on today he's been to run

675
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,840
around

676
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,700
he's been touring around some people and

677
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:49,490
pretty busy in the last couple of days I

678
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,490
know yesterday I watched him on Google

679
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,640
Chat filling up the first bubble man pen

680
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:58,940
with I think it was strawberry banana

681
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,160
goo as well as the 30% terpenes in there

682
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,500
and I guess we'll hear a little bit

683
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,509
about that he was going to Andrew D

684
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,819
Angelo's birthday party last night to

685
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:09,379
hit everyone up with the with the new

686
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:12,409
pan I'll tell you one thing when he hit

687
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,570
that pan on the camera he literally blew

688
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,150
right out of the scene he was sideways

689
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:20,000
he hit it like this and then he coughed

690
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,620
and blew backwards out of the camera

691
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,470
view it was quite funny I guess the pen

692
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:26,389
has been designed to really rip like a

693
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,880
nail we don't want these little puffy

694
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,440
like you know but also designed to give

695
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,640
a standardized dose and that was the

696
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,559
biggest thing that we were talking about

697
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,180
I liked how it was talking about on the

698
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,279
dose every time

699
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,310
yeah well the standard eye dose is

700
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,230
actually the the other unit that he was

701
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:43,119
talking about with the Teflon mesh not

702
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,720
our pen

703
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,669

704
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,890
different unit but also very cool

Boy and Astro Boy was done as an

793
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:44,859
accident I guess bad boy was taking care

794
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,028
of the grow for some while he was

795
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:48,788
potentially I think he might have been

796
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:50,440
in jail at the time and bad boy didn't

797
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:53,079
realize this male and I can't remember

798
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,259
if it was an Apollo 13 or an Ortega or

799
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:58,658

he was really kind of a little bit upset

813
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:27,079
you know I respect what he was upset

814
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,960
about but it was less than three months

815
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:32,869
later that that tune changed and he's

816
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,710
just been praising the astroboy ever

817
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:39,079
since oh yeah good plan I enjoy it

818
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,610
heavily so thank you guys for sharing

819
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:42,679
genetics and you know it's very

820
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:44,659
important to share genetics because I

821
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,420
recently had an incident where I came

822
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,340
back from a trip and a couple of my

823
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,740
mothers have like died because somebody

824
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:53,809
hadn't actually gotten them water and I

825
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,430
was like all super bummed out and when

826
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:58,220
it was one of my favorite plant and I

827
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:01,250
I'd given it away so I'm able to get it

828
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:04,190
back well isn't that the way to do it

829
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:06,369
right yeah when you share the genetics I

830
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,720
saw someone post recently this beautiful

831
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:11,690
spear it was probably like a two and a

832
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,379
half foot long just spear a beautiful

833
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:17,750
purple bud greenish purple bud covered

834
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,789
in resin like white and the guy was all

835
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,760
happy because he had given it away a

836
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:24,259
bunch of times and he was able to get it

837
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,820
back because he was giving it away it's

838
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,590
a pretty simple thing people if you

839
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,960
don't understand it if you hoard

840
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,390
something and then you kill it

841
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,849
it will be gone and you will be the

842
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:37,819
person to blame sorry to tell you it's

843
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:41,509
hardware stores yes that you were giving

844
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,460
away free seeds did you know I patented

845
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,290
that so if you give away free seed you

846
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,418
actually have to baby well listen to

847
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:50,329
this Sam not not only did I know that

848
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:55,039
the free seeds I'm giving away are yours

849
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:57,739
oh [ __ ] [ __ ] I know you've got a

850
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:01,369
patent it I know you've got it patented

851
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:04,129
oh my god caring that's what you always

852
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:05,839
said mark sharing is caring that's when

853
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,610
I share information or knowledge and

854
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,980
what we do here every weekend we share

855
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,960
that's it and it's inferred for the

856
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,000
level that we're at I'm not tell talking

857
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,460
about skunkman Sam go take his forty

858
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,550
years of work of his registered cultivar

859
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,349
and go you know peel it off and she

860
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,240
with the entire world I understand both

861
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:24,769
sides when there's a business when

862
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,899
you've invested millions of dollars and

863
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:28,369
you've paid PhDs to do work for you and

864
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,250
you have laboratories and greenhouses

865
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:33,500
and all of these things well okay now

866
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,860
we're entering a different world and yes

867
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,840
of course that person those people who

868
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,970
have done that work should be paid for

869
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:44,030
their work they should get something out

870
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:45,589
of that so I see both sides I'm just

871
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:49,340
talking about cultivars that are all on

872
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:54,980
the all on this level of being able to

873
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:57,320
if you can buy it well I can share it if

874
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,840
I can get it I can have no problem with

875
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,950
giving away three seeds I strongly

876
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,630
believe in it

877
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:08,659
oh I'm sure you've probably given away

878
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:11,390
more seeds than than anyone I know I can

879
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:14,839
only imagine the kilos and kilos and

880
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:17,299
kilos of seeds that have left your hands

881
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,010
to go to other people you've even taken

882
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,600
it upon yourself to collect other seeds

883
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,520
I'll never forget being at Sam's house

884
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,409
and he started pulling these giant

885
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:27,590
[ __ ] seeds out literally like this

886
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:28,909
big remember he had one on his couch one

887
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,610
time and people thought it was one of

888
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:35,359
those pillows you sit on when you have

889
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:37,309
Coco de Mer seed that in the world cocoa

890
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,559
damaris it's an unbelievable thing to

891
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:40,789
get that put in your hand like here

892
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,099
check this out and I'm like what you've

893
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:44,779
shipped one of these back from the

894
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:47,659
station or wherever you were and he's

895
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:55,269
like no I shipped a trunkload of them

896
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:58,219
back I just appreciate Sam I really do

897
00:36:55,269 --> 00:37:00,259
we think bag loads are is just a stash

898
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:02,629
loads he thinks trunk loads and that's

899
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,970
beautiful well keep in mind a trunk load

900
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:09,309
of these seeds was probably twelve I

901
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:12,709
don't know I I their huge [ __ ] seeds

902
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:15,980
if they fall on you they can kill you oh

903
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:18,829
I bet how much does what is it weigh

904
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:21,559
like a kilo or something no no it's more

905
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:23,750
like forty kilos holy like when it's

906
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,000
full of water and fresh when it's full

907
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:29,210
of water and it still hasn't husk on it

908
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,400
because what you saw was Dee husk just

909
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:38,059
like the coconut is das Jesus

910
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,300
that's just incredible incredible

911
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:43,400
so I guess Natasha are we gonna have

912
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:47,510

00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:31,579
they're announcing that tragically camp

951
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:34,069
is going to be one did you see that hi

952
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:39,409
times is also preparing to go public on

953
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:42,230
the stock market yeah that's because

954
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:44,269
that's coming down the pike if people

955
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,679
don't know hi Times was recently sold to

956
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:47,480
a new group

957
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,179
with a whole bunch of different people

958
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,420
and a lot of people that I know that are

959
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,618
good people so hopefully they'll change

960
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,750
some of the direction of the magazine

961
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:57,890
the cups of really going in their own

962
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,710
direction

963
00:39:57,889 --> 00:40:02,420
but yeah apparently they're putting

964
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,309
together to make a public offering and

965
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,068
it'll be available on the stock market I

966
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:08,990
don't know what the actual calling

967
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:11,568
letters are but I thought that was an

968
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:13,278
interesting move considering the you

969
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:14,989
know legality and how things are

970
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,539
becoming more normalized I don't know if

971
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:20,449
you guys saw but Sunset magazine which

972
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:22,700
is a very normal magazine for your

973
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:25,879
predominant home person or garden person

974
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:27,409
came out with an article on how to grow

975
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,108
marijuana I mean how to grow your

976
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:32,629
cannabis outdoor because it's now legal

977
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:34,788
on the entire you know the west coast

978
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,940
now people can grow their own in certain

979
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:40,039
states so the normal magazines are

980
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,750
starting to go okay well now we can talk

981
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:44,539
about this because this is now part of

982
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,608
you know adult life over 21 that you

983
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,289
know you need to know how to grow yes

984
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:50,719
sunset it really blew my mind because

985
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:54,950
I've been to their actual they have

986
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:57,230
festivals over here in San Jose and I've

987
00:40:54,949 --> 00:41:00,139
been it's very you know it's it's all

988
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:02,480
the the regular people who sell all the

989
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:04,608
things for your home sponsor it I'm

990
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,789
talking everything from solar panels to

991
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:08,808
the nails to the screws to the hammers

992
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:12,020
electronic cameras all that sort of

993
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:15,920
stuff so it's fascinating to see the

994
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:17,659
normalcy spreading into the media in a

995
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,548
way that we have never had exposure

996
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:21,528
where High Times is the only way you

997
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:23,659
could get grow information back in the

998
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:25,760
day hell marc emery even had to do it

999
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:28,788
you know constitutionally up there in

1000
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,589
Canada to sell high times because you

1001
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:33,200
know your government wouldn't even allow

1002
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,578
high times for a time being you know so

1003
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,608
I think it's kudos that they're now

1004
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:39,680
gonna have a cannabis cup finally in

1005
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:45,288
Canada I think it's fitting and it shows

1006
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:47,298
to the steadfastness of the Canadian you

1007
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:48,980
know not give up and you go out from not

1008
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:50,679
even having the magazine to getting

1009
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,329
ready to have a cannabis cup so

1010
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,578
outstanding well it'll be interesting to

1011
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:58,190
see how much sort of traction they can

1012
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,410
build in three weeks I did not go to the

1013
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,568
bio couple

1014
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:04,118
dear I had my friends go and say it was

1015
00:42:01,568 --> 00:42:06,250
was fine it's a I have to pick and

1016
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:08,858
choose you know really carefully with my

1017
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:11,858
products because not all the cup events

1018
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:13,690
I go to end up being worthwhile for me

1019
00:42:11,858 --> 00:42:16,088
business-wise now when it comes to high

1020
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:18,818
times they've always been able to bring

1021
00:42:16,088 --> 00:42:22,000
people but that's with usually like

1022
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:24,338
three to six months of advance of being

1023
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,440
able to like promote and get the event

1024
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:28,269
going so I won't be going to the High

1025
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,099
Times Cannabis Cup this year but I know

1026
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:31,750
my friends will and I'm sure we'll get

1027
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,410
an update on whether or not they pulled

1028
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,960
it off

1029
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:36,279
with bringing the the people that need

1030
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,880
to come when you actually have a high

1031
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,990
times event that to me tells me that

1032
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,480
thousands of people are going to come

1033
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:45,759
for four to five thousand minimum maybe

1034
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,349
ten thousand will be more with the

1035
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,809
events that will be well we have some

1036
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:52,000
headline as we've enlisted on Monday and

1037
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,230
the new headline is coming up and High

1038
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,298
Times just taking over the events

1039
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,010
because the event was a ten year event

1040
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:59,949
so they've taken over in the next eight

1041
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,359
years so it'd definitely be a big event

1042
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:03,098
it'll happen every year for the next

1043
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:07,298
eight years at the Grizzly Adam farm

1044
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:09,309
ranch I should say and in on the island

1045
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:11,048
it's gonna be fantastic I hope everybody

1046
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:13,450
can make it out this year but it's

1047

sponsored one years ago apparently but

1057
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,289
in my opinion this is the first one that

1058
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:42,960
they're doing and it's pretty cool to

1079
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:41,000
wow

1080
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,730
descended across the border I actually

1081
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,469
got it in Alaska when I got at this

1082
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:48,230
actually at gianna shop there at

1083
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:50,268
rainforest farms and it's really cool

1084
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,789
it's a cute little illustrations and

1085
00:44:50,268 --> 00:44:56,239
they've got little scent stickers so you

1086
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:58,880
can actually scratch and sniff them and

1087
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:01,159
yeah things smell like a lot of things

1088
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,048
the cannabis still doesn't smell but

1089
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:05,480
it's got like a little mango so you can

1090
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:07,429
smell the mango and lemon and piney and

1091
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,548
it explains some of the you know Kerry

1092
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:13,038
awfully lemony little ol Mersin so it

1093
00:45:10,548 --> 00:45:15,139
breaks down terpenes for people so it's

1094
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,230
the first that I've seen of a breakdown

1095
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:21,409
that's very simplistic for people and

1096
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:24,230
then it worth I don't know I literally I

1097
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:29,838
got it at the at the shop there it's a

1098
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:34,309
it's abrams image abrams image calm and

1099
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:36,949
it's the book of weed by seth Matlin's

1100
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:41,000
and eve Epstein illustrated by Anne

1101
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:42,469
Picard does it smell like Terps yes yeah

1102
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,568
they have some you know that you can

1103
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:46,759
definitely tell like here's maple syrup

1104
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:49,460
and it's okay Oh maple syrup but there's

1105
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:51,108
their cannabis Terps in there it says so

1106
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,059
but they don't smell right that's

1107
00:45:51,108 --> 00:45:54,798
because Tony has that technology to make

1108
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:57,349
scratch and sniff cards and stickers

1109
00:45:54,798 --> 00:46:00,798
with terpenes I smelt the tangi business

1110
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:03,970
card it was unbelievable I see in the

1111
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:07,818
future a dana larson scratch and sniff

1112
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:09,528
cartoon book all with weed cultivars I'm

1113
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:12,079
gonna put that together thank you for

1114
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:14,929
showing that book it's yeah it's needed

1115
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,579
I mean if they're if there's one thing

1116
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:18,259
that's needed is it's an identifier for

1117
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:20,329
these genetics it's a bad enough we've

1118
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:22,369
got some of these funniest names for

1119
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:24,210
these things but it's one thing to know

1120
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:26,400
the name it's another thing to actually

1121
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,710
have the phenotype set in a sense so

1122
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,039
that we could actually drop and smell

1123
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:34,079
and so that people could a climatic

1124
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:36,179
eight my bud tenders I can educate then

1125
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,039
better the patients and the public

1126
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:39,960
because then they know what they have

1127
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:41,880
what they're looking for what they don't

1128
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,369
have access to we've had to learn that

1129
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,010
from you know our own organoleptic

1130
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:48,869
testing or for me I've been I've seen

1131
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,210
you know I've seen tons and tons of

1132
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:53,490
cannabis over the decades so I've been

1133
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,900
fortunate to understand and get my own

1134
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:56,669
knowledge and understanding like each

1135
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,338
and every one of us on here have for

1136
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,200
certain genetics but with the new market

1137
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:04,139
coming on there needs to be better

1138
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:07,289
education tools that we can take forward

1139
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:09,779
to the public so that they can absorb so

1140
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:11,489
that they can kind of catch up I mean we

1141
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,310
are at the tip of the spear all of us

1142
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:15,989
here okay so we're I mean some of us

1143
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:19,400
have been the tip of the Spears for you

1144
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:22,348
know four plus decades Sam you know so

1145
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,320
but it's what we need to do is another

1146
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:27,809
step is to educate the masses is we have

1147
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,519
to reach out beyond us we have to reach

1148
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:31,139
beyond the knowledge you know stop

1149
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,969
preaching to the converted get out there

1150
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:34,618
and introduce yourself to somebody and

1151
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:37,108
challenge yourself to your own

1152
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:40,260
communication abilities and communicate

1153
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:43,230
and do your best to stand steadfast to

1154
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:46,260
the challenge I would only add that I

1155
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:51,900
think to Sam might be the wind in front

1156
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:55,290
of the spear as you that's a fact it's

1157
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,019
just what I'm concerned about a little

1158
00:47:55,289 --> 00:48:02,210
bit is way some of the extract companies

1159
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:05,070
will extract THC and terpenes and then

1160
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:07,740
recombine them at the end but what the

1161
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:10,588
recombining is only five or ten terpenes

1162
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:13,108
it's not the entire suite of terpenes

1163
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:17,130
when you analyze an average plant you

1164
00:48:13,108 --> 00:48:20,989
can find 5060 terpenes pretty easy if

1165
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:24,150
you look but most people don't look

1166
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:25,618
sting sure smell like a great form of

1167
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,450
Education though for the people that

1168
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:30,210
don't have the education on just the

1169
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:31,889
terpene profiles you know about that was

1170
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,800
pretty interesting I'm pretty interested

1171
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:34,869
me

1172
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,180
well I mean doctors need this education

1173
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:38,739
I mean not only they need to know about

1174
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:40,480
this cannabis they need to know the

1175
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:42,339
different ranges and understand even

1176
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,780
about terpenes you know because some

1177
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,460
doctors do but they're mostly the

1178
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:48,100
holistic or those that are in the

1179
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,500
naturopath world they're not necessarily

1180
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,989
those of the regular doctor world no

1181
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,940
offense dr. Natasha or any other doctors

1182
00:48:52,989 --> 00:48:56,619
out there it's just it's not taught as

1183
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,780
we as you know doctor it's not taught in

1184
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:01,509
in school you've had to become your own

1185
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,730
researcher and you know find you know

1186
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:06,130
become your own arrow tip and actually

1187
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:10,440
go down that path you know and we've all

1188
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:13,059
had to become not only leaders but

1189
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,889
trailblazers because you know the lot of

1190
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:16,630
us have seen trails but that trail

1191
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:18,730
doesn't go the direction that we want so

1192
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,590
we have to go this other director we see

1193
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,969
that trail and we respect that trail for

1194
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,160
where and what it's done but however

1195
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:26,649
it's it's not our trail and so we have

1196
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,899
to find our own path and so as we're

1197
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,519
pushing forward and as we're educating

1198
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,730
ourselves we have to realize that as

1199
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:35,800
we're educated we have to educate you

1200
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,329
know thousands bull you know I don't

1201
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,769
want to say it's a hierarchy but if you

1202
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:40,239
look at it like a hierarchy then a

1203
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:41,800
thousand below us it's kind of like that

1204
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,719
pyramid scheme we have to educate all

1205
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,570
these people now that would come into

1206
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:48,399
contact or interaction with so any type

1207
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:51,370
of education tool that we can simplify

1208
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,260
the process so by being sent you know

1209
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:56,309
all our factory regions is so

1210
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,630
exponentially we're tied to I remember I

1211
00:49:56,309 --> 00:50:00,400
learned that firsthand after I lost my

1212
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,829
sense of smell for ten years after the

1213
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,039
war until it came back on the dogs fart

1214
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:08,289
but still you know boom terpenes kicked

1215
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:11,139
back in my nose and if you fart eat

1216
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:13,630
herbs yeah fart turfs be as ugly as it

1217
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:18,210
was you know people would drive beaver

1218
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:20,800
turps I had probably five years earlier

1219
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:22,539
right something we could put together

1220
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,050
for people who have lost their sense of

1221
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:26,710
smells

1222
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:28,480
yes beef beaver Terps scent rescuers I

1223
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,519
love it we're talking about preaching to

1224
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,289
the choir on this last trip to Jamaica I

1225
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:34,360
was lucky enough to speak to a roomful

1226
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:37,539
of doctors at an event that was put on

1227
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:40,059
to educate doctors in Jamaica in regards

1228
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:41,860
to prescribing of different medicines we

1229
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:43,150
had some products registered recently

1230
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,789
with the Minister of Health Department

1231
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,340
and so we needed to

1232
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:50,500
educate doctors in regards to you know

1233
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:53,079
first I guess it was really mainly Tony

1234
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,789
who obviously came up with prana and he

1235
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,190
was explaining the United cannabis

1236
00:50:54,789 --> 00:51:00,309
company but I got to be on stage and

1237
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:02,500
talk about sort of trichome glandular

1238
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:04,509
trichomes where the resin is produced

1239
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,900
good timing Tony literally just started

1240
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:10,450
talking about standing up on stage in in

1241
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,760
MoBay in regards to educating doctors

1242
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:14,980
and just was able to kind of give them a

1243
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,510
little bit of a short overview of what

1244
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,940
the glandular trichomes is how the

1245
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:21,720
medicine synthesized inside the head how

1246
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:25,450
we extract and isolated and then Tony

1247
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:29,439
translated that into the medicine into

1248
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:31,809
prana so from the resin lesson Tony went

1249
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,389
up and then spoke about prana and it was

1250
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:36,340
pretty awesome to see because before we

1251
00:51:34,389 --> 00:51:38,559
spoke it was a lot of people speaking

1252
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:41,140
about drug addiction and sort of like a

1253
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,719
lower level of knowledge of cannabis

1254
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:47,969
although I will say that dr. Lorenzo

1255
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,969
Gordon absolutely blew me away with his

1256
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:54,160
what he did with his slides and whatnot

1257
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:55,690
the information that he shared would you

1258
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,399
not agree Tony that that was some of the

1259
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:00,220
deepest science that you'd ever heard

1260
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:03,010
about cannabis and the THC and all the

1261
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:05,079
different molecules agreed agreed he

1262
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:10,000
went deep in explaining how the brain

1263
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:12,940
synapses and receptor work responded to

1264
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,880
different cannabinoids and ratios and

1265
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:17,950
things it's pretty cool it's very cool

1266
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,500
welcome to the room by the way thank you

1267
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:26,739

went to Jamaica and I went to Alaska

1293
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:35,529
that was a lot of you amazeballs

1294
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:38,289
I mean it's cannabis everywhere but it's

1295
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:40,450
like but it's like 1996 everybody's

1296
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:42,550
still clawing you know no one can get

1297
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:45,250
any type of investors or you know

1298
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:47,470
everybody's bootstrapping no but no bank

1299
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:50,710
will give anybody alone and as I said

1300
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:52,959
earlier cost $700 to supply any sample

1301
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:56,139
to the lab to get it tested so they have

1302
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,220
to let it stack up a bit yeah and all

1303
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:59,349
that affects price you know

1304
00:53:57,219 --> 00:54:01,899
unfortunately but it's Reese is still

1305
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:04,358
reasonable edibles are the most popular

1306
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,280
thing there they need bubble man tech

1307
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:07,840
there and they do not have full melt

1308
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,920
they do not have any of that

1309
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,960
unfortunately concentrates are lacking

1310
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,539
and they're working on it but it's very

1311
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,670
difficult with these you know the system

1312
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:21,730
there that they have in place as well as

1313
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:23,200
then you insert Alaska weather and you

1314
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:30,460
know you can see how the comedy can

1315
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:34,719
ensue mm-hmm oh this culture crush is

1316
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:38,769
absolute fire it's so nice to have a

1317
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:42,879
variety of you know fresh heddes if you

1318
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:45,759
will they're the best ones and I think

1319
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,608
the fresh ones that the fresh heddes

1320
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,560
actually this material was was was cured

1321
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:51,699
and dried properly I kind of asked him

1322
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,769
that he did that he was like shall I

1323
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:55,419
leave it fresh frozen I was like why

1324
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:57,219
don't you dry it and I'll give I think

1325
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,070
when you're learning about bubble hash

1326
00:54:57,219 --> 00:55:02,679
it's very important to learn first with

1327
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:04,330
dry material use dry material dry

1328
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:06,098
material also there's no cheating

1329
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:08,259
involved ie wax

1330
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:10,239
membranes filled with moisture that

1331
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:12,789
appeared to be melty on the first few

1332
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:15,759
days of fresh bubble hash being made can

1333
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:18,579
often dry out evaporate and leave a

1334
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:21,909
buttered out non melty finished product

1335
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:24,640
and that's a that's sort of where you

1336
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:26,768
know fresh frozen people love the fresh

1337
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,868
frozen because a it's going to preserve

1338
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:31,088
those very caustic terpenes that we

1339
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:33,970
would otherwise evaporate out I had a

1340
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:37,088
good conversation with my friend Zach in

1341
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:38,528
Ontario who is just 25 years old 20

1342
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:40,268
years younger than me and he just says

1343
00:55:38,528 --> 00:55:42,998
yeah the young people they want all

1344
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:44,768
those as live as fresh and I'm like yeah

1345
00:55:42,998 --> 00:55:46,959
those are kind of like terpenes that for

1346
00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:48,939
what we did four years was we allowed

1347
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,039
those to evaporate out because they were

1348
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,349
so rough and caustic and harsh on our

1349
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,819
throats that now you have this product

1350
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:58,059
that everyone's smoking that's just this

1351
00:55:54,818 --> 00:56:01,150
it just grabs you so harsh it's quite

1352
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:02,769
different from know 20 years ago smoking

1353
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,769
something that was absolutely perfectly

1354
00:56:02,768 --> 00:56:07,808
cured before the hash was even made so

1355
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:10,118
the hash when you make it is perfectly

1356
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:13,710
cured wouldn't you say that there's a

1357
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:13,710
big difference in those two things Sam

1358
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:21,518
absolutely for me yes for both the

1359
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:25,380
reasons you mentioned Welker taste and

1360
00:56:21,518 --> 00:56:30,669
smell and and combustion ability and

1361
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:33,430
also the moisture yeah I really don't

1362
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:36,039
want any moisture trapped you got to get

1363
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:38,078
it out one way or another and I

1364
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:41,079
understand the reason why people like

1365
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:46,210
elevated turkey levels from libraries

1366
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:49,778
erm but it they need a way to to get it

1367
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:55,119
bone-dry I've seen it that way people I

1368
00:56:49,778 --> 00:56:57,639
guess use evaporator ovens or even

1369
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,519
really low temperature freeze dryers or

1370
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:02,618
some sort of something because the stuff

1371
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:04,748
feels just like a dried powder when I

1372
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:06,849
touch it right yeah that sounds like

1373
00:57:04,748 --> 00:57:12,278
freeze dryer some type of evaporated

1374
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:16,259
unit then it's pretty amazing it would

1375
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:19,480
eat whether it's fresh or or dry SEP did

1376
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:22,510
yeah it's so clean that so

1377
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,340
so it's freaking amazing you just got to

1378
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:26,620
get the variety you like the best and

1379
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:29,380
bingo there's definitely something to be

1380
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:31,420
said for how it ignites when you

1381
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:33,070
actually go to dab it or hit it when it

1382
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:38,340
doesn't have that tiny little bit of

1383
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:41,580
moisture it just seems to be like poof

1384
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:44,769
that's how I like it

1385
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:47,590
well THC and most of the terpenes are

1386
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:50,050
pretty darn flammable basically but

1387
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:53,500
they're extremely volatile and if you

1388
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:57,720
catch the volatile part of it on fire

1389
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:01,360
then it sort of that's we see it in

1390
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:05,759
afghan-led booze with flame two or three

1391
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:09,160
feet tall right yeah yeah we have

1392
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,750
indoors that's actually ridiculous when

1393
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:12,579
you're standing next to the hubbly

1394
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,469
bubbly and you're getting a tan on the

1395
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:16,210
side of your face because a flame is

1396
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:18,759
shooting up out at the top of the thing

1397
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:21,780
that's that that's only when you put

1398
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:25,710
your resonance at well it's obviously

1399
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:30,010
wasting some cannabinoids and terpenoids

1400
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:33,820
also the way to get the the biggest air

1401
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:38,050
intake of vaporized cannabis products

1402
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:41,140
then that's possible I mean nothing else

1403
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:43,330
but it's quite like it Afghan hubbly

1404
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:44,679
bubbly water path there's nothing like

1405
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:48,400
it at all that I've ever come across

1406
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:51,609
personally it's by far its the top top

1407
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,680
top four most absolute ripped you can

1408
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:56,800
get from from a bomb like there's

1409
00:58:53,679 --> 00:59:01,859
there's what what could possibly okay

1410
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:04,840
maybe my glass Ham gallon of water

1411
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:08,670
gravity bong is a close second but my

1412
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,670
close I mean like a kilometer and a half

1413
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:16,480
how bubbly is it a real and it you most

1414
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,690
people are saying over the pipes it's

1415
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,389
it's gonna get me too stoned or it's too

1416
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:25,210
much smoke or yeah that's why it's

1417
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:27,489
designed that way you you you have to

1418
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:31,470
hit hit on it hit on it and then take a

1419
00:59:27,489 --> 00:59:34,949
big hit and the purpose is to

1420
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:36,989
get you you know too high it's

1421
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:38,730
therapeutic for certain and I can only

1422
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:40,679
imagine the amount of people in the

1423
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:42,869
history of time that hit that pipe and

1424
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:46,799
then had to go lay down on pillows or

1425
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:52,108
maybe right there on the ground it's

1426
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,609
designed to get you high nothing wrong

1427
00:59:52,108 --> 00:59:56,369
with that you know as we come out of

1428
00:59:53,608 --> 00:59:58,469
prohibition as we you know as this as

1429
00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:02,099
the straightest of the straights the

1430
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:04,379
most conservative Christian right you

1431
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:07,109
know just like the straightest of the

1432
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:09,180
straights as they come to be unbraid

1433
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:11,579
washed with their children and their

1434
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:14,759
loved ones using cannabis as a medicine

1435
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:16,679
I suspect that you know it's still going

1436
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,590
to take a while but at one point in time

1437
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:22,889
we'll really be able to be proud and and

1438
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:26,400
not ashamed to use cannabis for

1439
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:28,769
elevation to call it getting high to say

1440
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,680
I'm getting high and it's a good thing

1441
01:00:28,769 --> 01:00:34,650
don't worry about it it shouldn't be

1442
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:36,929
associated with like I just ate to you

1443
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:39,720
know a bunch of Pharma drugs and I'm

1444
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:42,899
high and I'm given it's not that's all

1445
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:46,169
propaganda what we mean by high is an

1446
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:48,800
elevated state of mind just a really

1447
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:52,440
elevated state of mind one that is

1448
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:54,420
soothing to the $0.05 prison you know

1449
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,159
this that we are currently all locked in

1450
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:59,579
because if you consider that there's

1451
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:02,279
only a small amount of space on the

1452
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:04,799
graph of what it can be seen or what can

1453
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,690
be heard you know that we can't hear

1454
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,000
everything that can be heard with theirs

1455
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:11,099
we're in a very small piece of the pie

1456
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,170
and that's in regards to all our senses

1457
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:15,088
so it's nice to have a plant like

1458
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,670
cannabis to be able to elevate relax

1459
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:23,608
ourselves and sort of soothe that soothe

1460
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:26,579
these senses nitrus huh no offense taken

1461
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:28,858
drew robertson chats ripping along as

1462
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:30,659
always got a whole bunch of people in

1463
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:32,219
there that have been in probably since

1464
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:34,079
this morning when I started the link I

1465
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:36,929
do apologize for starting the link so

1466
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,989
late today I usually start at a day or

1467
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:42,929
two or early and I didn't I didn't start

1468
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:44,098
until this morning at 7:00 a.m. so sorry

1469
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:45,239
for those people that were probably

1470
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:47,940
looking and thinking

1471
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:50,819
oh maybe there's no hash Church today

1472
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:52,500
wouldn't that freak people out after 149

1473
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:55,110
weeks do you guys realize we're like a

1474
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:59,329
couple of months away from three years

1475
01:01:55,110 --> 01:02:03,360
of doing this show every Sunday I think

1476
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:07,789
either have an invisible or a silent

1477
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:10,220
hash Church there you go

1478
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:13,110
that would be the third year anniversary

1479
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:15,029
well just no one will show up I'll open

1480
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:16,650
it but they're just all put below you

1481
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:20,640
know what for the third year anniversary

1482
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:21,420
I insist that we all use dolls as our

1483
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:26,039
avatar

1484
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:28,380
all right strong so start looking now

1485
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:30,809
for the doll that you're gonna use the

1486
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:34,349
little little doll everyone gets to pick

1487
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:37,349
one I got mine already you got yours

1488
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:41,069

1489
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:47,219
face for that episode yeah yeah Sam's

1490
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:49,440
not allowed to use it oh yeah let's make

1491
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:52,169
a 3d you know what that's actually crazy

1492
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,210
you can get these crazy 3d sculptures of

1493
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,950
your face and your body if you oh man

1494
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:59,699
that would be funny for someone to show

1495
01:02:55,949 --> 01:03:02,639
up with windows that'll be Tony who else

1496
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:04,769
right well I just printed yeah just

1497
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:05,879
printed my face probably at the end of

1498
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:08,369
the show he'd be like probably you guys

1499
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:11,880
didn't realize this but my new 3d hash

1500
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:14,130
making machine is uses hash as a process

1501
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,800
as the main substance and we're gonna

1502
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:18,900
dab my head now and he'll just pick his

1503
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,360
head right up off the thing drop it into

1504
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,579
the nail you got to do that Tony yeah

1505
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:28,769
it's a it's a simple resin block that

1506
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:32,969
goes into a poly polyamorous printer we

1507
01:03:28,769 --> 01:03:36,000
could be perfect yeah I'm trying to get

1508
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:37,709
this bubble man thing charged that I

1509
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,250
used last night at the party was pretty

1510
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:42,659
good oh my head off at how funny you

1511
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,219
looked when you take the first when you

1512
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:46,619
took your first dab on that wheelchair

1513
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:48,959
because you literally pushed yourself as

1514
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:51,000
you coughed yeah it looked like a

1515
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,490
cartoon how much smoke you blew out of

1516
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,900
your mouth I was like what you fill that

1517
01:03:53,489 --> 01:04:01,689
thing with glycol

1518
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:03,639
uh-huh glycerin yeah no [ __ ]

1519
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:06,179
apparently Sam's already patented that

1520
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:08,949
dan coroner says

1521
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:11,348
patented what everything whatever you're

1522
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:13,268
talking about it's been done mm-hmm

1523
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:15,759
stop trying look how awesome Sarah's

1524
01:04:13,268 --> 01:04:20,108
background is the idea of Pat named

1525
01:04:15,759 --> 01:04:22,838
anything oh [ __ ] that's that's a novel

1526
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:26,409
and unique idea I'm gonna go grab

1527
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:31,778
another battery I'll be right back don't

1528
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:36,009

just an awesome artist and so that's

1534
01:04:48,338 --> 01:04:51,578
that's what I'm gonna be putting in the

1535
01:04:49,748 --> 01:04:54,669
newspapers and on the telephone poles

1536

it right that's what's doing it right is

1547
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:23,980
all about the whole point is to bring as

1548
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:27,130
many people as possible with a like line

1549
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:29,829
together and give these awesome new

1550
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:32,019
companies that are starting up promotion

1551
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:34,059
and make some make them some money so

1552
01:05:32,018 --> 01:05:37,028
that's like my whole goal is to like

1553
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:41,380
push it as hard as I can in all the

1554
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:46,119
samples tested professor aside I believe

1555
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:49,019
so I believe so well make sure it's

1556
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:52,180
always important that's a good good

1557
01:05:49,018 --> 01:05:56,318
function Canada like I've done it now a

1558
01:05:52,179 --> 01:06:00,219
lot and it's garbage basically every lab

1559
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:01,599
is crappy they're never they never get

1560
01:06:00,219 --> 01:06:05,139
me the towel and they say they're on

1561
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:08,048
again all labs are garbage maybe Canada

1562
01:06:05,139 --> 01:06:09,339
observe garbage but all the one idea all

1563
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:11,860
herbs I

1564
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:14,470
I have a lab for 30 years and it

1565
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:16,599
absolutely was not garbage yeah but you

1566
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:20,500
you had you in the lab and like Dave

1567
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:24,279
paid and like epic like top like the the

1568
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:26,500
upper echelon of like Canada is hurting

1569
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:29,590
I will admit four labs and I've we need

1570
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:31,929
it we need some good labs well in angio

1571
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:36,850
labs is doing a good job Tom pagès group

1572
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:40,869
at UBC so yeah all right a lot of them

1573
01:06:36,849 --> 01:06:43,179
won't test for me because it's a by the

1574
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:44,559
nature of the event they they don't want

1575
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:46,839
to do my testing because they're

1576
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:50,349
licensed dealers so that's another issue

1577
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:52,600
that we have here so this time I'm using

1578
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:53,920
hi North labs they promise me they're

1579
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:55,059
gonna get it to me and it's gonna be

1580
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,119
done that's gonna be all good

1581
01:06:55,059 --> 01:07:00,009
so let's see what happens that'll be

1582
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:01,929
another hot

1583
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:03,760
I find whenever I and I obviously this

1584
01:07:01,929 --> 01:07:05,529
is probably not an option for like

1585
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:09,160
cannabis cups and stuff but whenever I

1586
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:11,710
have sent things to a lab to test it you

1587
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:13,629
know and I'm not testing like 50 things

1588
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:16,630
at a time by any means but when I send

1589
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:19,420
things to a lab to test them I send them

1590
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:21,910
to like two or three labs redundancy for

1591
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:23,710
sure at least I know that's not going to

1592
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:26,019
be an option for the candidate either

1593
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,280
though expensive but when I'm having

1594
01:07:26,019 --> 01:07:29,889
something you know when indras

1595
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:33,160
extracting oil and defatting oil from

1596
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:35,199
protein powder isolate of hampt I don't

1597
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:37,179
want a single lab to tell me the results

1598
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,969
so I got three different labs to tell me

1599
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:42,399
the results in that you definitely see

1600
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:44,980
variation that does not put your heart

1601
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,990
at ease when it's like that [ __ ] was the

1602
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:49,030
same sample like what what were they

1603
01:07:46,989 --> 01:07:52,389
doing that it all came back different

1604
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:54,850
to be honest Marcus Oz you can start by

1605
01:07:52,389 --> 01:07:58,599
just looking at the protocol that they

1606
01:07:54,849 --> 01:08:04,469
use for a GCF might be for terpenes or

1607
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:07,869
an HPLC for cannabinoids if their

1608
01:08:04,469 --> 01:08:11,679
methodology isn't correct then it's

1609
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:14,279
probably not reproducible either right

1610
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:17,349
yeah that makes sense

1611
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:21,338
hey welcome welcome back there dragonfly

1612
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:22,510
medicine hi hit you up all last hit you

1613
01:08:21,338 --> 01:08:24,489
up all last minute

1614
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:26,730
you're like trimming up a crop hey you

1615
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:29,199
want to come to you house church Oh

1616
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:34,000
Sarah's like in bed with no clothes on

1617
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:35,979
oh let me get dressed I'm like I'm

1618
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,350
honored to be on thank you so much for

1619
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:39,909
inviting me yeah absolutely thanks for

1620
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:42,160
for coming back we're just

1621
01:08:39,909 --> 01:08:44,229
oh we're talking about testing we're

1622
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:47,409
talking about pesticides we're talking

1623
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:49,299
about you know the things that we seem

1624
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:51,939
to talk about over and over and over

1625
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:55,840
again wouldn't it just be great if there

1626
01:08:51,939 --> 01:08:57,429
was two different sort of areas like if

1627
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,989
you if you grow with pesticides while

1628
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,000
you kind of have to be over in this

1629
01:08:58,989 --> 01:09:03,069
industry and if you grow without them

1630
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,710
you're in this industry because the lab

1631
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:08,739
testing is just we need to bring the

1632
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:11,409
cost of lab testing down like we need to

1633
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:15,539
bring the costs of what's in that pen

1634
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:18,519
down that looks like a needless Jesus

1635
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:20,640
lose gold are those available now Tony

1636
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:25,930
you said they were gonna be around July

1637
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:27,460
or August first always muted they are

1638
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:29,289
coming along these are the first ones

1639
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:31,869
that got out you know you got a you got

1640
01:09:29,289 --> 01:09:35,439
to test them out are you saying you want

1641
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:38,380
to be a tester oh yeah yeah I'm not

1642
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:39,729
afraid of testing I tell you what's

1643
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,319
interesting about it was kind of last

1644
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:43,599
night got some good reaction is it's a

1645
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:47,469
tank so see how the solution is thicker

1646
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:50,710
on the top and then it goes into a

1647
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:53,230
section right here that's thinner right

1648
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:55,470
and then it's reusable so you could open

1649
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:57,609
up this top over here and refill it

1650
01:09:55,470 --> 01:10:00,369
that's why it doesn't burn out the

1651
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:02,349
flavor right those are those separations

1652
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:04,750
you're only hitting what goes into the

1653
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:06,550
bottom chamber and you only get a little

1654
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:19,479
bit of in there at a time the majority

1655
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:23,470
stays up at the top it's like a dab

1656
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:26,909
trust me yeah we could see okay we

1657
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:29,760
believe I will never hear the same again

1658
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:32,069
how did you enjoy that Natasha

1659
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:38,969
you didn't see that on the all-female

1660
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:41,219
panel Oh Oh my bio essay I think guys

1661
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:44,069
are just naturally more obnoxious I hate

1662
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:46,469
to say it but I think we are you guys

1663
01:10:44,069 --> 01:10:49,259
were so pleasant I was just like I

1664
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:51,689
watched in awe at the women I'm not

1665
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:53,730
joking even now I'm like I can't do it I

1666
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:55,618
don't know how to not talk over people I

1667
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:57,209
don't know how to not be loud I don't

1668
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,408
know how to not say the wrong thing you

1669
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:01,590
mean you don't know how to be polite

1670
01:10:58,408 --> 01:11:04,259
yeah I think so I think so you know it's

1671
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:06,809
just crazy yeah but wouldn't it be a

1672
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,619
real drag if we were all women they're

1673
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:10,800
all men

1674
01:11:07,618 --> 01:11:14,609
I like the oh yeah don't get me wrong

1675
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:17,550
Sam absolutely I'm also a big fan of the

1676
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:19,219
yin and the yang but being the side that

1677
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:22,820
I'm on it was very I just I really

1678
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:26,908
appreciated that panel it was good stuff

1679
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:28,429
did you just fill that up yeah so right

1680
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:31,170
now I mean I just take this little

1681
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:32,309
applicators that we had before you put

1682
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:37,828
it right in between the two little

1683
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:39,750
Stoppers and fill it up Lauren that

1684
01:11:37,828 --> 01:11:41,729
looks surreal bro that looks like three

1685
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,260
little gold drops does anyone else see

1686
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:46,799
what I see yeah the little air bubbles

1687
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:49,050
whoa hey welcome Adrienne we're just

1688
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:53,788
geeks out on resin getting filled into a

1689
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:56,659
pen oh you just don't to you bro yeah I

1690
01:11:53,788 --> 01:11:58,920
see that's pretty exciting yeah right

1691
01:11:56,658 --> 01:12:02,609
we like to geek out on a whole variety

1692
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:05,550
of things here and well [ __ ] why don't

1693
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:07,768
you introduce yourself bro all right

1694
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:10,860
well I'm my name is Adrienne dev Utley I

1695
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:12,389
work with project CBD which is a group

1696
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:15,569
in California that there's a lot of

1697
01:12:12,389 --> 01:12:17,130
Education around cannabis and medicine I

1698
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:19,469
also work with canna craft which is a

1699
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:22,170
producer and distributor in California

1700
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:24,929
I'm Martin Lee's son that's how I got

1701
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:30,690
into this the cannabis world and he says

1702
01:12:24,929 --> 01:12:31,710
hello to everyone thanks yeah so lately

1703
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:35,029
I've been doing a lot of stuff with

1704
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:39,198
pesticides and cannabis and pesticides

1705
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:41,429
but I'm also geek out about filling

1706
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:42,419
cartridges this oil we've been working

1707
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:44,699
on some

1708
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:46,409
some formulations at Kantor craft which

1709
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:47,399
were very fun so I've been doing that a

1710
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:49,710
lot lately

1711
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:51,689
nice nice well you and Tony will have to

1712
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:56,399
link up after this because he's all

1713
01:12:51,689 --> 01:12:57,569
about formulas all about formulas so

1714
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,199
yeah we were also talking about

1715
01:12:57,569 --> 01:13:02,630
pesticides earlier today and just

1716
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:05,130
testing the cost of testing for

1717
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:07,770
pesticides and just you know sort of

1718
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:09,840
overall bummer of not only the product

1719
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:13,260
being so already expensive for these

1720
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:15,539
oils but it being increased by the by

1721
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:18,720
the cost of of having to do high

1722
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:20,189
integrity conscious business which is to

1723
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:23,699
make sure that the product you're

1724
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:25,859
selling isn't toxic poison yeah yeah

1725
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:28,889
which is a setting that that's something

1726
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:30,839
you even have to say allowed well you

1727
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:33,450
know we come from a unique place in this

1728
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,610
industry which is prohibition and in

1729
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:37,739
prohibition we know that all sorts of

1730
01:13:35,609 --> 01:13:39,989
sorts of things end up existing that

1731
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:42,000
aren't really ideal that's kind of one

1732
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:45,329
of the main reasons we've been fighting

1733
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,819
against it that a getting put into

1734
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:49,409
prison getting arrested having our lives

1735
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:52,259
ruined that's one really terrible side

1736
01:13:49,409 --> 01:13:55,229
of it but also selling toxic poison to

1737
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,680
patients is a really big side of it as

1738
01:13:55,229 --> 01:13:58,079
well

1739
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:00,300
yeah I didn't realize until recently

1740
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:02,250
actually how useful sometimes federal

1741
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,409
guidelines are in terms of like

1742
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:05,939
pesticides you know like because every

1743
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:08,489
state's done it differently every state

1744
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:10,500
kind of has to redo it and do it

1745
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:14,639
themselves a try to work with each other

1746
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:17,130
a base on each other but there is some

1747
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,450
you know the there's really limited

1748
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:21,720
information on what happens when you

1749
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:24,389
smoke pesticides you know a lot of a few

1750
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:26,250
pesticides like Michael butanol when you

1751
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:28,829
burn them they break down to cyanide and

1752
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:30,899
ironically cyanide is probably the least

1753
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:33,210
of your concern in those cases because

1754
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:34,889
actually the pesticides are generally

1755
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:36,899
much worse and I don't know if you guys

1756
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:40,590
know it's a workshop and Jeff Raber

1757
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:43,379
but he was I had a conversation with him

1758
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:45,779
because he he was actually explaining

1759
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:47,670
that cyanide isn't nearly as big of an

1760
01:14:45,779 --> 01:14:49,349
issue because when you look at toxicity

1761
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:50,940
you generally measure things by their

1762
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,950
weight cyanide is a really small

1763
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:54,269
molecule and maybe a hundred ton it

1764
01:14:52,949 --> 01:14:56,309
weighs a hundred times less than a

1765
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:58,530
pesticide so if you have like

1766
01:14:56,309 --> 01:15:00,929
ten parts per million cyanide that means

1767
01:14:58,529 --> 01:15:02,969
you have a thousand parts per million of

1768
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:05,550
Michael butanol to begin with and so

1769
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:08,069
actually if you have like a toxic amount

1770
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:10,979
of cyanide and from smoking pesticides

1771
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:15,179
it's a much bigger issue is the

1772
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:16,829
pesticide itself so there's like a lot

1773
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:18,510
of issues about you know are some

1774
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:20,998
pesticides burn too much more toxic

1775
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:24,539
compounds some too much less toxic ones

1776
01:15:20,998 --> 01:15:27,179
in vaporizers you'd probably expect that

1777
01:15:24,538 --> 01:15:29,158
you get a lot more of the pesticide and

1778
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:31,199
that's I think probably the biggest

1779
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:34,138
issue with vaporizers right now is that

1780
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:36,598
if you have dirty oil the way pesticide

1781
01:15:34,139 --> 01:15:38,939
or the way heat breaks things down is a

1782
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:42,719
is a radical mechanism a free radical

1783
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:44,399
sort of thing and cannabinoids are

1784
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,838
potent antioxidants so in your oil

1785
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,419
you're actually going to be preventing

1786
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:50,458
the breakdown of those pesticides much

1787
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:52,618
more if it's in a concentrate than if

1788
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:54,479
it's off of a flower and so this is

1789
01:15:52,618 --> 01:15:58,918
something I'm actually trying to get an

1790
01:15:54,479 --> 01:16:00,958
experiment set up to study this to be

1791
01:15:58,918 --> 01:16:03,269
sure but it would make sense that

1792
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:05,818
actually dirty oil could be much more

1793
01:16:03,269 --> 01:16:07,588
dangerous than dirty flower for for just

1794
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:10,349
for pesticides I mean with smoking there

1795
01:16:07,588 --> 01:16:12,088
are other issues compared to vaporizing

1796
01:16:10,349 --> 01:16:15,179
and although you're concentrating it

1797
01:16:12,088 --> 01:16:17,248
into a ten-time handful tenfold so if

1798
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:20,069
you know 10 grams goes into one gram of

1799
01:16:17,248 --> 01:16:23,998
a concentrated distillate you're ten

1800
01:16:20,069 --> 01:16:26,219
times the concentration value right so

1801
01:16:23,998 --> 01:16:27,898
if you're not clean you're just gonna

1802
01:16:26,219 --> 01:16:30,868
get dirtier and dirtier as you

1803
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:34,349
concentrate that yeah the other thing is

1804
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:36,868
a bunch of pesticides are actually

1805
01:16:34,349 --> 01:16:39,088
somewhat similar to cannabinoids

1806
01:16:36,868 --> 01:16:42,088
chemically not necessarily like the the

1807
01:16:39,088 --> 01:16:44,698
exact structure but pyrethrins which is

1808
01:16:42,088 --> 01:16:47,128
a natural pesticide comes from

1809
01:16:44,698 --> 01:16:48,658
chrysanthemum on there have pretty much

1810
01:16:47,128 --> 01:16:51,088
the same boiling point pretty much the

1811
01:16:48,658 --> 01:16:52,828
same polarity they collude together so

1812
01:16:51,088 --> 01:16:56,668
you can actually have when you

1813
01:16:52,828 --> 01:16:59,338
concentrate THC from 20% to 70%

1814
01:16:56,668 --> 01:17:01,469
you can end up concentrating pyrethrins

1815
01:16:59,338 --> 01:17:02,969
from like one part per million to even

1816
01:17:01,469 --> 01:17:05,368
more than that to like ten parts per

1817
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:07,889
million it can sometimes be more

1818
01:17:05,368 --> 01:17:09,478
concentrated than you can constantly

1819
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:09,900
sometimes it concentrates better than

1820
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:12,060
the action

1821
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:16,019
cannabinoids or terpenes that you want

1822
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:18,000
to concentrate more nightmares you know

1823
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,790
my buddy I'll never forget my Rasta

1824
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,560
friend Mikey on the top of the

1825
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:24,090
mountaintop and Remo might have even

1826
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,580
been with us there you had to climb the

1827
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:28,440
craziest gnarly like coral that probably

1828
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:30,149
was under the ocean a million years ago

1829
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:31,979
to get to the top of this guy's Mountain

1830
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:33,839
damn near killed ourselves getting up

1831
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:36,359
there sliced ourselves all up we get up

1832
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,310
there he's got like 50 gallon buckets up

1833
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:40,109
there that he brought up on his head and

1834
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:42,840
he says to me just simply put he's

1835
01:17:40,109 --> 01:17:44,670
looking for some sugarcane just to hand

1836
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,860
crush for me so I can have a little

1837
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:48,719
drink while I'm up there and he's he's

1838
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:50,729
going to pick the the sugarcane and he's

1839
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,198
like he's looking he's look and he's

1840
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:53,519
looking he's like this is the one I'm

1841
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:55,289
like why'd you pick that when he slice

1842
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,239
you see this and I say yeah it's a

1843
01:17:55,289 --> 01:18:00,719
wormhole it says the worm likes this one

1844
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:03,029
that means it's not poisoned I'm like

1845
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:05,189
dude that's [ __ ] crazy because the

1846
01:18:03,029 --> 01:18:07,469
what went at home when the worms like it

1847
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:09,569
they spray that [ __ ] with poison to kill

1848
01:18:07,469 --> 01:18:12,300
the worms and here he is using the worms

1849
01:18:09,569 --> 01:18:14,849
as his natural thermometer to find

1850
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,250
safety regions on his little island that

1851
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:19,110
many people's poor content spray

1852
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:21,119
pesticides on I mean imagine living on

1853
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:24,689
an island and you're all like I want to

1854
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:26,969
be organic and everyone's like DDT put

1855
01:18:24,689 --> 01:18:29,549
more on your on your ground like it's

1856
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:32,069
crazy dude yeah I have a funny story

1857
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:34,380
about that as well we used to do a lot

1858
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:36,899
of farmers markets and settle all of our

1859
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:39,390
vegetables and stuff on Saturday market

1860
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:41,279
and these old Quaker families used to

1861
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:43,590
come down they were all in their 70s and

1862
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:46,469
80s and all look through all of the top

1863
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:48,239
of our corn so they're unpeeling the

1864
01:18:46,469 --> 01:18:50,550
corn and I was sort of like what are you

1865
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,408
all doing and she said well if the corn

1866
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:55,289
worm is not in there then I don't trust

1867
01:18:52,408 --> 01:18:57,658
it I won't trust any corn that doesn't

1868
01:18:55,289 --> 01:19:00,359
have the corn worm and they're delicious

1869
01:18:57,658 --> 01:19:01,769
to eat as well so she would just pop and

1870
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:03,960
right in her mouth and I asked her what

1871
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:08,100
they tasted like he she said like sweet

1872
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:11,279
corn so it was pretty like that story

1873
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:13,560
yeah it's pretty well it's the truth

1874
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:18,869
right it's the simple simple simple and

1875
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:22,360
Wow question about the perineum perineum

1876
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:25,880
that's been tested positive for

1877
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:28,729
cannabis where is that from is it from

1878
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:32,779
the resin from the seed from the leaves

1879
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:36,229
of flowers and stems of roots where are

1880
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:39,050
you finding it from it's not it assuming

1881
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:41,809
it's not just extraction yeah usually

1882
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:45,110
we've tested in flower usually so when

1883
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:46,850
you test it on leaves or like stems or

1884
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:50,539
something sometimes you see a little bit

1885
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:52,610
that's pyrethrins break down pretty

1886
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:54,829
quickly in sunlight the half-life's like

1887
01:19:52,609 --> 01:19:57,259
8 hours or something but in the

1888
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:59,359
trichomes when it's when it's kind of

1889
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:02,180
collected alongside these cannabinoids

1890
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:04,239
which again it fits really well it kind

1891
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:10,579
of intercalate that's my question

1892
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:12,800
just inside of your head are you sure so

1893
01:20:10,579 --> 01:20:17,059
we're not sure in chrysanthemum it's

1894
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,800
mostly produced in the trichomes in

1895
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:20,990
chrysanthemum it's almost exclusively

1896
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:23,570
and producing the trichomes and then the

1897
01:20:20,989 --> 01:20:26,420
mother plant actually pushes it into the

1898
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:28,549
seeds to protect the seeds from insect

1899
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:33,230
but it would either have to have the

1900
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:35,270
ability to or not yeah and so we've we

1901
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:37,039
actually there's Kevin mckernon and I

1902
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:39,530
and a couple people at Sonoma Labs in

1903
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:42,010
California we just recently submitted a

1904
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:44,300
paper about this about the potential for

1905
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:46,789
cannabis to produce pyrethrins because

1906
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:49,880
we've been trying to explain why so many

1907
01:20:46,789 --> 01:20:52,670
people are testing positive um it's the

1908
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,900
the preprints online I won't talk about

1909
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:58,100
it too much because it hasn't been

1910
01:20:53,899 --> 01:21:00,379
reviewed yet but the preprint you can

1911
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,840
see it's a few Google endogenous

1912
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:04,850
synthesis of pyrethrins by cannabis and

1913
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:08,060
we looked at the genetics and there are

1914
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:10,579
a bunch of genetic markers urgent the

1915
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:12,650
enzymes that produce a pyrethrins and

1916
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:15,409
chrysanthemum there are many homologs to

1917
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:18,049
that in cannabis um and we find it very

1918
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:21,199
often in cannabis flowers when we tests

1919
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:22,610
cannabis flowers it also comes up in the

1920
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:26,179
concentrate but that's much less

1921
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:28,130
surprising but I would expect that if it

1922
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:31,820
is in fact being synthesized in cannabis

1923
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:34,220
it would be in the trichomes and how how

1924
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:36,159
is it produced is a produced by

1925
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:39,550
synthesis for example

1926
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:41,139
yes so there's a common pathway a lot of

1927
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:43,110
plants have these chirpy you know they

1928
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:48,910
make terpenes pyrethrins are a terpenoid

1929
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:51,579
and they're kind of two main steps one

1930
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:53,789
of them is from a fatty acid and this is

1931
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:58,180
fairly common in many plant species it's

1932
01:21:53,789 --> 01:22:00,899
making a jazz Malone and is it a

1933
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:06,579
monoterpene or a sesquiterpene so it's

1934
01:22:00,899 --> 01:22:10,509
it's a two mono terpenoids there's a

1935
01:22:06,579 --> 01:22:12,309
ester bond that's formed and so it's a

1936
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:14,770
one monitor Prannoy is called

1937
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:17,620
chrysanthemum chrysanthemum or

1938
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:19,680
chrysanthemum acid it was discovered in

1939
01:22:17,619 --> 01:22:22,029
chrysanthemum first and the other is

1940
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:25,390
jazz Malone so those are the two

1941
01:22:22,029 --> 01:22:28,659
monoterpenes that are formed and then

1942
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:30,760
just an ester linkage is made by an

1943
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:33,880
enzyme that's also very common to many

1944
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:36,789
plants and so that's how it's done in

1945
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:38,289
chrysanthemum and there are there we

1946
01:22:36,789 --> 01:22:41,199
have some evidence that that could be

1947
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:44,979
happening in cannabis as well well

1948
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:48,010
Kevin's may have to look yeah no he's

1949
01:22:44,979 --> 01:22:50,859
he's he was one of the big main people

1950
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:54,640
pushing that project and if you know

1951
01:22:50,859 --> 01:22:55,899
depending on this first the response

1952
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:58,510
kind of this first paper we're gonna

1953
01:22:55,899 --> 01:23:01,269
look at actually trying to express or

1954
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:03,670
model these genes from cannabis in

1955
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:06,460
another like in a bacterial species to

1956
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:08,079
see if if the genes that are present in

1957
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:10,659
cannabis the enzymes that are present in

1958
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:12,100
cannabis can make it outside of cannabis

1959
01:23:10,659 --> 01:23:14,079
or if it's something just weird that's

1960
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:16,329
going on with like you know there are a

1961
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:17,529
lot of nutrients that have pyrethrins or

1962
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:19,930
other pesticides in them and aren't

1963
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:21,639
labeled and so part of the issue is

1964
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:24,490
certainly that that people are

1965
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:26,530
unknowingly adding pyrethrins some of it

1966
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:27,849
is just bad practice where people are

1967
01:23:26,529 --> 01:23:32,289
using pyrethrins and other pesticides

1968
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:34,450
and say they don't but i think it is

1969
01:23:32,289 --> 01:23:37,720
very possible that canvas is making it

1970
01:23:34,449 --> 01:23:39,639
but i'm i definitely want to see some

1971
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:44,619
more research to that effect before

1972
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:45,489
saying anything definitively I'm

1973
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:48,760
surprised

1974
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:52,658
that dr. Soleil and other people who

1975
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:56,079
have who look for compounds or doctor

1976
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:59,859
machines folks haven't found it before

1977
01:23:56,078 --> 01:24:01,899
but maybe I'm mistaken and they have I

1978
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:04,359
didn't look a little literature yeah

1979
01:24:01,899 --> 01:24:06,038
there it hasn't been found before I -

1980
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:09,339
comments on that one is you know the

1981
01:24:06,038 --> 01:24:11,948
recent marijuana that got sent to sue

1982
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:15,038
Sisley for a study on PTSD that had a

1983
01:24:11,948 --> 01:24:17,828
bunch of like you know contaminants in

1984
01:24:15,038 --> 01:24:19,809
it so I have a lot of respect for Elle

1985
01:24:17,828 --> 01:24:22,808
solely but that doesn't you know they

1986
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:27,909
haven't looked for everything and but

1987
01:24:22,809 --> 01:24:31,380
and also dr. oh so late - I I don't want

1988
01:24:27,908 --> 01:24:36,518
to defend crappy weed but that's what he

1989
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:39,760
contracted by the NID ages he he he

1990
01:24:36,519 --> 01:24:42,159
can't produce higher quality he has the

1991
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:45,010
ability to but that's not what the

1992
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:48,908
contract is for and does the contract

1993
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:55,210
actually say crappy weed says crappy

1994
01:24:48,908 --> 01:24:57,488
Mexican Shui damn but wouldn't it be it

1995
01:24:55,210 --> 01:25:00,698
wouldn't be Mexican trying it to get rid

1996
01:24:57,488 --> 01:25:03,998
of all the fines in other words the

1997
01:25:00,698 --> 01:25:06,488
resin does it fell off they want to

1998
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:11,189
remove that so it doesn't clog up their

1999
01:25:06,488 --> 01:25:13,598
bonsai the best but but what do I mean

2000
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:17,710
do they are they growing like just

2001
01:25:13,599 --> 01:25:22,389
Mexican landraces you think 150 days bro

2002
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:31,029
- 50 day flowering yeah 150 day

2003
01:25:22,389 --> 01:25:33,010
flowering you think III don't know on

2004
01:25:31,029 --> 01:25:35,408
the hardest straight possible pulling it

2005
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:37,389
at day 60 - so we can get the least out

2006
01:25:35,408 --> 01:25:39,429
of it you know it's a hundred and fifty

2007
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:42,190
day flowering but why do I grow it all

2008
01:25:39,429 --> 01:25:44,618
the way was a paper that just came out

2009
01:25:42,189 --> 01:25:46,960
looking at how night as marijuana

2010
01:25:44,618 --> 01:25:49,299
compares to markets I think was in

2011
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,948
Colorado I mean the main thing they

2012
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:53,440
found was there was like 10 to 20 times

2013
01:25:50,948 --> 01:25:56,408
more CBN which for those who you don't

2014
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:58,388
know at CBN is what THC and CBD convert

2015
01:25:56,408 --> 01:25:58,899
to when it's left in the sunlight for a

2016
01:25:58,389 --> 01:26:02,710
long time

2017
01:25:58,899 --> 01:26:05,799
so I pay for they also say store it for

2018
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:09,250
3-4 years it will start to convert to

2019
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:11,770
CBN and you get a full conversion on

2020
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,909
that method with what CBD to CBN I

2021
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:15,850
didn't I didn't know you could do that

2022
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:20,829
let C be a CBD deceive you it could

2023
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:25,750
happen if I guess it would be CBD eat a

2024
01:26:20,829 --> 01:26:28,869
THC to CBN a CBD can convert to THC it

2025
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:31,600
doesn't really happen in physiological

2026
01:26:28,869 --> 01:26:34,269
like it wouldn't happen on the plane

2027
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,700
yeah but if it's left in like high heat

2028
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:39,120
or sunlight for a very long time it

2029
01:26:36,699 --> 01:26:39,119
could happen

2030
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:48,010
definitely all good stuff go ahead and

2031
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:51,720
Natasha oh I just wanted to ask you any

2032
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:54,909
other plants besides chrysanthemum me

2033
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:57,100
the pur Thea

2034
01:26:54,909 --> 01:27:00,399
I've heard it said many ways pyrethrins

2035
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:01,750
is how I usually say just one thing

2036
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:04,349
about pyrethrins there are six different

2037
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:07,890
compounds it's a family of compounds

2038
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:11,680
there are a couple other species that

2039
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:16,590
can make it i Artemisia I think is one

2040
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:19,480
of them on.i it's mentioned we looked at

2041
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:20,739
three other we looked at chrysanthemum

2042
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:21,729
was the main when they were we are

2043
01:27:20,739 --> 01:27:25,689
looking at but there are two other

2044
01:27:21,729 --> 01:27:30,399
species that it's been reported in one

2045
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:32,679
or two papers that it may happen and you

2046
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:35,109
know when you look at terpenes sorry was

2047
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,220
that finished and then i'll ask when you

2048
01:27:35,109 --> 01:27:38,170
look at terpenes you know it's one of

2049
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:40,720
the most conserved pathways and plants

2050
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,899
it's what plants make to defend

2051
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,740
themselves to attract you know

2052
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:48,369
pollinators and things like that

2053
01:27:44,739 --> 01:27:52,149
and it's a very modular sort of pathway

2054
01:27:48,369 --> 01:27:54,159
where you know one you can choose

2055
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:56,739
between 200 enzymes that will make

2056
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:58,949
different sorts of that will kind of

2057
01:27:56,739 --> 01:28:02,679
take one piece and make the next and so

2058
01:27:58,949 --> 01:28:04,029
if you have the enzymes for you know

2059
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:06,100
some plants have some of the enzymes

2060
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:07,840
that make like Chris Anthony acid but

2061
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:10,690
not the ones that will combine it with

2062
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,699
jasmine to make pyrethrins and so it's

2063
01:28:10,689 --> 01:28:18,939
it's sort of like a mix and match of may

2064
01:28:12,698 --> 01:28:21,129
different terpenoid compounds and so why

2065
01:28:18,939 --> 01:28:23,169
is chrysanthemum making this product

2066
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:25,300
it's a defense mechanism is that

2067
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:29,859
naturally what it's happening yeah and

2068
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:32,619
so then he induced like if the plant was

2069
01:28:29,859 --> 01:28:36,809
under attack could it be induced to be

2070
01:28:32,619 --> 01:28:39,519
expressed is that okay when when it's

2071
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:41,440
there are two different ways that it can

2072
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,210
be induced or it's known to be I guess

2073
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:45,428
three one of them is what I mentioned

2074
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:47,230
before when a mother plant makes seeds

2075
01:28:45,429 --> 01:28:49,960
it actually coats some of the seed and

2076
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:52,238
pyrethrins when they start getting eaten

2077
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:55,270
by plants there's a d'oeuvre excuse me

2078
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:59,049
kaya insects there's a it gets induced

2079
01:28:55,270 --> 01:29:01,270
and also when chrysanthemum releases

2080
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:04,210
certain volatile organic compounds

2081
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:06,070
certain other terpenes that signals to

2082
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:09,520
its neighbors usually it's under attack

2083
01:29:06,069 --> 01:29:11,649
produce more pyrethrins so when someone

2084
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,440
plants under attack it not only makes

2085
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:16,779
pyrethrins but makes other terpenes that

2086
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:18,928
signal to the plants nearby hey there

2087
01:29:16,779 --> 01:29:23,519
you know there's this insect in the area

2088
01:29:18,929 --> 01:29:23,520
you know you got to defend yourself and

2089
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:31,739
so you said your next steps with this

2090
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:34,989
research were to confirm these pathways

2091
01:29:31,738 --> 01:29:37,299
in like cell culture experiments or what

2092
01:29:34,988 --> 01:29:40,178
what's your next steps to show if this

2093
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:42,699
is actually happening or you know moving

2094
01:29:40,179 --> 01:29:44,140
beyond just this is a hypothesis it

2095
01:29:42,698 --> 01:29:48,460
could be happening how do you prove this

2096
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:50,170
um so I think it partly it just depends

2097
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:52,119
on what we have access to and kind of

2098
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:53,859
the people we know and you know I I'm

2099
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:56,529
friends with Kevin mckernon of medicinal

2100
01:29:53,859 --> 01:29:59,948
genomics and so that was a very easy way

2101
01:29:56,529 --> 01:30:03,159
to start I what I would like to see is a

2102
01:29:59,948 --> 01:30:06,279
just larger grows with like many plants

2103
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:09,760
and and you know actually trying to ruin

2104
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:11,439
the plants to see for harvesting to see

2105
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,130
does that actually induce it something

2106
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:19,719
like that um so a just replicating it is

2107
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:21,750
a very common way to demonstrate

2108
01:30:19,719 --> 01:30:24,550
something and also taking the actual

2109
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:26,260
genetics that we found and expressing

2110
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:29,110
that either doing a computer

2111
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:31,840
model of those enzymes or expressing

2112
01:30:29,109 --> 01:30:34,149
them in a bacteria and showing that when

2113
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,219
you give a bacteria the the right genes

2114
01:30:34,149 --> 01:30:37,988
from cannabis it can make pyrethrins and

2115
01:30:36,219 --> 01:30:41,368
so that would be very very strong proof

2116
01:30:37,988 --> 01:30:45,729
but honestly first I just like to see

2117
01:30:41,368 --> 01:30:47,109
better like more replicas of this that

2118
01:30:45,729 --> 01:30:48,609
you know people growing it in very

2119
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:50,698
controlled environments you test the

2120
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:53,799
water you test the soil you test

2121
01:30:50,698 --> 01:30:55,238
everything and show that it didn't come

2122
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,969
from any source it didn't come from her

2123
01:30:55,238 --> 01:31:01,149
fertilizer or the ground or the water it

2124
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:05,948
came from the plant did you say that per

2125
01:31:01,149 --> 01:31:09,578
idiom in chrysanthemums has four or six

2126
01:31:05,948 --> 01:31:13,058
different terpene compounds I six yeah

2127
01:31:09,578 --> 01:31:16,988
six okay and you said in cannabis I

2128
01:31:13,059 --> 01:31:19,420
found two of those six um so in cannabis

2129
01:31:16,988 --> 01:31:24,009
we were looking for only one of them um

2130
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:25,420
and if that the paper which is up on the

2131
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:27,789
bio archive again it hasn't been

2132
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:30,969
reviewed yet and I already seen the

2133
01:31:27,788 --> 01:31:34,420
process one of the issues we actually

2134
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:37,840
had was that pyrethrins it the pyrethrin

2135
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:40,359
one is one of the compounds and that's

2136
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:43,599
normally with you test for that's really

2137
01:31:40,359 --> 01:31:46,238
what's tested for four limits in like

2138
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:47,710
California and Oregon um because it's

2139
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:50,319
the most common it's not actually the

2140
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:54,250
most potent it's insecticidal properties

2141
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:57,460
but um we only tested for one and there

2142
01:31:54,250 --> 01:32:01,929
was some the the mass spec was a little

2143
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:04,480
bit surprising that we had from it there

2144
01:32:01,929 --> 01:32:05,800
was it seemed like there was another

2145
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:07,448
compound there that we weren't really

2146
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:10,570
sure what it was and it might have been

2147
01:32:07,448 --> 01:32:11,919
an isomer of pyrethrins or it might have

2148
01:32:10,569 --> 01:32:13,599
been actually a different compound

2149
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,250
that's similar you know as I said these

2150
01:32:13,599 --> 01:32:16,630
terpenes are sort of when you're

2151
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:19,569
combining them it's a mix and match for

2152
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:21,969
what enzyme so the plant has and so it

2153
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:24,308
might be making something that's very

2154
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:26,800
similar to pyrethrins we're pretty sure

2155
01:32:24,309 --> 01:32:30,550
it's making at least pyrethrin one from

2156
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:32,619
this paper from this data but it might

2157
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:35,400
be making other similar compounds that

2158
01:32:32,618 --> 01:32:38,578
just really look like pyrethrins

2159
01:32:35,399 --> 01:32:38,578
pyrethrin one

2160
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:48,980
the reason I'm asking is because if it

2161
01:32:45,469 --> 01:32:52,850
has all six compounds it's obviously

2162
01:32:48,979 --> 01:32:56,049
gonna be a pretty effective supply of

2163
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:58,640
iridium whereas if it's got one of them

2164
01:32:56,050 --> 01:33:02,179
maybe it's less effective and less

2165
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:07,130
damaging and I've never heard of this so

2166
01:33:02,179 --> 01:33:08,510
I'm really quite surprised I my turn it

2167
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:13,460
might be a little bit bad I couldn't

2168
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:16,000
hear that very well I just said I'm very

2169
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:18,439
surprised that it's bound to cannabis

2170
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,658
yeah well as I said you know it's it's

2171
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:25,789
preliminary evidence and I would like to

2172
01:33:20,658 --> 01:33:28,309
see more data before we start saying

2173
01:33:25,789 --> 01:33:30,019
that cannabis produces pyrethrins I

2174
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:33,909
think we have some evidence that it can

2175
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:36,350
but you know and another thing is that

2176
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:38,779
it definitely doesn't happen in every

2177
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:43,340
plant a lot of the plants that we test

2178
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:45,920
for in Sonoma County test positive but

2179
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:49,039
also a lot of growers use pyrethrins we

2180
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,960
have found plants that consistently test

2181
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:52,550
negative

2182
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:53,658
they've been CBD plants for the most

2183
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:56,510
part and I'm not sure if that's

2184
01:33:53,658 --> 01:34:05,389
coincidence or you know that the

2185
01:33:56,510 --> 01:34:07,840
genetics might be linked you can also do

2186
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:10,610
an experiment where you're looking at

2187
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,500
like I guess what what kind of pathogen

2188
01:34:10,609 --> 01:34:16,609
would this be specific for that they're

2189
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:18,800
using the sprays for mites or what sex

2190
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:21,889
and mites yeah yeah so I guess you could

2191
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,630
even do like plants in a controlled

2192
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:25,760
environment that are might and tested

2193
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:28,400
versus plants that aren't and see like

2194
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:32,239
if this is happening is it inducible is

2195
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,769
it is it because like you're saying some

2196
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:36,198
plants are showing it some plants aren't

2197
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:37,550
potentially and I was also wondering if

2198
01:34:36,198 --> 01:34:40,928
you could speak a little bit about if

2199
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:44,570
this is true how is this gonna affect

2200
01:34:40,929 --> 01:34:49,609
pesticide testing and what do you think

2201
01:34:44,569 --> 01:34:51,170
about that yeah well pesticide testing

2202
01:34:49,609 --> 01:34:53,598
there's a whole other issue with that in

2203
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:56,029
California project CBD did a real

2204
01:34:53,599 --> 01:35:00,349
like a twenty-something page report on

2205
01:34:56,029 --> 01:35:05,228
the initial proposed regulations then

2206
01:35:00,349 --> 01:35:08,840
those regulations were essentially

2207
01:35:05,229 --> 01:35:10,668
repealed under a different law and new

2208
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,369
regulations are going to be passed under

2209
01:35:10,668 --> 01:35:14,269
an emergency ordinance in

2210
01:35:12,368 --> 01:35:15,768
september/october and there won't be a

2211
01:35:14,269 --> 01:35:20,090
public comment period because it'll be

2212
01:35:15,769 --> 01:35:22,340
an emergency law it's it's a very weird

2213
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:24,168
setup in California right now there are

2214
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:27,279
a lot of other issues I would say you

2215
01:35:24,168 --> 01:35:29,479
know the initial pesticide regulations

2216
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:30,858
you know if you're looking at the

2217
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:31,909
toxicity of pesticides you have to

2218
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:34,280
figure out how much you're actually

2219
01:35:31,908 --> 01:35:35,779
using and so they had an estimate on

2220
01:35:34,279 --> 01:35:37,429
like edible consumption and their

2221
01:35:35,779 --> 01:35:39,498
estimate was 10 percent of your body

2222
01:35:37,429 --> 01:35:41,389
weight so that's you know assuming that

2223
01:35:39,498 --> 01:35:43,698
I'm eating 12 pounds of marijuana

2224
01:35:41,389 --> 01:35:45,168
edibles a day and that was part of where

2225
01:35:43,698 --> 01:35:48,228
the limits came from that's part of why

2226
01:35:45,168 --> 01:35:53,288
they're so so low in California and I

2227
01:35:48,229 --> 01:35:55,878
really want to be pushing higher pests

2228
01:35:53,288 --> 01:35:58,518
limits you know I think farmers should

2229
01:35:55,878 --> 01:36:00,800
be using organic practices are not doing

2230
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:04,369
monoculture that helps with pests and

2231
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:11,899
weeds there's a lot of other things that

2232
01:36:04,368 --> 01:36:14,179
can help avoid it just make the farming

2233
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:16,070
practices easier without pesticides be

2234
01:36:14,179 --> 01:36:20,779
much better but flow and just kind of

2235
01:36:16,069 --> 01:36:22,668
arbitrarily so um again a 10% of your

2236
01:36:20,779 --> 01:36:25,219
body weight eating that much in edibles

2237
01:36:22,668 --> 01:36:27,948
every day is a is a quite an over

2238
01:36:25,219 --> 01:36:30,078
estimate but then the regulations on

2239
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:32,478
smoke products were based on tobacco and

2240
01:36:30,078 --> 01:36:34,788
tobacco has lobbied really hard against

2241
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:40,458
any regulations so those are actually in

2242
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:42,469
many ways too lenient I mean they're yes

2243
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:44,358
so there are a lot of issues independent

2244
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:48,349
of that as far as canvas making

2245
01:36:44,359 --> 01:36:50,809
pyrethrins if that does pan out one of

2246
01:36:48,349 --> 01:36:52,429
the big questions is for how long has it

2247
01:36:50,809 --> 01:36:54,769
been doing this because it could be that

2248
01:36:52,429 --> 01:36:57,408
in this election away from CBD strains

2249
01:36:54,769 --> 01:36:59,719
maybe it's linked to the THC a synthase

2250
01:36:57,408 --> 01:37:02,268
enzyme and so in some way and so it

2251
01:36:59,719 --> 01:37:05,899
could be that it doesn't necessarily

2252
01:37:02,269 --> 01:37:07,909
guarantee the safety of pyrethrins if

2253
01:37:05,899 --> 01:37:10,309
if cannabis has been making pyrethrins

2254
01:37:07,909 --> 01:37:12,109
for a very long time then all of the

2255
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:14,750
evidence about smoking cannabis being

2256
01:37:12,109 --> 01:37:16,399
safe and not causing lung cancer or oral

2257
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:18,319
cancers then that would apply to

2258
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,059
pyrethrins it wouldn't apply to

2259
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:24,139
concentrates and remember how I said

2260
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:25,789
before how the breakdown of pesticides

2261
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,470
when you vape off concentrates is

2262
01:37:25,789 --> 01:37:29,989
actually probably much less than when

2263
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:33,140
you smoke it so it wouldn't necessarily

2264
01:37:29,989 --> 01:37:35,479
speak to the safety of pyrethrins and

2265
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:38,660
concentrates but it would probably

2266
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:41,529
indicate that smoking pyrethrins you

2267
01:37:38,659 --> 01:37:43,579
know slow doses of pyrethrins not like

2268
01:37:41,529 --> 01:37:47,779
reference but you know parts per million

2269
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:50,479
concentration are probably I it would

2270
01:37:47,779 --> 01:37:53,569
suggest that they're safe you know

2271
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:56,089
relatively safe um again I don't want to

2272
01:37:53,569 --> 01:37:57,349
be claiming that like it's Oh pesticides

2273
01:37:56,090 --> 01:38:00,319
are fine you know a lot of these

2274
01:37:57,350 --> 01:38:03,140
pesticides are fairly toxic but

2275
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:04,849
pyrethrins if you look chemically at its

2276
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:06,920
structure it it will break down into

2277
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:10,010
those two monoterpenes neither of which

2278
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:16,100
are particularly toxic when you burn it

2279
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:22,430
so I think again smoking pyrethrins is

2280
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:25,570
probably safer than vaporizing them but

2281
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:27,650
really we just need safety studies and

2282
01:38:25,569 --> 01:38:30,319
because again because of the tobacco

2283
01:38:27,649 --> 01:38:31,819
industry largely it's lobbying there's

2284
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:35,840
been very little information on what

2285
01:38:31,819 --> 01:38:38,179
happens when you burn pesticides so so

2286
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:40,340
we're science they're safety more

2287
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:42,619
education we need more of that you know

2288
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:44,329
and I'm thankfully there's youth like

2289
01:38:42,619 --> 01:38:46,760
you that are looking into and looking

2290
01:38:44,329 --> 01:38:48,289
past these things so that we can get a

2291
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,810
but a better understanding overall I

2292
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:52,579
know it Sam's done over the decades but

2293
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:54,890
at the same time you know we have to

2294
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:57,609
push this further and you know keep at

2295
01:38:54,890 --> 01:39:01,010
the research and and by the way I

2296
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:05,569
patented a new variety called iridium

2297
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:10,159
free and it's guaranteed to have 0 ppm

2298
01:39:05,569 --> 01:39:13,429
in it man you work quick yeah you were I

2299
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:16,609
know I've been in the in the in the

2300
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:19,140
wings waiting for this

2301
01:39:16,609 --> 01:39:20,519
man you must have that Pandavas on

2302
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:23,610
overdrive that must be on speed-dial

2303
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,560
yell he patented the Patent Office

2304
01:39:23,609 --> 01:39:29,309
actually they can't do anything without

2305
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:36,020
paying him true

2306
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:38,910
that I told so true oh my goodness well

2307
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:40,920
I'm feeling pretty irate so were there

2308
01:39:38,909 --> 01:39:43,050
specific genetics that you were finding

2309
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:48,810
the pyrethrins in or is it just across

2310
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:55,380
the spectrum sorry I didn't hear the

2311
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:58,760
beginning of that oh I didn't hear the

2312
01:39:55,380 --> 01:40:00,869
beginning of that it was just for gum

2313
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:03,590
you want to know what your question was

2314
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:06,840
I remember your question there you go

2315
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:08,789
okay it was was when you collected it

2316
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,860
was was it from a specific cultivar or

2317
01:40:08,789 --> 01:40:14,100
just a variety of cultivars that you

2318
01:40:10,859 --> 01:40:18,119
found these um yeah we were so we have

2319
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:20,250
been testing I mean I I was working with

2320
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:23,789
Sonoma lab works which is a testing lab

2321
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:25,949
and in cat in Northern California and so

2322
01:40:23,789 --> 01:40:30,420
we've been testing all sorts of plans

2323
01:40:25,949 --> 01:40:32,579
but this was the the experiment that we

2324
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:35,279
did that were it's in the publication

2325
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:38,510
process that was with hydroponically

2326
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:40,859
grown in a closed system and it was I

2327
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:43,949
believe it were they were rebel grown

2328
01:40:40,859 --> 01:40:48,929
seeds that that company from I think

2329
01:40:43,949 --> 01:40:53,819
this strain was meta haze but I would

2330
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:59,280
have to check that it's well there it is

2331
01:40:53,819 --> 01:41:01,889
there it is there it is looks like

2332
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:04,800
someone's have enough talk the reason

2333
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:10,770
haze get you so high is because it's got

2334
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:15,650
some freakin breaking oh my god I put

2335
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:15,650
out to the right but everybody in that

2336
01:41:16,489 --> 01:41:23,130
would be a that would be that can't be

2337
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:24,900
Sam there's no way although we're gonna

2338
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:26,909
learn a lot of stuff in the upcoming

2339
01:41:24,899 --> 01:41:28,859
years about these pathways and these

2340
01:41:26,909 --> 01:41:33,619
relationships that are yet under

2341
01:41:28,859 --> 01:41:36,210
you know not quite understood incredible

2342
01:41:33,619 --> 01:41:38,460
Adrienne I wanted to thank you for your

2343
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:40,319
work and what you all are doing is

2344
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:43,350
really phenomenal I've been keeping up

2345
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:45,029
with your work and and everything that

2346
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:46,500
you all are putting out the new papers

2347
01:41:45,029 --> 01:41:48,750
that you all are putting out has just

2348
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:52,109
been totally mind-blowing and I'm really

2349
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:55,319
thankful for you and your group in this

2350
01:41:52,109 --> 01:41:57,599
community so I wanted to say that well

2351
01:41:55,319 --> 01:41:59,399
thank you very much yeah it's a lot of

2352
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,100
great people in this community that got

2353
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:05,489
me into science to begin with so I have

2354
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:08,280
many many people in this world to thank

2355
01:42:05,489 --> 01:42:10,319
for it well thank you for following that

2356
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:11,729
curiosity and acting upon it it's one

2357
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:13,649
thing to have the concept of the idea

2358
01:42:11,729 --> 01:42:17,219
it's another to act upon it and do it

2359
01:42:13,649 --> 01:42:19,109
day after day so thank you and I wanted

2360
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:20,670
to just take a moment to talk a little

2361
01:42:19,109 --> 01:42:23,309
bit about what you were talking about

2362
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:25,619
Adrienne about plants it's you know

2363
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:27,270
mostly what I'm interested in and I

2364
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:30,210
believe that a lot of things that we

2365
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:33,540
ingest are actually a pesticide and that

2366
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:36,980
may actually be beneficial to our body

2367
01:42:33,539 --> 01:42:40,050
and to our intestine as well you know we

2368
01:42:36,979 --> 01:42:41,909
lemon say lemon rind you know you

2369
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:44,220
mentioned Artemisia you know that's

2370
01:42:41,909 --> 01:42:47,309
another one wormwood is something that

2371
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:50,670
is utilized and chrysanthemum is also

2372
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:53,640
utilized for you know 5000 years in

2373
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:54,659
ancient Chinese medicine so if you have

2374
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:57,270
a lung infection

2375
01:42:54,659 --> 01:43:00,149
you know chrysanthemum is utilized in

2376
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:02,700
those teas you know that you steep for

2377
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:05,939
overnight and then drink these so in

2378
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:08,039
small doses if it's directly from maybe

2379
01:43:05,939 --> 01:43:10,819
mother nature or the plant itself

2380
01:43:08,039 --> 01:43:13,890
without it being synthesized or

2381
01:43:10,819 --> 01:43:16,559
concentrated in the way that you know

2382
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:19,440
science does you know it's interesting

2383
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:22,830
to look at a possible differentiation of

2384
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:24,719
what Mother Nature makes naturally as

2385
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:28,079
far as paren thean is concerned and then

2386
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:30,150
also what we synthetically have turned

2387
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:32,899
into it and and what you know is

2388
01:43:30,149 --> 01:43:32,899
something to look at

2389
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:38,539
I just want to go ahead I was just gonna

2390
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:40,489
say you know there are a lot of you know

2391
01:43:38,539 --> 01:43:44,779
great compounds that come from plants

2392
01:43:40,489 --> 01:43:47,449
and if you look at I mean most medicine

2393
01:43:44,779 --> 01:43:49,670
has come from we found that a plant does

2394
01:43:47,449 --> 01:43:51,439
something we found some of the receptors

2395
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:53,630
that it activates to have that effect

2396
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:55,669
and then we tried to make something that

2397
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:57,710
does just that we made a drug that does

2398
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:59,930
just that or you know one of the first

2399
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:02,300
pesticides was nicotine that we found

2400
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:04,909
was nicotine from tobacco and then we

2401
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:07,220
made neonicotinoids which are a kind of

2402
01:44:04,909 --> 01:44:08,809
a catastrophe but nicotine as a

2403
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:12,050
pesticide is actually really effective

2404
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:14,720
and we learned a lot about how our minds

2405
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:16,579
work and how insects function just from

2406
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:20,050
studying you know what what these plants

2407
01:44:16,579 --> 01:44:24,279
make both has defense mechanisms and and

2408
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:26,720
many turn out to be medicines for humans

2409
01:44:24,279 --> 01:44:30,139
pretty trippy I just wanted to say I

2410
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:32,930
really love the view off of your porch

2411
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,789
there in the cookies it's just quite

2412
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:36,380
beautiful I was blown away by Sara

2413
01:44:34,789 --> 01:44:39,079
coming in earlier with the sort of

2414
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:40,609
Prairie wildflowers the tree in the

2415
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:41,960
background and then you came in with

2416
01:44:40,609 --> 01:44:43,489
this beautiful view you guys are

2417
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:44,390
crushing it it makes me want to let get

2418
01:44:43,489 --> 01:44:46,159
out of my office

2419
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:49,160
uh-huh you're welcome we're waiting for

2420
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:51,319
you anytime it's not far and you know a

2421
01:44:49,159 --> 01:44:52,849
lot of smoke in the background so we're

2422
01:44:51,319 --> 01:44:54,109
actually as you know you know we're

2423
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:57,380
dealing with a tremendous amount of

2424
01:44:54,109 --> 01:44:59,929
fires right now so we don't have quite

2425
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:01,489
the view that we normally do but but

2426
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:02,900
it's it's it's fine

2427
01:45:01,489 --> 01:45:04,279
they're keeping it to a low and the

2428
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:07,460
winds are coming through so we're good

2429
01:45:04,279 --> 01:45:11,059
yeah so that's the Hat higher up fire is

2430
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:13,279
the closest to you or um I'm not really

2431
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:14,990
sure I think that there's quite a few

2432
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:17,630
that are that are pretty all-around

2433
01:45:14,989 --> 01:45:18,920
pretty active all around yep there's

2434
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:20,869
some thunder and lightning that came

2435
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:22,850
through here and it's pretty easy to see

2436
01:45:20,869 --> 01:45:25,340
that a fire is gonna be caused from that

2437
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:27,710
so we've been enjoying the sunshine

2438
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:30,500
though hasn't had a really good

2439
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:33,260
beautiful hot summer in a long time so

2440
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:35,829
our gardens are really appreciating this

2441
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:38,750
hot summer so we're going for it as well

2442
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:40,939
beautiful yeah that's great

2443
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:42,829
the Kootenays for those of you that have

2444
01:45:40,939 --> 01:45:44,539
never been it's definitely a special

2445
01:45:42,829 --> 01:45:45,289
place to drive through I was lucky

2446
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:48,079
enough to go they

2447
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:50,630
in the 90s and I got turned on to the

2448
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:53,510
holy smokes boys Allen middle miss and

2449
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:55,819
Dustin sunflower and Paul to Feliz and

2450
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:58,310
my friend Terry and some other old

2451
01:45:55,819 --> 01:46:01,189
schoolers like man going to the co-op

2452
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:03,289
and Nelson and you know growing the a1

2453
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:06,319
magenta and helping mix oil with the

2454
01:46:03,289 --> 01:46:09,529
boys in the 90s that [ __ ] was that that

2455
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:11,559
was that was made me who I am today that

2456
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:14,630
was some of my first outdoor gardening

2457
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:16,100
exposure you know on these hillsides of

2458
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:18,050
the Kootenays and digging holes and

2459
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:20,180
mixing huge piles of dirt with these

2460
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:21,680
guys that was wonderful

2461
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:23,390
and then they would always like end up

2462
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:25,190
in trouble and defend themselves in

2463
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:28,070
court and then like win I was just like

2464
01:46:25,189 --> 01:46:29,750
you guys are amazing and for us that's

2465
01:46:28,069 --> 01:46:32,210
where it all came from you know we

2466
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:36,109
weren't able to hike seven hours out

2467
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:39,409
with any pesticides with any fertilizers

2468
01:46:36,109 --> 01:46:41,750
with any you know glacier rock dust or I

2469
01:46:39,409 --> 01:46:43,939
mean all you could possibly backpack out

2470
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:47,060
was your kid and a little bit of food

2471
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:47,989
you know so you did what you could so

2472
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,270
that's where all of our practices

2473
01:46:47,989 --> 01:46:52,729
originated from you know what is it that

2474
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:55,190
we can find out in this patches that we

2475
01:46:52,729 --> 01:46:57,829
can ferment and turn into nutrients for

2476
01:46:55,189 --> 01:47:00,199
the plants and for the microbiology so

2477
01:46:57,829 --> 01:47:03,140
you know live in that dream from the 90s

2478
01:47:00,199 --> 01:47:06,109
hasn't really ended it's just you know

2479
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:07,810
gotten better that's awesome well I've

2480
01:47:06,109 --> 01:47:10,489
definitely come in now

2481
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:12,410
definitely coming oh you're welcome you

2482
01:47:10,489 --> 01:47:15,050
got to come now I mean it's happening

2483
01:47:12,409 --> 01:47:17,090
things are bubbling out for sure and the

2484
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:17,930
lake is really hot it's great to swim in

2485
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:20,150
all day long

2486
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:21,440
Wow crazy that's something you don't

2487
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:24,319
hear every day in the Kootenays

2488
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:27,289
the lake is really hot well at least the

2489
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:29,000
top six inches for sure stay on the top

2490
01:47:27,289 --> 01:47:30,350
six inches you're pretty good yeah I

2491
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,029
know I've been I've been in the

2492
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:33,710
summertime where the lake gets warm and

2493
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:35,059
it's like this is like such a blessing

2494
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:37,550
you guys have to understand this is like

2495
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:41,180
a glacial fed lake fed lake that is so

2496
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:44,270
cold it throughout the rest of the year

2497
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:45,710
like very very cold beautiful to swim in

2498
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:49,090
for that short period of the summer

2499
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:52,159
though such a yeah awesome lake yeah

2500
01:47:49,090 --> 01:47:54,350
very cool we got a whole bunch of people

2501
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:56,059
talking about mountain-grown trichomes

2502
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:57,960
something just beautiful about

2503
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:59,940
mountain-grown trichomes

2504
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:01,800
something about those variables at

2505
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:06,059
certain elevations that allow the

2506
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:09,210
genetics to express its potential to a

2507
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:11,910
level that is not often replicated in an

2508
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:13,859
indoor grow room I have an affinity for

2509
01:48:11,909 --> 01:48:16,500
it I love sun-grown resin I love

2510
01:48:13,859 --> 01:48:18,659
tropical Sun grown resin it often blows

2511
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,909
my mind because terpenes are so volatile

2512
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:22,409
and we think oh if you can smell them in

2513
01:48:20,909 --> 01:48:24,510
the air that means they're evaporating

2514
01:48:22,409 --> 01:48:28,139
out and you're losing them yeah here I

2515
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:31,380
go to a field in Jamaica and it's 35 36

2516
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:33,900
degrees Celsius every day just beating

2517
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:36,390
down on these plants and you think well

2518
01:48:33,899 --> 01:48:38,309
if these terpenes are volatile like how

2519
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:41,430
can they continue to produce terpenes

2520
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:43,320
consistently while the Sun is blazing

2521
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:45,510
them off at the most accelerated rate

2522
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:50,460
I'm talking about like turn my skin red

2523
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:51,739
in 15-20 minutes like hot hot Sun blows

2524
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:55,199
my mind

2525
01:48:51,739 --> 01:48:58,649
look at the profile so they did lead

2526
01:48:55,199 --> 01:49:02,789
towards the sesquiterpene turn make

2527
01:48:58,649 --> 01:49:05,849
sense and you know we we are always

2528
01:49:02,789 --> 01:49:08,069
looking into different pest remedies

2529
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:09,720
here in a natural way you know and doing

2530
01:49:08,069 --> 01:49:13,349
lots of different tests and trials with

2531
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:15,570
different plant washes and what we've

2532
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:18,630
found has been tremendously successful

2533
01:49:15,569 --> 01:49:20,159
if you are growing in greenhouses is to

2534
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:21,449
do heat treatment and that just goes

2535
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:24,750
along with what you were talking about

2536
01:49:21,449 --> 01:49:27,960
Marcus you know you can utilize the Sun

2537
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:31,380
and the heat to get rid of pests on a

2538
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:35,189
massive level and you know talking about

2539
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:37,260
36 37 degrees on a constant when you

2540
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:39,089
heat up your greenhouse to that sort of

2541
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:42,180
level it's phenomenal how much the

2542
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:44,670
plants love that heat I mean you'll walk

2543
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:46,770
in there and after you've you've cranked

2544
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,180
up the heat to 38 or 40 in your

2545
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:50,250
greenhouse and the plants are just

2546
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:52,740
praying and they're so excited about the

2547
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:54,630
heat the rocks of Bikram yoga out of

2548
01:49:52,739 --> 01:49:57,059
there you can rock some Bikram yoga in

2549
01:49:54,630 --> 01:49:58,949
there oh yeah I mean you walk in it's an

2550
01:49:57,060 --> 01:50:00,090
instant sauna you know you're gonna want

2551
01:49:58,949 --> 01:50:03,750
to stay with your plants and everything

2552
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:06,090
but it's a it's a phenomenal remedy and

2553
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:08,420
also the plants really like it the pests

2554
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:10,680
don't but the plants really do

2555
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:11,520
interesting well humans we're always

2556
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:13,440
coming up with new

2557
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:18,630
ways to get these little bugs off of our

2558
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:20,789
food and out of our smoke I'm sure we'll

2559
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:22,199
continue to come up with the most unique

2560
01:50:20,789 --> 01:50:24,630
ways it's nice to see I was really

2561
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:26,970
excited with Peter from soil balance Pro

2562
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:30,960
coming in and giving us the the bacteria

2563
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:33,539
on the roots knowledge that that [ __ ]

01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:36,060
has not left my mind I actually brought

2565
01:50:33,539 --> 01:50:38,340
a bunch of it down to Jamaica he sent me

2566
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:40,650
a 50 grams of it and I brought it to

2567
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:42,960
Jamaica and will probably be testing out

2568
01:50:40,649 --> 01:50:45,000
one of our fields or half a field I

2569
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,189
don't know I'm not the grower the master

2570
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,930
grower will be the decider of that but I

2571
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:50,879
passed them on to Peter I passed him on

2572
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:54,539
the materials and I definitely look

2573
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:57,930
forward to seeing you know the the

2574
01:50:54,539 --> 01:50:59,909
results of ear in symbiosis I just

2575
01:50:57,930 --> 01:51:02,280
actually went onto their website

2576
01:50:59,909 --> 01:51:04,590
and five minutes ago if you saw me do I

2577
01:51:02,279 --> 01:51:06,719
just bought a 10 gram thing for a check

2578
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:09,329
go for fifty three eighty five so it's

2579
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:10,890
on its way thank you for educating me on

2580
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:12,559
it of course in the beginning then

2581
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:15,600
talking about what we're in Jamaica with

2582
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:18,870
there and of course getting back that's

2583
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:22,740
what I did that's awesome right on

2584
01:51:18,869 --> 01:51:24,119
Johnny be let me know how it goes I wish

2585
01:51:22,739 --> 01:51:25,829
I had plants in the ground right now I

2586
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:27,329
have a hundred plant license and I don't

2587
01:51:25,829 --> 01:51:30,119
have a single plant in the ground that's

2588
01:51:27,329 --> 01:51:32,340
kind of like maybe criminal isn't it I

2589
01:51:30,119 --> 01:51:35,309
should be growing plants but when you're

2590
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:37,440
as busy as I am the thing I can't do is

2591
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:38,880
plant a garden take care of it get it to

2592
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:40,349
the point where it needs an enormous

2593
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,150
amount of work and then other off to

2594
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:44,039
Jamaica for two weeks while my wife with

2595
01:51:42,149 --> 01:51:44,819
a toddler and two teenagers has to take

2596
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:46,500
care of it

2597
01:51:44,819 --> 01:51:47,909
I don't think so you're not allowed to

2598
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:51,869
take care of them to move so I'm not

2599
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:53,699
gonna happen not gonna happen out of

2600
01:51:51,869 --> 01:51:55,769
respect for my wife I haven't planted

2601
01:51:53,699 --> 01:51:57,840
any plants it is a shame I know it's

2602
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:59,790

2606
01:52:05,489 --> 01:52:12,869

left my first bounce dryer shift in this

2611
01:52:21,779 --> 01:52:25,389
container when I left the Jamaican when

2612
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:29,579
I came back it all turns

2613
01:52:25,389 --> 01:52:32,230

2617
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:40,510
that out and showed you what we were

2618
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:42,460
talking there and how there's definitely

2619
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:43,929
nothing ever sprayed on this plant so we

2620
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:47,319
know there was no pesticides or anything

2621
01:52:43,929 --> 01:52:51,579
that we're put in this so of course nice

2622
01:52:47,319 --> 01:52:52,719
and fresh resin but definitely um when

2623
01:52:51,579 --> 01:52:57,729
it hits a little bit of heat it just

2624

2639
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:43,000
you know what surprise over here listen

2640
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:44,949
I have a full respect for all of the

2641
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,079
different aspects of cannabis knowledge

2642
01:53:44,948 --> 01:53:48,969
but I really I respect the scientist I

2643
01:53:47,079 --> 01:53:50,559
love the the knowledge of going in and

2644
01:53:48,969 --> 01:53:52,750
figuring out these mechanisms these

2645
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:56,699
pathways learning what's happening and

2646
01:53:52,750 --> 01:54:00,448
explaining it to uh to us the laymen

2647
01:53:56,698 --> 01:54:04,259
because I I'm intrigued by it for sure

2648
01:54:00,448 --> 01:54:07,000
but you also advanced us politically and

2649
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:10,600
sociologically and on so many levels

2650
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:12,488
that push I mean we wouldn't be where we

2651
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:14,050
are without science we would still be

2652
01:54:12,488 --> 01:54:16,779
that oh you guys are just trying to get

2653
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:19,719
high but fortunately you know science is

2654
01:54:16,779 --> 01:54:21,819
consistently proving otherwise I'm gonna

2655
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:23,770
go out on a limb and say it was science

2656
01:54:21,819 --> 01:54:29,829
not a Cheech and Chong movie that Sanjay

2657
01:54:23,770 --> 01:54:33,940
Gupta realized he had been shamed you

2658
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:35,679
know I was lied to I was lied to he said

2659
01:54:33,939 --> 01:54:37,689
I was like right on that takes that

2660
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:38,750
takes a big man to kind of come out and

2661
01:54:37,689 --> 01:54:40,729
say you

2662
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:44,329
you kind of didn't know what was going

2663
01:54:40,729 --> 01:54:45,859
on and now you do sure-sure change

2664
01:54:44,329 --> 01:54:48,229
things for a lot of people those people

2665
01:54:45,859 --> 01:54:50,179
that would never have even considered

2666
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:52,009
such a thing without someone like him

2667
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:53,869
because you know it doesn't matter if

2668
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:56,510
it's their sons and their daughters and

2669
01:54:53,869 --> 01:54:59,300
their brothers and sisters and spouses

2670
01:54:56,510 --> 01:55:01,430
whatever telling them this like crazy it

2671
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:03,529
won't be until like Sanjay Gupta goes on

2672
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:06,140
CNN and says hey this shit's actually

2673
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:07,819
medicine like did you know that this

2674
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:10,210
[ __ ] was medicine yes mama I've been

2675
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:13,029
doing this for 25 years and absolutely

2676
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:16,100
yeah and that's interesting too because

2677
01:55:13,029 --> 01:55:18,319
what you just said is also really in

2678
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:19,730
lieu of and in light of you know all

2679
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:21,079
over the different people that have been

2680
01:55:19,729 --> 01:55:23,479
out there and already knowing that this

2681
01:55:21,079 --> 01:55:25,640
is a medicine for a long time and it's

2682
01:55:23,479 --> 01:55:27,589
not till Sanjay you know says something

2683
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:29,720
in the same way that it's not until the

2684
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:32,060
scientists that actually study it says

2685
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:34,760
something that it actually you know

2686
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:37,100
gives real meaning to it but you know

2687
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:39,650
all of us without the science of known

2688
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:42,020
for a long time you know if not beyond

2689
01:55:39,649 --> 01:55:45,199
you know thousands of years that this is

2690
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:47,750
an incredible medicine and we haven't

2691
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:49,579
had science so it's great that there's

2692
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:51,619
light shed on what we're doing now that

2693
01:55:49,579 --> 01:55:54,380
science is now interested in studying it

2694
01:55:51,619 --> 01:55:56,149
so what a beautiful fusion we had that

2695
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:59,210
we had the birth of science which was

2696
01:55:56,149 --> 01:56:01,039
the bio essay and the bio essay is the

2697
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:02,750
birth of science and we had we were

2698
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:04,460
trying it on ourselves and eventually it

2699
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:06,619
turned into a gas chromatographs and

2700
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:09,619
hplc s and proton @h NMR's

2701
01:56:06,619 --> 01:56:12,140
but the bottom line is we did we were

2702
01:56:09,619 --> 01:56:14,599
able to do all right I mean how how how

2703
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:18,200
much here's here's a funny story first

2704
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:19,400
time I made bubble out of mint because I

2705
01:56:18,199 --> 01:56:21,800
started playing around with a bunch of

2706
01:56:19,399 --> 01:56:24,199
different plants or Musante and camel

2707
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:26,270
mile and mint and lavender and rose and

2708
01:56:24,199 --> 01:56:30,619
I made bubble hash out of these plants

2709
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:33,800
back in late 90s early 2000s when I made

2710
01:56:30,619 --> 01:56:36,019
the mint I for whatever reason I just

2711
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:38,210
was like it was it was like really hash

2712
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:41,300
it was the most hash like substance like

2713
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:43,640
rose was pink and weird and that meant

2714
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:45,409
was hash it was gummy you think you

2715
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:47,930
could you could do this with it it was

2716
01:56:45,409 --> 01:56:49,729
like hash and so I was like right away I

2717
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:50,750
was like oh I'm gonna do a 50/50 rib

2718
01:56:49,729 --> 01:56:55,579
I'll take a rib

2719
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:57,380
the mint I'll take a rip of the of the

2720
01:56:55,579 --> 01:56:58,819
bubble hash I'll mix it in together and

2721
01:56:57,380 --> 01:57:01,340
then I'll take a night and I was still

2722
01:56:58,819 --> 01:57:03,289
burning back then I wasn't vaporizing I

2723
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:05,480
was using B Lian are probably a match

2724
01:57:03,289 --> 01:57:09,920
inspired by Sam at the time on a fresh

2725
01:57:05,479 --> 01:57:11,689
new stainless steel screen and I ripped

2726
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,730
this and I blew it out and I remember

2727
01:57:11,689 --> 01:57:15,919
because I knew the bubble hash really

2728
01:57:13,729 --> 01:57:18,139
well and it was it was coffee stuff

2729
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:20,720
let's just say it made you cough it was

2730
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:22,190
an expectorant to say the least I hit

2731
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:24,860
this thing and I blew it out and it was

2732
01:57:22,189 --> 01:57:28,849
so smooth and I was like wow

2733
01:57:24,859 --> 01:57:31,279
that's crazy so I like Google like mint

2734
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:35,539
cough suppressant and come up with this

2735
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:38,029
like Phillips Morris 23 million dollar

2736
01:57:35,539 --> 01:57:40,100
project of like figuring out what would

2737
01:57:38,029 --> 01:57:42,859
suppress cough with tobacco and they

2738
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:45,620
came up with mint like mentholated

2739
01:57:42,859 --> 01:57:47,630
mentholated cigarettes and so they spent

2740
01:57:45,619 --> 01:57:49,640
23 million dollars on that I felt like

2741
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:51,319
the Russians to the US when they spent

2742
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:53,240
all the money on this the pen that would

2743
01:57:51,319 --> 01:57:55,609
write in space and the Russians just

2744
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:57,469
brought the pencil I felt like the

2745
01:57:55,609 --> 01:57:59,960
Russians because I literally had figured

2746
01:57:57,470 --> 01:58:02,270
this [ __ ] out in like 25 minutes one

2747
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:05,000
gallon batch mint and bubble my bong a

2748
01:58:02,270 --> 01:58:07,250
lighter or a match and a stainless steel

2749
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,930
screen and here here this big company

2750
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:14,239
had to spend 23 million dollars to

2751
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:16,369
figure it out bioassay well via you know

2752
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:18,139
cough drops like Ricola cough drops

2753
01:58:16,369 --> 01:58:21,649
that's pretty much just menthol the

2754
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:23,360
thing in mint right yeah pretty

2755
01:58:21,649 --> 01:58:24,799
effective yeah well for those of you

2756
01:58:23,359 --> 01:58:26,210
that have never made mint ash I do

2757
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:29,110
implore you to go find some beautiful

2758
01:58:26,210 --> 01:58:32,060
mint all sorts of varieties mint is

2759
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:33,589
secretes it's essential oils and out of

2760
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:34,880
glandular trichomes there's a few

2761
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:38,150
different types of them on there and

2762
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:40,730
they really are very similar to canvas

2763
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:43,849
you get a much lower yield not quite as

2764
01:58:40,729 --> 01:58:45,619
low as rose which is incredibly low

2765
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:48,170
yielding it has a very small amount of

2766
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:49,939
these trichomes as you go looking for

2767
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:52,130
plants that secrete essential oils out

2768
01:58:49,939 --> 01:58:54,559
of trichomes you realize cannabis is at

2769
01:58:52,130 --> 01:58:57,260
the top of the heap top of the pile like

2770
01:58:54,560 --> 01:59:00,320
not numero uno the gold medalist each

2771
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:02,139
and every time Hey look at that Peter

2772
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:25,529

came on like that we just literally

2776
01:59:32,168 --> 01:59:36,939
spoke about Peter just so not so long

2777
01:59:35,078 --> 01:59:38,918
ago and now he's sharing an epic

2778
01:59:36,939 --> 01:59:40,510
waterfall I mean my god

2779
01:59:38,918 --> 01:59:43,719
that waterfall could be anywhere it

2780
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:48,039
looks like agua Azul in near the border

2781
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:51,219
of Guatemala and Mexico I'm sure it's

2782
01:59:48,038 --> 01:59:54,099
not but looks like it that's what it

2783
01:59:51,219 --> 01:59:57,788
looks like it's actually a sabino canyon

2784
01:59:54,099 --> 02:00:00,779
this beautiful valley in the desert so

2785

and share a minute of a beautiful

2795
02:00:21,578 --> 02:00:25,418
waterfall you see those huge cacti at

2796
02:00:23,618 --> 02:00:28,208
the end there when he turned to the pan

2797
02:00:25,418 --> 02:00:29,439
to the hill there was those giant cactus

2798
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:32,168
that's awesome

2799
02:00:29,439 --> 02:00:35,189
this is the vibe of hash Church it's

2800
02:00:32,168 --> 02:00:38,319
pretty good and you know getting back to

2801
02:00:35,189 --> 02:00:40,570
plants that have high resonance and high

2802
02:00:38,319 --> 02:00:43,359
turn in counts it's really awesome and I

2803
02:00:40,569 --> 02:00:45,158
encourage people to also make teas out

2804
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:47,049
of those they're all over the place

2805
02:00:45,158 --> 02:00:48,998
they're everywhere that you look and you

2806
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:50,979
can make teas so easily and you can

2807
02:00:48,998 --> 02:00:53,469
spray them on your gardens as a foliar

2808
02:00:50,979 --> 02:00:56,530
you can drench them into your soils

2809
02:00:53,469 --> 02:00:59,918
there's so many different uses and it's

2810
02:00:56,529 --> 02:01:02,648
fun to find out you know do one plan in

2811
02:00:59,918 --> 02:01:05,590
lavender and maybe another plan and I

2812
02:01:02,649 --> 02:01:08,019
don't know Oregon grape or or or fir

2813
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:10,630
leaves or something else and you can

2814
02:01:08,019 --> 02:01:12,729
really test to see what plants like

2815
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:15,460
different things so that's been pretty

2816
02:01:12,729 --> 02:01:19,150
interesting as well we were always

2817
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:21,640
you know looking at that mm-hmm Platt

2818
02:01:19,149 --> 02:01:23,589
symbiosis for certain I met I know Paul

2819
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:25,750
Stamets has been doing some absolutely

2820
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:27,730
incredible work with the fungi with the

2821
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:30,640
mushroom like everything that guy does

2822
02:01:27,729 --> 02:01:33,399
is like standing ovations level of

2823
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:36,039
quality we got to go see him speak not

2824
02:01:33,399 --> 02:01:38,619
too long ago in Richmond BC and it was

2825
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:39,130
definitely it was pretty good wouldn't

2826
02:01:38,619 --> 02:01:43,960
you say

2827
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:45,969
Natasha yeah it was a really inspiring

2828
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:47,710
talk and I wanted to ask you more about

2829
02:01:45,969 --> 02:01:49,090
what you're talking about and I know

2830
02:01:47,710 --> 02:01:53,050
I've asked you a few times but when you

2831
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:58,180
were making stuff with lavender how does

2832
02:01:53,050 --> 02:02:00,880
that compare the peppermint um oh no are

2833
02:01:58,180 --> 02:02:04,719
you talking about Terps yeah the both

2834
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:06,069
like I want to know lavender with when

2835
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:07,300
you're concentrating it and I also

2836
02:02:06,069 --> 02:02:08,170
thought that was really interesting what

2837
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,550
you were saying with the lavender

2838
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:12,520
pouring it on your plants

2839
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:17,350
were you using it for insecticides or

2840
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:19,570
what purpose yeah an overall wash you

2841
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:21,280
know to to keep your plants clean is a

2842
02:02:19,569 --> 02:02:23,259
really good idea in the same way that

2843
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:25,869
you want to keep your cyanobacteria on

2844
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:27,850
your leaf structure totally healthy and

2845
02:02:25,869 --> 02:02:30,010
it's great to look at a just a really

2846
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:32,350
easy microscope you know do a wash of

2847
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:33,880
lavender and it's really interesting a

2848
02:02:32,350 --> 02:02:35,710
lot of the beneficial bacteria will

2849
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:38,350
continue to stay on that leaf surface

2850
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:40,659
but get rid of a lot of the dusts and

2851
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:43,539
maybe some of the pathogenic fungi and

2852
02:02:40,659 --> 02:02:45,849
yeast so lavender is pretty fantastic

2853
02:02:43,539 --> 02:02:52,960
for just watching and keeping it a

2854
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:55,090
preventative leaf coating I wanted to

2855
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:58,180
say about lavender when I had my vapor

2856
02:02:55,090 --> 02:03:00,520
bar back in 2003 in Vancouver I had this

2857
02:02:58,180 --> 02:03:03,310
bar called the inhalation station of

2858
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:05,710
vaporization and we had a whole host a

2859
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:08,020
variety of vaporizers the aeromed from

2860
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:11,109
the German company that was really a

2861
02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:12,850
consortium of patients I believe even

2862
02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:14,859
cancer patients they were the ones that

2863
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:17,410
designed this vaporizer it was used with

2864
02:03:14,859 --> 02:03:19,089
a light bulb and it had a glass bowl we

2865
02:03:17,409 --> 02:03:21,729
have the volcano of course from Storz

2866
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:23,980
and Bickel we had the volatize ER from

2867
02:03:21,729 --> 02:03:25,809
David wheeler at the time who had the

2868
02:03:23,979 --> 02:03:28,138
quartz bowl with that all these really

2869
02:03:25,810 --> 02:03:30,360
unique vaporizers back then that

2870
02:03:28,139 --> 02:03:32,760
were in existence and we started

2871
02:03:30,359 --> 02:03:34,889
vaporizing herbs with people that came

2872
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:36,449
in from this you know customers that

2873
02:03:34,889 --> 02:03:38,340
walked in off the street and we'd have a

2874
02:03:36,448 --> 02:03:40,618
whole variety of different herbs to

2875
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:43,288
vaporize and lavender was was really the

2876
02:03:40,618 --> 02:03:44,938
one that people enjoyed the most and we

2877
02:03:43,288 --> 02:03:48,898
didn't even really realize how this

2878
02:03:44,939 --> 02:03:51,090
until it was but it was unbelievable the

2879
02:03:48,899 --> 02:03:53,130
the power of vaporizing lavender

2880
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:55,559
especially for people who had asthma or

2881
02:03:53,130 --> 02:03:57,630
bronchitis or any type of lung element

2882
02:03:55,559 --> 02:04:00,449
it seemed because if you look at how

2883
02:03:57,630 --> 02:04:03,479
lavender treats skin when skin is burned

2884
02:04:00,448 --> 02:04:05,759
lavender oil I think even lavender oil

2885
02:04:03,479 --> 02:04:07,979
was like the birth of aromatherapy I

2886
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,780
believe the story goes a French chemist

2887
02:04:07,979 --> 02:04:12,119
burns his hand on the Bunsen burner

2888
02:04:09,779 --> 02:04:14,908
sticks it in the lavender oil and

2889
02:04:12,118 --> 02:04:16,768
doesn't even get a blister it's very

2890
02:04:14,908 --> 02:04:19,049
very effective may be more effective

2891
02:04:16,769 --> 02:04:22,320
than aloe vera on burns so imagine the

2892
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:25,739
vapor being inhaled into the lungs very

2893
02:04:22,319 --> 02:04:28,168
very nice and smooth and mentholated as

2894
02:04:25,738 --> 02:04:31,279
well when you exhaled it but I had a

2895
02:04:28,168 --> 02:04:35,340
friend with a serious serious case of

2896
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:37,978
chronic God what was it it was

2897
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:41,219
bronchitis chronic bronchitis that he

2898
02:04:37,979 --> 02:04:43,320
had had almost 10 years and he started

2899
02:04:41,219 --> 02:04:45,538
vaporizing lavender out of the out of

2900
02:04:43,319 --> 02:04:47,969
the volcano bag and it was about two

2901
02:04:45,538 --> 02:04:50,188
weeks in that he was just like I don't

2902
02:04:47,969 --> 02:04:52,498
have bronchitis anymore man and I

2903
02:04:50,189 --> 02:04:56,099
haven't not had bronchitis for ten years

2904
02:04:52,498 --> 02:04:58,800
so I've always used it as well lavender

2905
02:04:56,099 --> 02:05:01,889
if I'm getting like sickness or like a

2906
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:04,679
lung element I'll vaporize lavender I

2907
02:05:01,889 --> 02:05:08,578
definitely stand by that it's a pretty

2908
02:05:04,679 --> 02:05:11,368
healing you could also do Mullen Mullen

2909
02:05:08,578 --> 02:05:13,139
is another wonderful and expect expect

2910
02:05:11,368 --> 02:05:15,328
your in you can take little bomb hits of

2911
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:17,609
that dry the long with your weed or you

2912
02:05:15,328 --> 02:05:20,998
can vaporize a as well

2913
02:05:17,609 --> 02:05:22,648
wild cherry leaf is a fantastic

2914
02:05:20,998 --> 02:05:24,418
expectorant and that's something that

2915
02:05:22,649 --> 02:05:26,249
has a tremendous amount of terpenes you

2916
02:05:24,418 --> 02:05:28,590
know if you can find a wild cherry tree

2917
02:05:26,248 --> 02:05:30,868
they grow around all up and down the

2918
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:32,729
Pacific Northwest the bark is utilized

2919
02:05:30,868 --> 02:05:35,098
it has a lot of terpenes in it but if

2920
02:05:32,729 --> 02:05:37,349
you hit the early spring leaves that

2921
02:05:35,099 --> 02:05:39,559
also can be burned and utilized as well

2922
02:05:37,349 --> 02:05:41,819
I mean we really could go on and on with

2923
02:05:39,559 --> 02:05:46,369
plant medicine but you're right

2924
02:05:41,819 --> 02:05:46,368
lavender is a fantastic ally

2925
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:55,750
absolutely as everyone froze up there I

2926
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:57,010
don't see many motions oh no there's

2927
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:59,649
some motion all of a sudden everything

2928
02:05:57,010 --> 02:06:01,750
that was weird everyone was like and

2929
02:05:59,649 --> 02:06:04,089
then they all started moving that was

2930
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:06,909
pretty good well played gentlemen and

2931
02:06:04,090 --> 02:06:08,680
ladies ladies and gentlemen I'm just

2932
02:06:06,909 --> 02:06:10,119
listening to some amazing knowledge

2933
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:12,280
that's coming through on the pesticide

2934
02:06:10,119 --> 02:06:13,960
man and the information that was drops

2935
02:06:12,279 --> 02:06:16,479
when he's kind of making me think and

2936
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:18,670
I'm gonna go work on my plants do some

2937
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:22,059
pruning in the animal side they've been

2938
02:06:18,670 --> 02:06:26,079
kind of living in the air and enjoying

2939
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:28,000
life beautiful so it was nice to have

2940
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:31,689
plants like I said I wish I had some

2941
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,430
myself it was nice to be in that acre in

2942
02:06:31,689 --> 02:06:36,210
Jamaica and walk around all those big

2943
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:39,550
beautiful lush cannabis plants and just

2944
02:06:36,210 --> 02:06:43,840
smell all the different terpene profiles

2945
02:06:39,550 --> 02:06:46,210
coming off of each different row which

2946
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:49,420
was each row was a different cultivar

2947
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:51,340
some I love Jack Frost there's something

2948
02:06:49,420 --> 02:06:54,069
about that Jack Frost that just has the

2949
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:55,510
most beautiful terpene profile I do kind

2950
02:06:54,069 --> 02:06:58,000
of look forward to the days where the

2951
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:59,949
names aren't really as much as the

2952
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,720
terpene profiles you know where we

2953
02:06:59,949 --> 02:07:04,510
really understand that what Jack Frost

2954
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:07,539
really is is it's a terpene profile and

2955
02:07:04,510 --> 02:07:09,520
there's going to be ones that are the

2956
02:07:07,539 --> 02:07:11,229
majority and ones that are the minority

2957
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:13,420
and there may even be many of them like

2958
02:07:11,229 --> 02:07:15,909
Sam said earlier that the labs aren't

2959
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:17,980
testing for I want to know everyone

2960
02:07:15,909 --> 02:07:20,649
that's present because I don't think

2961
02:07:17,979 --> 02:07:23,319
just because it has a lot or a little it

2962
02:07:20,649 --> 02:07:25,779
doesn't have the ability to affect the

2963
02:07:23,319 --> 02:07:30,699
profile a great deal I mean look at look

2964
02:07:25,779 --> 02:07:33,729
at an herb like what's the herb cilantro

2965
02:07:30,699 --> 02:07:35,859
so strong the tiniest little bit on a

2966
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:37,389
big meal especially for someone that's

2967
02:07:35,859 --> 02:07:39,399
like oh I don't like cilantro just put a

2968
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:41,260
tiny little bit of cilantro in someone's

2969
02:07:39,399 --> 02:07:44,349
meal it doesn't like cilantro

2970
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:45,909
it is unreal how strong that can be and

2971
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:48,300
I can tell you it's not the most

2972
02:07:45,909 --> 02:07:50,949
prevalent terpene in the in the batch

2973
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:54,909
I'm one of those people I don't like it

2974
02:07:50,949 --> 02:07:57,460
I just yeah it's no and yet you can

2975
02:07:54,909 --> 02:07:59,619
definitely tell and taste the slightest

2976
02:07:57,460 --> 02:08:01,689
hair it's not even funny

2977
02:07:59,619 --> 02:08:02,109
oh yeah and when it has a like a good

2978
02:08:01,689 --> 02:08:05,198
amount

2979
02:08:02,109 --> 02:08:07,809
like a pinch then it's like whoa that is

2980
02:08:05,198 --> 02:08:11,079
and I'm in California so it's impossible

2981
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:13,480
to find a salsa or you know a burrito or

2982
02:08:11,079 --> 02:08:16,389
anything without here is it even

2983
02:08:13,479 --> 02:08:20,259
sprinkle on top so yeah I have my own

2984
02:08:16,389 --> 02:08:23,020
help listen to what taste bud 420 just

2985
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:26,530
said you can [ __ ] a name but you

2986
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:29,020
can't [ __ ] a terpene profile I like

2987
02:08:26,529 --> 02:08:30,698
that it's like hard to [ __ ] that

2988
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:34,830
people will say a name and I'll smell it

2989
02:08:30,698 --> 02:08:37,029
and be like oh yeah I don't think so

2990
02:08:34,829 --> 02:08:41,319
there's a lot to be said in the nose

2991
02:08:37,029 --> 02:08:44,139
welcome back dr. Natasha cilantro makes

2992
02:08:41,319 --> 02:08:46,059
a great foliar - as well and if you let

2993
02:08:44,139 --> 02:08:47,949
it grow into you know the flower a

2994
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:50,560
little bit and it flowers up before it

2995
02:08:47,948 --> 02:08:53,379
turns into the coriander seed I mean the

2996
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:55,750
plants freakin love it so you can make a

2997
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:58,510
easy tea out about or you can fresh

2998
02:08:55,750 --> 02:09:00,609
press it into juice add a couple of

2999
02:08:58,510 --> 02:09:03,100
tablespoons into a gallon of water and

3000
02:09:00,609 --> 02:09:06,429
foliar spray and the plants just freak

3001
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:08,980
out on it bigquery you know small

3002
02:09:06,429 --> 02:09:10,630
amounts I just wanted to say coriander

3003
02:09:08,979 --> 02:09:12,549
seed essential oils also pretty

3004
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:18,100
interesting can you guys hear me okay

3005
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:19,389
now yeah yeah no coriander seed is

3006
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:22,630
really interesting especially for people

3007
02:09:19,389 --> 02:09:24,520
who don't like cilantro I was one of the

3008
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:27,400
people who hated cilantro for the

3009
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:29,590
longest time and then it was weird in my

3010
02:09:27,399 --> 02:09:32,408
20 something shifted and then all of a

3011
02:09:29,590 --> 02:09:34,900
sudden I like crave cilantro all the

3012
02:09:32,408 --> 02:09:36,399
time now and I like throw like handfuls

3013
02:09:34,899 --> 02:09:38,109
like I eat it more than I eat any other

3014
02:09:36,399 --> 02:09:39,549
green just like I buy a thing of

3015
02:09:38,109 --> 02:09:42,069
cilantro and I'll eat that within two

3016
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:44,170
days like on top of everything it's been

3017
02:09:42,069 --> 02:09:47,019
of the best chelating herbs out there

3018
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:49,480
for getting rid of heavy metals cilantro

3019
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:51,550
is but go ahead about coriander yeah and

3020
02:09:49,479 --> 02:09:53,829
then the coriander seed essential oil

3021
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:55,810
when I started working with that it just

3022
02:09:53,829 --> 02:09:58,420
blew me away the aroma of it because

3023
02:09:55,810 --> 02:10:01,210
it's actually 60% lit Elul which is

3024
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:02,949
similar to what's in lavender which is

3025
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:05,109
even higher in the lavender which is

3026
02:10:02,948 --> 02:10:08,079
crazy and so it has just this like

3027
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:12,579
lovely aroma and so even working with it

3028
02:10:08,079 --> 02:10:14,590
in micro fumes it's just a fun essential

3029
02:10:12,579 --> 02:10:15,729
oil that I was completely overlooking

3030
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:17,289
for the longest time

3031
02:10:15,729 --> 02:10:19,209
I just was assuming it smelled like the

3032
02:10:17,289 --> 02:10:23,079
greens but it smells completely

3033
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:24,850
different aria vada uses that for a lot

3034
02:10:23,079 --> 02:10:27,699
of different ailments they use it both

3035
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:30,700
internally and also as flushes they use

3036
02:10:27,699 --> 02:10:33,639
it externally they use it to elevate the

3037
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:35,979
the mood and there's a black coriander

3038
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:37,869
that's especially useful for medicinal

3039
02:10:35,979 --> 02:10:40,419
purposes and you can grow that type of

3040
02:10:37,869 --> 02:10:49,090
cilantro as well and it just even has a

3041
02:10:40,420 --> 02:10:54,779
higher terpene residual yeah and it's I

3042
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:56,739
just I find it so fun working with just

3043
02:10:54,779 --> 02:10:58,539
working with these plants in different

3044
02:10:56,738 --> 02:11:00,819
ways and similar to cannabis you think

3045
02:10:58,539 --> 02:11:02,409
like like if you're just talking about

3046
02:11:00,819 --> 02:11:04,029
the cannabis plant it's like well what

3047
02:11:02,409 --> 02:11:05,619
part of the plan how you're using it and

3048
02:11:04,029 --> 02:11:07,479
how's it processed and we have to

3049
02:11:05,619 --> 02:11:09,279
remember that every single plant is just

3050
02:11:07,479 --> 02:11:10,750
as complex as cannabis is and can be

3051
02:11:09,279 --> 02:11:12,880
used in all these different ways and

3052
02:11:10,750 --> 02:11:13,960
what you're using the flower for might

3053
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:16,930
be a completely different application

3054
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:19,029
for the root of the plant or processed

3055
02:11:16,930 --> 02:11:20,950
in different ways so it's I haven't

3056
02:11:19,029 --> 02:11:23,259
worked a lot with teas I've done

3057
02:11:20,949 --> 02:11:25,238
obviously teas drinking and even I've

3058
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:27,010
done a little bit of herbal teas for

3059
02:11:25,238 --> 02:11:29,949
like hair rinses and experimented with

3060
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:33,159
not even just for coloring but like I've

3061
02:11:29,949 --> 02:11:35,050
used hibiscus teas for hair and it's

3062
02:11:33,159 --> 02:11:38,139
crazy it makes your hair feel just like

3063
02:11:35,050 --> 02:11:41,110
really nice and silky and like thick and

3064
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:43,360
even hibiscus is this beautiful red

3065
02:11:41,109 --> 02:11:45,729
color and it has it's one of the highest

3066
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:48,789
antioxidant teas and also good for your

3067
02:11:45,729 --> 02:11:49,750
heart do you work with hibiscus or any I

3068
02:11:48,789 --> 02:11:51,488
do

3069
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:53,710
I love hibiscus I think that it's really

3070
02:11:51,488 --> 02:11:55,119
wonderful you know people and re veda

3071
02:11:53,710 --> 02:11:58,600
has been using it for a really long time

3072
02:11:55,119 --> 02:12:01,449
to strengthen the Venus you know tissue

3073
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:03,520
and our fine capillary tissue and I

3074
02:12:01,449 --> 02:12:05,590
always feel like whenever I'm making a

3075
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:07,090
wash out of hibiscus I can really notice

3076
02:12:05,590 --> 02:12:08,470
that the leaf structure gets a little

3077
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:11,289
bit thicker because we'll always do

3078
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:12,820
something maybe three times in a row to

3079
02:12:11,289 --> 02:12:15,100
really understand it because plants

3080
02:12:12,819 --> 02:12:17,319
respond so quickly to it but I've

3081
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:20,320
noticed with hibiscus that it's almost

3082
02:12:17,319 --> 02:12:22,988
thickened the outer layer excuse me of

3083
02:12:20,319 --> 02:12:24,759
the leaf structure so I love hibiscus I

3084
02:12:22,988 --> 02:12:27,209
think it's really amazing for a lot of

3085
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:27,210
different values

3086
02:12:35,050 --> 02:12:40,570
what do you have to say about that Sarah

3087
02:12:37,539 --> 02:12:44,329
with your hair blowing in the wind

3088
02:12:40,569 --> 02:12:46,939
mm ooh just like I'm loving all the

3089
02:12:44,329 --> 02:12:48,890
knowledge and the fact that I am on a

3090
02:12:46,939 --> 02:12:50,479
farm here and I have all the sorts of

3091
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:52,220
these plants I've got like giant

3092
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:54,319
Seabiscuit plants and I bring in and out

3093
02:12:52,220 --> 02:12:56,510
every year and I've got big patch and

3094
02:12:54,319 --> 02:12:59,840
mint and raspberry I've got altered so

3095
02:12:56,510 --> 02:13:01,400
it's like I I love the idea of playing

3096
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,779
around with all this stuff and and

3097
02:13:01,399 --> 02:13:05,000

3101
02:13:09,949 --> 02:13:15,769
type of knowledge as you but I really

3102
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:17,630
hate being able to come on and plug the

3103

buds and nice concentrates she was

3113
02:13:44,779 --> 02:13:49,960
always kind of had a good ear in the

3114
02:13:48,050 --> 02:13:54,920
ground when it comes to quality of

3115
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:57,890
cannabis products there she goes where

3116

3117
02:13:57,890 --> 02:14:03,920

02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:06,260
exactly where but somewhere yeah well I

3119
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:08,350
met her once I think it was that lift

3120
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:10,880
when we were all we all went out for

3121
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:12,500
dinner at one point but we were a big

3122
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:16,220
group of us so we just had like a nice

3123
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:18,050
little chat but it's cool to hang out

with her more I think I remember that

3125
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:22,279
dinner I think we decided to sit on

3126
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:26,600
those strange square cushions instead of

3127
02:14:22,279 --> 02:14:28,460
an actual table and chairs just because

3128
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:35,679
we all wanted to eat that sound from

3129
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:38,408
their hotel room some hotel restaurant

3130
02:14:35,679 --> 02:14:50,019

3148
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:50,889
through my fingers right yeah I think I

3149
02:15:48,788 --> 02:15:52,779
accidentally muted chimera I got a

3150
02:15:50,889 --> 02:15:54,760
little eager last episode it was mute

3151

keeping the sound nice and come where I

3152
02:15:54,760 --> 02:16:02,139
was mid-sentence muted oh I've done that

3153
02:16:00,309 --> 02:16:10,719
it's always harder to unmute them it's

3154
02:16:02,139 --> 02:16:12,788
not as quick well even worse is when you

3155
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:14,800
don't realize the cursor is on the

3156
02:16:12,788 --> 02:16:17,288
Google Chat and then you go to type

3157
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:19,840
something and you hit like all the right

3158
02:16:17,288 --> 02:16:22,779
things to actually open up and then

3159
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:26,828
eject someone from the room with just

3160
02:16:22,779 --> 02:16:32,619
the keyboard that's happened a few times

3161
02:16:26,828 --> 02:16:34,978
to me it is what it is I wish I had some

3162
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:37,149
of my drone footage from Jamaica

3163
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:40,358
uploaded so I could share with you guys

3164
02:16:37,148 --> 02:16:46,929
some of that footage because it was it

3165
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:48,780
was good it was good nobody with shotgun

3166
02:16:46,929 --> 02:16:51,489
shooting down drones

3167
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:53,770
nobody was shotguns shooting down drones

3168
02:16:51,489 --> 02:16:56,469
nope nope sir I mean we're on a 20 acre

3169
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:58,751
property that we're that we are in

3170
02:16:56,469 --> 02:17:02,289
control of so and I don't fly the drone

3171
02:16:58,751 --> 02:17:03,940
off of that 20 acres but I'm sure you

3172
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:08,950
could fly your drone somewhere in

3173
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:10,780
Jamaica where it would get shot down but

3174
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:11,381
I wouldn't suggest it things are

3175
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:13,421
expensive

3176
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:15,460
drones every time you put it up you're

3177
02:17:13,421 --> 02:17:18,659
just nervous like oh is this going to be

3178
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:21,550
the time at this two thousand dollar

3179
02:17:18,659 --> 02:17:24,159
camera that's basically attached to a

3180
02:17:21,550 --> 02:17:26,019
drone is going to fall on the ground and

3181
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:27,460
smash into a million pieces it's a

3182
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:30,040
horrible feeling I hope that you never

3183
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:31,149
have to feel it Sam I really do even

3184
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:35,680
though you've probably patented that

3185
02:17:31,149 --> 02:17:37,479
feeling already I'm I'm not sure if you

3186
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:42,059
have to feel a feeling before you patent

3187
02:17:37,479 --> 02:17:46,421
it yeah

3188
02:17:42,059 --> 02:17:46,751
okay so Adrian tell us more what you're

3189

compounds are Alex Mariana SH

3201
02:18:17,889 --> 02:18:23,680
interestingly am 404 it was discovered

3202
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:27,069
that tylenol breaks down into AM 404 and

3203
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:28,809
it's an and amide reuptake inhibitor so

3204
02:18:27,069 --> 02:18:31,239
tylenol actually some of the

3205
02:18:28,809 --> 02:18:32,889
anti-anxiety and potentially

3206
02:18:31,239 --> 02:18:37,421
pain-killing effects from of Tylenol

3207
02:18:32,889 --> 02:18:39,671
come from it were increasing the

3208
02:18:37,421 --> 02:18:41,260
activity of endocannabinoids it's that's

3209
02:18:39,671 --> 02:18:42,399
not where its toxicity comes from that

3210
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:44,860
comes from something else in the liver

3211
02:18:42,399 --> 02:18:47,680
but so he's been involved in a lot of

3212
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:50,319
drug design and kind of designing drugs

3213
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:56,470
based on understanding how cannabinoids

3214
02:18:50,319 --> 02:18:59,380
work and so that's what he's there

3215
02:18:56,469 --> 02:19:01,769
conferences about something on drug

3216
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:04,090
design and drugs of abuse but

3217
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:08,081
that it should be interesting it's in

3218
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:10,961
Boston in like two weeks or so so that's

3219
02:19:08,081 --> 02:19:13,389
coming up nice what sounds like an

3220
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:14,050
interesting conference yeah interesting

3221
02:19:13,389 --> 02:19:19,090
people

3222
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:21,939
hopefully presumably hey are you going

3223
02:19:19,091 --> 02:19:24,550
to the European cannabinoid research

3224
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:28,001
conference the ICM yeah

3225
02:19:24,550 --> 02:19:29,229
hopefully that ones in September out in

3226
02:19:28,001 --> 02:19:33,399
York alone and there's there's I

3227
02:19:29,229 --> 02:19:34,779
actually just saw the speaker line up

3228
02:19:33,399 --> 02:19:38,159
just came out for that one and there

3229
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:41,051
there's a bit on pesticides and like and

3230
02:19:38,159 --> 02:19:45,280
health there's a bit about medicine and

3231
02:19:41,050 --> 02:19:46,751
kind of what each country's what each

3232
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:50,409
country is experiencing in terms of

3233
02:19:46,751 --> 02:19:52,810
regulations and just legalization

3234
02:19:50,409 --> 02:19:54,550
overall so France has someone speaking I

3235
02:19:52,810 --> 02:19:58,630
believe Germany has someone speaking

3236
02:19:54,550 --> 02:20:01,350
Canada someone speaking he's at least

3237
02:19:58,630 --> 02:20:03,430
one person from the US speaking about

3238
02:20:01,351 --> 02:20:04,810
some of the struggles in the US I'm not

3239
02:20:03,431 --> 02:20:07,030
sure if there actually are specific to

3240
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:09,640
different states but I'm hoping to go to

3241
02:20:07,030 --> 02:20:14,501
that one because that will have a lot of

3242
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:16,331
great scientists there Ethan Russo and

3243
02:20:14,501 --> 02:20:19,899
Jhon mark who are both talking about

3244
02:20:16,331 --> 02:20:23,409
quality of marijuana so two good people

3245
02:20:19,899 --> 02:20:25,960
to be speaking on that imagine if Ethan

3246
02:20:23,409 --> 02:20:27,851
Russo was unlike the Grateful Dead lot

3247
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:30,119
and came up to you it was like I'm gonna

3248
02:20:27,851 --> 02:20:33,310
tell you about the quality of cannabis

3249
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:36,271
yeah you would for sure know more than

3250
02:20:33,310 --> 02:20:39,069
anyone else on the lot it's not awesome

3251
02:20:36,271 --> 02:20:40,900
yeah Ethan's a great guy and he also

3252
02:20:39,069 --> 02:20:43,270
he's one of those people who's really

3253
02:20:40,899 --> 02:20:45,640
you know he not about genetic

3254
02:20:43,271 --> 02:20:47,950
engineering and pesticides but really

3255
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:49,899
organic practices and just growing well

3256
02:20:47,950 --> 02:20:52,240
and breeding well to make make good

3257
02:20:49,899 --> 02:20:57,369
strains and you know he's he's been a

3258
02:20:52,239 --> 02:21:00,069
big force behind keeping the side of the

3259
02:20:57,370 --> 02:21:02,980
science on marijuana - you know good

3260
02:21:00,069 --> 02:21:06,029
agricultural practices and I think a lot

3261
02:21:02,979 --> 02:21:11,059
of people owe them some things for that

3262
02:21:06,030 --> 02:21:13,459
absolutely oh we lost dragonfly medicine

3263
02:21:11,059 --> 02:21:19,578
she's got a bounce you'll be back

3264
02:21:13,459 --> 02:21:21,529
another weekend excellent well I don't

3265
02:21:19,578 --> 02:21:22,878
know pretty chill I'm like I think

3266
02:21:21,529 --> 02:21:25,399
because it's the first time I've been

3267
02:21:22,879 --> 02:21:27,649
back for a couple of weeks that I'm

3268
02:21:25,398 --> 02:21:30,680
anxious to go hang out with my family

3269
02:21:27,648 --> 02:21:33,078
and go spend the Sunday afternoon doing

3270
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:34,699
Sunday afternoon things so I don't know

3271
02:21:33,078 --> 02:21:36,918
you guys have anything else you want to

3272
02:21:34,699 --> 02:21:39,369
cover on today's hash turtle shift or

3273
02:21:36,918 --> 02:21:41,119
shall we cover it another weekend

3274
02:21:39,369 --> 02:21:43,189

sometime I would be really in this one

3280
02:21:55,760 --> 02:22:02,898
to see if any of these compounds are

3281
02:22:00,498 --> 02:22:05,298
actually produced in the resin or just

3282
02:22:02,898 --> 02:22:06,228
in the rest of the plant because makes a

3283
02:22:05,299 --> 02:22:11,119
big difference

3284
02:22:06,228 --> 02:22:14,389
