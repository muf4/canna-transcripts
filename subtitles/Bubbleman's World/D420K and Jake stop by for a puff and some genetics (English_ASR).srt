00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,560
in your water go for it I must have put

96
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,799
it in your water Darren oh yeah I'll

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,199

99
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,960
yeah it doesn't need to be on there

100
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,959
it'll just cause like mold or problems

101
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,159
bet

102
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:30,279
you so we just wrap the bottom the

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,120
base give it that life

104
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,000
and then you can put that one inside the

105
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,000
one that says

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,560
CSD East Coast Sour Diesel yeah Sour

208
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,479
Diesel

209
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:37,319
exactly you got it perfect strip off

210
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,240
that oh you don't even need to

211
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,519
guess

212
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,440
boom great way to secure some strains

213
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,278
these strains will be secure for easily

214
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
48 Hours like this and if you put them

215
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:51,078
in a fridge obviously for much

216
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,079
longer and they'll root no problem you

217
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:56,199
guys root in a power cloner or an air

218
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:58,359
cloner or do you do rockol or pux or

219
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,399
usually I do Puck but right now I'm just

220
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,079
uh starting up my new uh hydroponic tray

221
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,039
I can't believe how easy the air power

222
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,919
cloners are I know like it's

223
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,838
unbelievable you take that and put it in

224
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:12,360
a power cloner it is for sure rooting in

225
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,560
like six or seven days I've had them 3

226
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,079
days just massive root to three days

227
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:20,958
like I usually like five to seven yeah

228
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,278
but six Ines of roots and sometimes I

229
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,359
don't know what it go something goes

230
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,799
wrong yeah and you just want root you

231
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,519
want root now yeah two months ago by

232
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,278
they're live that's weird you look in

233
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,440
there there's no root what's wrong

234
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,958
what's wrong I know you know the water

235
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,600
you try to get the water perfect

236
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,638
temperature you get the pH at perfect

237
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,920
temperature and you look like what is

238
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,600
wrong like yeah you know first two times

239
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:48,278
is great what do you need tell me yeah

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,159
exactly I hope go east coast Sour Diesel

241
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,799
couple of East Coast sour diesels what

242
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,039
else I'm pretty happy about this stream

243
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,039
because this one is one of my favorite

244
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,278
flavors and tastes from before that I

245
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,519
remember all right you just have that

246
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:02,919
right there right okay now we got to few

247
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,959
this one up here this one yeah all right

248
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,360
couple of nice clones on the bottom

249
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,879
there yeah looking

250
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,759
R although I could potentially top that

251
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,600
plant too if you no you want to you want

252
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,200
to Bud that one out don't you I was

253
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,839
going to but take the bottom ones man

254
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,360
their bottoms are good clones too buddy

255
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,320
oh yeah they are no sense taking that

256
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,959
top that's that could be a beauty I know

257
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,760
but that's such a small plant once those

258
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,439
two branches are gone it's kind of like

259
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,958
maybe I'll just take the top off too and

260
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,720
Bush it out more cuz if I take the third

261
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:35,119
branch off as well and the top I could

262
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
uh have a nice little Bush a super crop

263
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,120
it pinch the top and you'll [ __ ] yeah

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,839
exactly it would grow it too grow pinch

265
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,639
